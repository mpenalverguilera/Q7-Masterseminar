abstract = {Humanoid robots will be able to assist humans in their daily life, in particular due to their versatile action capabilities. However, while these robots need a certain degree of autonomy to learn and explore, they also should respect various constraints, for access control and beyond. We explore the novel field of incorporating privacy, security, and access control constraints with robot task planning approaches. We report preliminary results on the classical symbolic approach, deep-learned neural networks, and modern ideas using large language models as knowledge base. From analyzing their trade-offs, we conclude that a hybrid approach is necessary, and thereby present a new use case for the emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence.},

abstract = {The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) systems has transformed industries through real-time monitoring and automation, generating vast and heterogeneous data streams. As IoT networks expand, the increasing volume and diversity of data, spanning real-time telemetry, device logs, and historical records, complicate the management of IoT systems, including system monitoring, analysis, and reasoning. To address this challenge, we introduce LUMEN (Large Language Models as Unified Multi-Agent Systems for IoT ENhancement), a novel approach combining multi-agent Large Language Models (LLMs), knowledge graphs, and heterogeneous databases to enable cognitive digital twins for IoT observability. LUMEN models IoT systems as knowledge graphs, capturing device relationships and metadata while monitoring data is stored in time-series or object databases. Specialized LLM-based agents collaborate dynamically to analyze IoT systems and explain the findings in natural language, generating and executing analysis code when necessary. Integrated with off-the-shelf network monitoring tools, LUMEN facilitates semantic reasoning and human-in-the-loop collaboration, delivering adaptive insights across diverse data contexts. Two industrial case studies demonstrate the ability of LUMEN to automate analysis workflows, enhance system adaptability, and provide interpretable analytics. This work advances IoT observability by integrating LLMs, semantic intelligence, and explainable analytics into a scalable and adaptive solution using a multi-agent architecture for complex IoT systems.},
