The EARL consists of one upper base and two robotic legs. The upper base is worn through a backpack around the upper body and the robotic legs are distributed around the lower body. In this paper, the research subject is the robotic legs of the EARL. In order to ensure that the human body can have better movements matching under the state of wearing the EARL, and realize efficient, flexible and stable coordinated movements, a planning algorithm of hybrid dual-mode gait includes walking and running for movements of the robotic legs is proposed. The gait planning is an important means and a foundation of the development and design of the robotic legs. The algorithm is set up according to the dynamic model of the EARL. The dynamic model is established by using the multi-level inverted pendulum with the joint deformation when the robotic legs hit the ground. The desired joint trajectories of the EARL are planned by the piecewise function and the gait cycle is determined by an experiment. Ultimately the prototype simulation is set up to verify the tracking performance of the EARL. The proposed validity is ensured by the simulation. The simulation results show the planned trajectories are continuous curves. The angular velocity of joints minus to 0 is to call for an end or to start another cycle. It can ensure the continuity and stability of the EARL. 6 sudden changes of each figure represent 6 selected gait phases. In a word, the robotic legs of the EARL can achieve efficient and stable moving by tracking the planned trajectories. The hybrid dual-mode gait planning algorithm is not only a supplement of the gait planning theory, but the improvement of the cooperative control strategy between the robotic legs and the wearer's legs as well.

However, these structures normally are not sent in one piece due to current launch vehicles’ size and load capacity limitations. An alternative is to send individual components and subassemblies and perform the final assembly of structures in orbit, mainly using robotic manipulators that execute simple manipulation tasks. However, fixed manipulator systems have limited reachability; therefore, new approaches are required to endow robotic systems with extended mobility and enhanced versatility.Several European projects have developed initial prototypes of robotic systems that could execute On-orbit services. In the MOSAR project, a 7 degrees of freedom (DoF) Walking Manipulator (WM) robot performed locomotion and manipulation (loco-manipulation) tasks for the assembly of modular satellites. In this project, the robot and the modules of the satellite were equipped with Standard Interconnects (SI), which provide mechanical, power, and data connectivity for the different components and also enable a straightforward way for their manipulation using a suitable SI as a robotic end effector. A ground scenario was developed to evaluate the system under laboratory conditions. To enhance the reachability and mobility of the WM, the project MIRROR, funded by ESA, pursued the development of a Multi-Armed Robot (MAR) capable of executing loco-manipulation tasks to assemble modular space structures. This system consists of three robotic subsystems, two 7-DoF arms attached to a torso with an extra DoF on its base.This paper presents a hybrid motion planner for generating trajectories for loco-manipulation tasks using the MAR system. The developed hybrid planner combines a high-level layer that determines the necessary contact states between the robot and the structure, and a low-level layer that plans the joint trajectories among contiguous contact states. The high-level planner implements task-dependent heuristics and a depth-first search approach to reduce the search time for possible contact states. The low-level layer implements an optimization-based motion planner, in particular the Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Motion Planning (STOMP). Using an optimization-based approach reduces the random component associated typically with sampling-based motion planners, thus generating as well smoother trajectories. STOMP used as objective function the minimization of joint torques required for executing the different tasks. The performance of the MAR system is evaluated in simulation and on a ground demonstration scenario that simulates the assembly of a modular primary mirror of a space telescope, demonstrating different tasks, including robotic locomotion and manipulation of the mirror parts.","1095-323X","979-8-3503-0462-6","10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521183","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10521183","","Space vehicles;Legged locomotion;Torso;Mars;Satellites;Mirrors;Task analysis","","1","","24","IEEE","13 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, a semantic notion of state has been missing in most current accounts of BDI agent execution, making it impossible to assess at design time if a coordination model/plan is able to achieve the goal. Thus, in this paper, we introduce a framework that permits us to identify the state that accrues at any point in agent execution.

The presented architecture consists of three layers, namely, the decision layer, the distributed estimated layer, and the local control layer. Specifically, in the decision layer, we propose the dynamic parameter and trajectory fitting Q-learning (DPTF-Q-learning) algorithm to find a feasible continuous trajectory to the target in an unknown environment. In addition, two dynamic parameters are proposed and introduced into the DPTF-Q-learning algorithm to shorten the required minimum number of steps in the training process. Then, the distributed estimated layer is designed to broadcast the continuous trajectory generated from the decision layer based on the directed communication topology containing a spanning tree. In the local control layer, the cooperative tracking control (CTC) algorithm is proposed to achieve cooperative tracking for MASs in the presence of uncertain dynamics and external disturbances. The sufficient conditions for achieving cooperative tracking control are rigorously derived by employing Lyapunov argument. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.Note to Practitioners—This paper is motivated by the need of developing an integrated path planning and control method for cooperative tracking of multi-agent systems in a no-signal environment and without the presence of users. Most related works are limited to separate fields: 1) most existing path planning techniques are only applicable to a single agent and discrete environments, and 2) most existing cooperative tracking algorithms focus on guaranteeing control stability and error convergence without decision-making capabilities. To address the above issues, this work proposes a hierarchical control architecture based on reinforcement learning for multi-agent systems to achieve path planning and cooperative tracking tasks. In addition, multi-agent systems exhibit strong robustness and fault tolerance due to their inherent characteristics, so the above mentioned research can be well applied to post-disaster rescue, intelligent logistics, future war, and so on.

While socially assistive robots integrated with serious games show promise, traditional robotic platforms often lack the flexibility to adapt dynamically to users’ fluctuating cognitive abilities and engagement levels. We propose a novel self-adaptive framework that combines the MAPE-K (Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Execute, Knowledge) control loop with the CORTEX cognitive robotics architecture. Implemented on the EBOv2 robotic platform, our system supports two popular serious games—""Simon Says"" for attention and memory training, and ""Pasapalabras"" (a word quiz game) for semantic and linguistic stimulation. Specialized software agents within CORTEX dynamically modify these games’ structural and parametric elements, guided by multimodal inputs such as user performance metrics and emotional cues. A simulation-based evaluation using profiles derived from established cognitive models (ranging from high cognitive capacity to mild impairment) demonstrates the system’s adaptability and reliability. Our measurements show latency well below the 200 ms threshold—ensuring seamless real-time reconfiguration. Beyond response times, the adaptive difficulty mechanism effectively tailors challenge levels to each user profile, stabilizing within five sessions and improving overall engagement metrics compared to non-adaptive configurations. Users in the simulated high-capacity profile consistently progressed to advanced difficulty levels without frustration. In contrast, users with milder impairments benefited from gentle ramps in a challenge that enhanced task completion rates. These findings underscore the technical feasibility and potential therapeutic value of agent-based robotic systems for personalized cognitive stimulation.

However, robotic arms are rarely entrusted to perform large assembly tasks without a human in the loop because of the high cost of the hardware involved. As our presence in space grows, developing advanced autonomous robotic systems may be the way forward as time lags associated with teleoperation can easily cripple future space missions operating beyond earth orbit. This research focuses on the derivation of an autonomous control system for spacecraft assembly applications that blends Jacobian path following and visual servoing. Jacobian path following assumes the environment is well known and plans end effector trajectories whose performance for assembly may suffer in dynamic or uncertain environments. Visual servoing approaches use feedback from an effector attached camera and can avoid dynamic obstacles, but provides no guarantee of success if the sensor cannot keep the goal location in its field of view and often traverses inefficient manipulator trajectories. This work proposes a hybrid approach that combines both approaches to improve the performance of a robotic manipulator in both known and unknown environments. The robotic systems are simulated using the proposed hybrid controller. The hybrid controller is developed in MATLAB using a kinematic simulation of a two degree of freedom robotic arm operating in a single plane with a simplified camera model. Following successful implementation of the simulation, a more complex robotic arm is simulated in 3D space. The controller is integrated into an existing robotic arm platform (UR5 Industrial Manipulator) for a proof of concept.

Most recently, the powerful capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs) make neural planners become very attractive because of their superior planning performance over the classical methods. In particular, graph neural network (GNN)-enabled motion planner has demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance across a set of challenging high-dimensional planning tasks, motivating the efficient hardware acceleration to fully unleash its potential and promote its widespread deployment in practical applications.To that end, in this paper we perform preliminary study of the efficient accelerator design of the GNN-based neural planner, especially for the neural explorer as the key component of the entire planning pipeline. By performing in-depth analysis on the different design choices, we identify that the hybrid architecture, instead of the uniform sparse matrix multiplication (SpMM)-based solution that is popularly adopted in the existing GNN hardware, is more suitable for our target neural explorer. With a set of optimization on microarchitecture and dataflow, several design challenges incurred by using hybrid architecture, such as extensive memory access and imbalanced workload, can be efficiently mitigated.

Fundamental robotic tasks such as grasping, pick and place, trajectory following are at present solved using conventional forward and inverse kinematics (IK), dynamics and trajectory planning, whereas we learn these complex tasks using past experiences. In this paper, we explore developing behavior based robotic manipulation using reinforcement learning, more specifically learning directly from experiences through interactions with the real world and without knowing the transition model of the environment. Here, we propose a multi agent paradigm to gather experiences from multiple environments in parallel along with a model for populating new generation of agents using Evolutionary Actor-Critic Algorithm (EACA). The agents are of actor-critic architecture and both of them comprises of general purpose neural networks. The actor-critic architecture enables the model to perform well both in high dimensional state space and high dimensional action space which is very crucial for all robotic applications. The proposed algorithm is benchmarked with respect to different multi agent paradigm but keeping the agent’s architecture same. Reinforcement learning, being highly data intensive, requires the use of the CPU and GPU cores to be done judiciously for sampling the environment as well as for training, the details of which have been described here.

Current methods focus on how to obtain a stable and reliable grasping pose in object level, while little work has been studied on part (shape)-wise grasping which is related to fine-grained grasping and robotic affordance. Parts can be seen as atomic elements to compose an object, which contains rich semantic knowledge and a strong correlation with affordance. However, lacking a large part-wise 3D robotic dataset limits the development of part representation learning and downstream applications. In this paper, we propose a new large Language-guided SHape grAsPing datasEt (named LangSHAPE) to promote 3D part-level affordance and grasping ability learning. From the perspective of robotic cognition, we design a two-stage fine-grained robotic grasping framework (named LangPartGPD), including a novel 3D part language grounding model and a part-aware grasp pose detection model, in which explicit language input from human or large language models (LLMs) could guide a robot to generate part-level 6-DoF grasping pose with textual explanation. Our method combines the advantages of human-robot collaboration and LLMs’ planning ability using explicit language as a symbolic intermediate. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we perform 3D part grounding and fine-grained grasp detection experiments on both simulation and physical robot settings, following language instructions across different degrees of textual complexity. Results show our method achieves competitive performance in 3D geometry fine-grained grounding, object affordance inference, and 3D part-aware grasping tasks. Our dataset and code are available on our project website https://sites.google.com/view/lang-shape. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the problem of pragmatic 6 DoF robotic grasping for a robot in a real-world scenario. Different from existing work focusing on task-oriented solutions, our research attempts to consider fine-grained grasping as a general and essential modeling problem (i.e. Point 1: which part to grasp; Point 2: how to grasp the specific part). For that, our method fully considers the scalability and compatibility with subsequently developed functional modules. A two-stage loosely-coupled fine-grained grasping framework (LangPartGPD) is designed, including a 3D part language grounding model and a part-aware 6 DoF grasping pose detection model (Point 1). The former is used to link the symbolic-level grasped part representation to the specific region of an object. The latter is to realize kinematic-level grasping point generation based on the constraint of parts (Point 2). To realize the designed model, we propose a newly large-scale language-pointcloud-grasp dataset (LangSHAPE) to train fine-grained 3D part-level grounding and part-constrained grasping detection models. It is noted that our method is purely concerned with the target object, grasped part, and functionality to realize to model the essential fine-grained graspability, which is an insufficiently explored direction currently and could promote task-level grasping performance. The symbolic-level description of grasping in the form of natural language provides an explainable decision and a user-friendly interface for human-robot collaboration. Experiments in simulations and real-robot settings show our method can effectively enable a robot to make a cognitive decision for fine-grained manipulation. Summarily, our work is a preliminary exploration to link symbolic-level cognitive space to kinematic-level control space directly. In future research, we will further combine more complicated cognitive knowledge from public multimodal knowledge graphs and multimodal LLMs, to build a general robotic cognitive decision system using LangPartGPD as the basic components.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2025.3566461","Postdoctoral Fellowship Program of CPSF(grant numbers:GZC20232292); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:T2125009,92048302); “Pioneer” Research and Development Program of Zhejiang(grant numbers:2023C03007); Suzhou Key Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Social Governance Technologies(grant numbers:SZS2023007); Smart Social Governance Technology and Innovative Application Platform(grant numbers:YZCXPT2023101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10982160","Fine-grained robotic grasping;3D vision-language grounding;affordance learning;robotic cognition","Grasping;Robots;Affordances;Three-dimensional displays;Grounding;6-DOF;Solid modeling;Electronic mail;Point cloud compression;Natural languages","","1","","92","IEEE","2 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Coordination between team members is critical to mission success, especially in dynamic, time-critical environments. As highly automated agents become more prevalent, effective HAT become crucial to maintain effective coordination. This especially applies to our domain of Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T) in which manned and unmanned aircraft act as collaborative teammates, with pilots acting as integrated combat members and decision-makers. We see a clear need for design patterns that support the development of agents that meet the requirements of effective HAT. The development of these patterns focuses on MUM-T and is carried out in two steps. Firstly, we conduct a review study to identify the general behavioural patterns, coordination mechanisms, and enablers of effective teaming. Secondly, these findings are then compared with organizational paradigms from Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). The requirements for effective HAT are then used to propose a hybrid two-layer cognitive work system that can be used for MUM-T missions. The first layer of this design pattern represents the tactical planning team, where the pilot and an agent collaborate on mission planning. The second layer represents tactical execution, where agents and UAVs jointly execute this plan. To realize this two-layer approach, the architecture combines a hierarchical planning layer with a holarchical execution layer. Lastly, we discuss how this work system can be realized in a coordinated intercept MUM-T mission. The architecture is intended to support the development of cognitive agents that show high teaming capabilities in MUM-T missions and cooperatively support pilots.","","979-8-3315-2164-6","10.1109/ICHMS65439.2025.11154346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11154346","Human-Agent Teaming;Manned-Unmanned Teaming;Team Dynamics;Team Structures;Cognitive Work Systems;Multi-Agent Systems;Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","Reviews;Human-machine systems;Collaboration;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Planning;Time factors;Vehicle dynamics;Aircraft;Multi-agent systems","","","","37","IEEE","17 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This calls for a continuous planning as part of the deliberation process that makes an agent able to reconsider plans on the base of temporal constraints and changes of the environment.

The HGVF is constructed using the characteristics of different task spaces in flexible environments to enable smooth transitions between free space and contact space with adjustable operating velocity, thereby enhancing robustness against environmental interactions and uncertainties. The HGVF can attract the state trajectories of the robotic systems by path convergence of an auxiliary dynamic system, simplifying the trajectory planning process with a time-independent representation of the desired path. In addition, a neural network is employed to compensate for uncertainties in the robotic systems, while a nonlinear duffing function represents the dynamic contact force model of flexible environments. In this way, the TAATC scheme is constructed by using the HGVF and the adaptive neural network, which unifies trajectory planning and tracking control. By using the proposed TAATC scheme, the robotic systems can achieve smooth interaction with flexible environments and obtain the desired tracking force without complex trajectory planning. The stability of the HGVF and the whole control scheme are analyzed by using the Lyapunov theorem. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through both simulation and experimental tests. Note to Practitioners—The motivation of this article is that operational tasks in flexible environments are the most common for robotic systems, where the deformation and fragile nature exist widely in actual applications. The risks of overshooting, oscillations, and other harmful effects during the task execution, especially when transitioning from non-contact to contact tasks, usually degrade the control performances or even damage the flexible objects. In this article, a HGVF-based trajectory-attracted adaptive tracking control scheme is proposed for robotic systems with uncertainty operating in flexible environments. The theoretical derivation demonstrates that the proposed control scheme can attract the robotic system to track a desired trajectory and interaction with flexible environments safely, where the smooth transitioning process is achieved by using the HVGF-based time-independent control method to unify the trajectory planning and tracking control. The satisfactory control performances of the simulation and experimental tests on a robotic manipulator, which interacts with a flexible object, show the practical application on a real robotic system.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2025.3564644","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62273311,62203398); Henan Provincial Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:242300421051); Henan Province Soft Science Research Plan Project(grant numbers:252400411031); Outstanding Foreign Scientist Project in Henan Province(grant numbers:GZ2025001); Institute for Robotics of Zhengzhou University and Zhengzhou JD Cloud Computing Company Ltd; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10978092","Trajectory-attracted control;guiding vector field;robotic manipulator;neural network;flexible environments","Aerospace electronics;Trajectory;Vectors;Control systems;Trajectory planning;Switches;Force;Uncertainty;Manipulator dynamics;Automation","","","","31","IEEE","28 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address these challenges, there is a notable shift from monolithic models to compound AI systems, with the premise of more powerful, versatile, and reliable applications. However, progress thus far has been piecemeal, with proposals for agentic workflows, programming models, and extended LLM capabilities, without a clear vision of an overall architecture.

In our proposed architecture the key orchestration concept is ‘streams' to coordinate the flow of data and instructions among agents. Existing proprietary models and APIs in the enterprise are mapped to ‘agents', defined in an ‘agent registry’ that serves agent metadata and learned representations for search and planning. Agents can utilize proprietary data through a ‘data registry’ that similarly registers enterprise data of various modalities. Tying it all together, data and task ‘planners' break down, map, and optimize tasks and queries for given quality of service (QoS) requirements such as cost, accuracy, and latency.

On top of these components, a layered software architecture consisting of a decision layer, a skill layer and a functional layer is presented The proposed concept aims to be a blueprint for a unified software architecture satisfying the requirements of robotic systems to achieve deformable linear object manipulation. The validation of the software architecture is done in a case study of an autonomous shape manipulation task, where one robot and a stereo camera shape a deformable linear object to a predefined desired shape. This use case is inspired by an automated cable routing process, which today in the industry is still mainly handled manually and therefore offers a vast potential for automation.","","978-1-4503-9317-1","10.1145/3526071.3527520","German Research Foundation(grant numbers:GRK 2198/1,EXC 2075-390740016); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9814824","Software architecture;Deformable linear object;Robotic manipulation;Autonomous control","Shape;Software architecture;Service robots;Computational modeling;Wires;Computer architecture;Routing","","","","24","","11 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the requirements of measurement efficiency and precision, robots and optical scanners are applied to measure free-form surface parts increasingly. Due to the complex geometry shapes and occlusions of these parts, how to plan accessible viewpoints of a scanner to achieve the expected coverage rate is a challenging task. This paper presents a novel viewpoint planning method based on the visibility cone space explorer (VP-VCSE) for robotic measurement systems with 7 degrees of freedom (7-DOF). A digital twin for the robotic measurement system is implemented to provide core services for robotic measurement tasks, including sensor simulation and collision detection. To generate initial candidate viewpoints, a novel mesh segmentation algorithm based on the hybrid mixture model is proposed, which is convenient to handle the triangular mesh of the target object. Visibility computation for a target object in given viewpoints is the key to dealing with the occlusion problem. For this purpose, a general visibility model of a structured-light scanner is presented to compute visible areas accurately. In order to reduce occlusions, a visibility cone space explorer is designed to search optimal candidate viewpoints considering inverse kinematics and physical collisions simultaneously. The viewpoint planning problem is formulated as a set covering optimization problem and a next-best-view operator is introduced to improve the efficiency of the genetic algorithm for searching the resultant viewpoint set, guaranteeing the expected coverage rate and data overlap rate. The simulation and experiment results for four different test models show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing methods in terms of the uncovered rate and the minimum number of viewpoints. Note to Practitioners—This paper addressed a viewpoint planning problem for the robotic measurement system with a binocular structured light 3D scanner mounted on the end effector of the robot, where a robot and a turntable cooperate to complete the measurement tasks. The goal is to find a minimal number of viewpoints that provides full coverage of the target surfaces. Although many studies have addressed this problem, there is little discussion about strategies to improve coverage rate when the target object has complex occlusions. This paper suggested a valuable practice to construct a visibility cone space to adjust viewpoint to reduce occlusions and improve the overall coverage rate. Simulation and experimental results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. This paper showed how to deal with various constraints that a feasible viewpoint needs to satisfy in the viewpoint generation, viewpoint adjustment, and viewpoint selection phase. Moreover, this paper provided a solution for developing the visualization, simulation, and interaction of a digital twin for the 7-DOF robotic measurement system. All core services for robotic measurement tasks are implemented based on a set of open source libraries, which provides a convenient learning and research software platform for practitioners. In future research, we will study how to improve the intelligence and cooperation of the robotic measurement system through deep learning or reinforcement learning techniques.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2023.3308785","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62293515,62293512,62003136); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2023JJ10015); Major Project of Xiangjiang Laboratory(grant numbers:22XJ01006); Major Project of Science and Technology Innovation 2030(grant numbers:2021ZD0113100); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10239208","Viewpoint planning;sensor placement constraints;visibility cone;hybrid mixture model;robotic measurement system;digital twin","Robots;Robot sensing systems;Three-dimensional displays;Space exploration;Planning;Robot kinematics;Collision avoidance;Visualization;Digital twins","","4","","44","IEEE","4 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In an unstructured human environment, a service robot often needs to perform tasks even without human intervention and prior knowledge about tasks and environments. For autonomous execution of tasks, varied processes are necessary such as perceiving environments, representing knowledge, reasoning with the knowledge, and planning for task and motion. While developing each of the processes is important, integrating them into a working system for deployment is also important as a robotic system can bring tangible outcomes when it works in real world. However, such an architecture has been rarely realized in the literature owing to the difficulties of a full integration, deployment, understanding high-level goals without human interventions. In this work, we suggest a software architecture that integrates the components necessary to perform tasks by a real robot without human intervention. We show our architecture composed of deep learning based perception, symbolic reasoning, AI task planning, and geometric motion planning. We implement a deep neural network that produces information about the environment, which are then stored in a knowledge base. We implement a reasoner that processes the knowledge to use the result for task planning. We show our implementation of the symbolic task planner that generates a sequence of motion predicates.

The architecture uses a distributed processing model based on the “edge-fog-cloud” (EFC) concept. Edge-level robots handle real-time data collection, local decision-making, and environmental perception. Fog-level vehicles manage intermediate processing and supervision of the groups, while cloud servers perform comprehensive data analysis and long-term storage, being the higher-level hierarchy of the framework.

The framework endows a position-controlled robotic manipulator with the capability of accurate compliant motion in free space and accurate force control in motion-constrained environment. Methods: An intuitive six degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) admittance control model expressed in an arbitrary Cartesian body frame is mathematically derived with closed-form task space error mapping. Its practical implementation on widely-used collaborative manipulators is proposed to achieve full task space compliant behaviors and accurate 6-D force control. A hybrid control law is presented to achieve good motion accuracy in free space and improved coupled stability in motion-constrained environment. The coupled model of physical human-robot interaction is established and the reason for the improved coupled stability is analyzed through simulation. Results: Evaluation experiments on the proposed control framework were performed to show the effectiveness. The mean error of compliant trajectory following was less than 0.30 mm in free space. The mean relative force and moment control accuracy in three orthogonal directions was better than 0.5% and 0.8%, respectively. The improved coupled stability under the same model parameters was also confirmed by human-robot interaction experiments. Finally, an automated robotic US imaging experiment on a human volunteer in a real clinical scenario was carried out to show the potential application of our proposed framework. Conclusion: Experimental results have shown the advantages of the control framework, including satisfied force control accuracy, high accuracy of compliant motion, improved coupled stability, and system effectiveness on a human volunteer. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the increasing needs of automated ultrasound (US) scanning for both diagnostic and interventional purpose. Clinical sonographers suffer from repeated workload when performing diagnostic US imaging, which could benefit from automated robotic scanning. Robotic US imaging involves physical interaction between the robot end-effector (i.e., US transducer) and the human body. The dynamics of the interaction is regulated by the control law to guarantee the contact of the US transducer and the safety of the procedure. Most existing works have focused on regulating in-plane contact force in terms of the position without considering the compliance in other dimensions. However, it is not a trivial work to extend the positional compliance to six degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) compliance. As the prevalence of low-cost collaborative robotic arms in medical scenarios, how to perform 6-DoF compliant trajectory following and accurate six-dimensional (6-D) force control on these robotic arms becomes increasingly important. This paper gives a complete general solution to achieve 6-DoF compliant control and 6-D force regulation with accurate kinematics on a position-controlled robotic arm. A hybrid control law is proposed to switch the government of “instantaneous model” and “theoretical model” to achieve compliant motion accuracy in free space and improved coupled stability in motion-constrained environment. No expensive torque sensors and torque control interface are required. And no prior geometric knowledge about the scanning object is needed. We have demonstrated the application for robotic US imaging in a real clinical scenario.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2023.3282974","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62173014,U22A2051,82071924); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:L222105); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10148635","Robotic ultrasound;admittance control;force control;coupled stability","Robots;Force;Imaging;Robot sensing systems;Probes;Aerospace electronics;Task analysis","","17","","36","IEEE","12 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The temporal goals are described using temporal logic formulas, such as bounded linear temporal logic (LTL) and co-safe LTL to capture complex tasks. The proposed framework trains neural network (NN)-based planners that enjoy strong correctness guarantees when applying to unseen tasks, i.e., the exact task (including workspace, temporal logic formula, and errors in the dynamical models of the robot) is not available during the training of NNs. Our approach to achieving theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency is based on two insights. First, we incorporate a symbolic model into the training of NNs such that the resulting NN-based planner inherits the interpretability and correctness guarantees of the symbolic model. Moreover, the symbolic model serves as a discrete “memory,” which is necessary for satisfying temporal logic formulas. Second, we train a library of NNs offline and combine a subset of the trained NNs into a single NN-based planner at runtime when a task is revealed. In particular, we develop a novel constrained NN training procedure, named formal NN training, to enforce that each NN in the library represents a “symbol” in the symbolic model. As a result, our neurosymbolic framework enjoys the scalability and flexibility benefits of machine learning and inherits the provable guarantees from control-theoretic and formal-methods techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in both simulations and on an actual robotic vehicle and show that our framework can generalize to unseen tasks where state-of-the-art meta-reinforcement learning techniques fail.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2024.3392079","NSF(grant numbers:CNS-2002405,CNS-2013824,CNS-2313104); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10506629","Formal methods;meta-reinforcement learning;neural networks (NNs)","Artificial neural networks;Task analysis;Training;Robots;Safety;Computational modeling;Vehicle dynamics","","5","","82","IEEE","22 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An under-explored but natural next direction is to investigate LLMs as multi-robot task planners. However, long-horizon, heterogeneous multi-robot planning introduces new challenges of coordination while also pushing up against the limits of context window length.

The approach utilizes a bimanual robotic platform with a front-facing camera to guide subjects through gestures like reaching and bringing the hand to the mouth, adjusting movements based on motor and cognitive responses. Real-time vocal feedback enhances interaction, while movement parameters dynamically adapt to response time, motor performance, and task comprehension. Motor assessment combines data from the robot camera and two additional depth sensors, enabling near real-time kinematic and dynamic analysis, as well as an indirect evaluation of motor control.

Various applications like healthify me and room suggest users a diet based on their specifications like height, weight, age, gender etc. Some of these applications make use of E-mail automation to suggest users with a user-specific, specially curated diet at timed intervals(daily/weekly/monthly..). Various tools such as Automation Anywhere, Blue prism, UI-Path, Pega etc.[4] are used to create bots and automate tasks/compute algorithms. The tool used for the creation of this diet recommendation system is Automation Anywhere. By making use of automation anywhere, a recommender system is created that can act as a meal planner. There are three types of bots in Automation Anywhere – task bots, meta bots and IQ bots. Task bots need to be edited manually with application updates. Metabots on the other hand, are more advanced. They are designed in such a way that bot-recalibration is automatically applied with changes in the application interface. IQ bots use cognitive technology when working with unstructured data[11].

To address the need for lightweight and adaptive robotic grippers, a tendon-driven underactuated three-finger robotic hand with a hybrid rigid-flexible structure is proposed. First, a hybrid rigid-flexible architecture is constructed, and the tendon path layout is optimized. Then, the system's performance is validated through RRT* path planning simulation, achieving six degrees of freedom motion driven by a single motor. Finally, the lightweight design reduces the total weight to only 132 g, an 18% reduction compared to a gear-driven solution, minimizing the impact on the dynamic balance of the host robot, ROBOTIS OP3. Simulation results show that under a 0.76 kg load, the workspace volume of the robotic hand is 2.3 times larger than that of the theoretical rigid model.

However, for larger telescopes there is a technological limit for producing primary mirrors made of a single rigid piece. A similar problem arises for space-based telescopes, where the cargo areas of launch vehicles provide an upper limit for the maximum aperture of the telescope, even if it is deployable as the James Webb Space Telescope. As larger telescopes are required, in-space assembly emerges as a feasible alternative, making use of a highly autonomous robotic system that directly constructs the structure on orbit. Although this might reduce the overall costs of construction and maintenance of the structures, such robotization brings additional challenges for an automatic planning system. This paper presents the study and implementation of an autonomous assembly planner for in-space robotic assembly of telescopes using segmented mirror tiles. The proposed planner takes into consideration different constraints. On the one hand, robot physical constraints such as joint position and torque limits, and moments of inertia of the sub-assemblies must be considered. On the other hand, semantic constraints representing the possible types of connections between tiles must be specified to ensure the mechanical stability and electric and data connectivity within the structure. In order to generate a plan that considers these constraints, we propose a hybrid assembly planner with a global and a local layer. The global layer uses graph search strategies to explore a graph representation of possible assembly sequences, ensuring that the potential solutions fulfill all the semantic constraints describing the allowed connections between tiles. The local layer uses a constrained path planning algorithm combined with a dynamic simulation to ensure that the transitions between states (representing sub-assemblies) fulfill the required physical constraints. The final assembly sequence to be executed is selected by minimizing a suitable cost function. The planner is integrated into a ground-based demonstrator for autonomous robotic assembly of mirror tiles, developed within the PULSAR EU Project. Simulations for larger telescope structures demonstrate the generality of the approach. In order to illustrate the flexibility of the planner, different physical constraints and optimization goals were implemented and verified. The planner successfully adapts the assembly plan accordingly.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-7436-5","10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438399","European Union(grant numbers:821858); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9438399","","Robotic assembly;Tiles;Heuristic algorithms;Semantics;Telescopes;Planning;Trajectory","","10","","32","EU","7 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The conventional piecewise constant curvature model utilized in soft robots suffers from issues of discontinuity and singularity. These inherent drawbacks pose significant challenges when attempting to address the nonlinear problems associated with motion planning. To overcome these limitations, we establish a relationship between the length of drive cable and the coordination of robot terminal. Through the application of Taylor transformation, we effectively eliminate the control variation present in the denominator of this expression. Then, the nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) with this model expression and input mapping is proposed for motion planning. By directly constructing the current input and output of the motion planning based on the combination of previous data and substituting the linearized part of the model with this data, we mitigate the impact of model inaccuracies on the solution process. Both the obstacles and robot are modeled as polyhedra, and the collision problem is reformulated in the form of continuous nonlinear inequalities. These expressions are then incorporated into the NMPC optimization function as collision avoidance constraints. This approach enables the attainment of a larger feasible movement area and more precise tracking results during the motion planning process. Finally, experimental and simulation results conducted on a rigid-soft hybrid robot demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method, validating its effectiveness in practical applications. Note to Practitioners—This paper was developed for the motion planning of rigid-soft robots in tracking and collision-avoidance tasks. In industrial robotic arms used in manufacturing processes, it can enhance motion planning to ensure seamless part handling while avoiding collisions with surrounding equipment. For example, in automotive assembly lines, these robots need to precisely pick and place components without hitting fixtures or other robots. In service robots for indoor environments, like those used in hospitals for patient care or in warehouses for inventory management, the proposed method can be used to plan paths that avoid obstacles such as furniture, people, or stacked goods. The ability to convert collision-avoidance constraints into nonlinear continuous inequalities, treating the robot and obstacles as polyhedra, provides a larger motion range, which is crucial in these complex indoor settings.In future work, we aim to improve the algorithm efficiency and real-time performance, which will further expand the applicability of this approach in time-critical robotic applications.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2025.3582945","Shanghai Natural Science Fund Project(grant numbers:24ZR1438800); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11050936","Rigid-soft hybrid robot;nonlinear model predictive control;input mapping;motion planning;collision avoidance","Robots;Collision avoidance;Robot kinematics;Planning;Optimization;Soft robotics;Mathematical models;Manipulators;Computational modeling;Service robots","","","","26","IEEE","25 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Yet this paradigm simultaneously broadens the attack surface—extending vulnerabilities from generation into retrieval pipelines, language interfaces, and exposed APIs. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive threat taxonomy and adversarial framework targeting both conventional and agentic RAG systems, in which LLMs autonomously plan and execute multi-step tasks using retrieved knowledge. Our analysis spans a wide spectrum of adversarial techniques, including prompt injection, jailbreak exploits, API-driven model extraction, and multilingual prompt manipulation. Unlike prior work that primarily focuses on English-only vulnerabilities, we show that multilingual RAG pipelines—particularly those involving language blending (e.g., Arabic-English code-switching)—introduce novel attack vectors that bypass safety filters and induce unintended behaviors. To study these risks, we develop a multilingual adversarial benchmark suite that integrates both synthetic and real-world corpora across English, Arabic, and Spanish. Through systematic evaluation, we demonstrate how the retrieval layer not only amplifies leakage and inversion risks but also enables adversaries to infer system logic, extract private data from vector stores, and manipulate autonomous agent behavior through tool-integrated APIs. To mitigate these threats, we assess multiple defense strategies, including prompt sanitization, cross-lingual content filtering, retriever-stage anomaly detection, and behavior-based profiling of API interactions. Our findings reveal that existing safeguards are insufficient—particularly in agentic or low-resource language scenarios—underscoring the need for architecture-specific and multilingual defenses. This work fills a critical gap in GenAI security by presenting the first holistic, multilingual, and agent-aware security framework for RAG, offering actionable guidance for building robust and trustworthy generative AI applications across diverse linguistic and deployment contexts.","","979-8-3315-9406-0","10.1109/GACLM67198.2025.11231998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11231998","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG);Large Language Models (LLMs);Secure Generative AI;Agentic AI;Prompt Injection;Multilingual NLP;Multilingual Prompt Exploits;Generative AI Security;Model Extraction;Jailbreak Attacks;API Abuse;Contextual Prompt Injection;LLM Systems Defense Strategies;Trustworthy Generative AI and LLM Systems","Filters;Generative AI;Large language models;Computational modeling;Retrieval augmented generation;Pipelines;Vectors;Multilingual;Security;Context modeling","","","","17","IEEE","11 Nov 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, building the awareness of AI agents to balance the group utilities and system costs and meet group members' needs in their cooperation is a crucial problem for individuals learning to support their community and even integrate into human society in the long term.

Developing software for such robots involves the design of task planning paradigms and the implementation of robotic software architectures, making software development rather tricky and time-consuming. In recent decades, component-based software development approaches have been increasingly adopted in robotics to improve software development efficiency by reusing data and controlling flows between components. However, few works have tackled the more critical issue of reusing complex high-level task planning paradigms and robotic software architectures. To make up for the limitation, this paper first identifies the mainstream task planning paradigms and proposes a set of novel patterns for interaction pipelines between the robotic functions of sensing, planning, and acting. Then this paper presents a novel Behavior Tree (BT) based development framework Structural-BT, which provides a set of reusable BT structures that implement abstract interaction pipelines while maintaining interfaces for task-specific customization. The Structural-BT framework supports the modular design of structure functionalities and allows easy extensibility of the inner planning flows between BT components. With the Structural-BT framework, software engineers can develop robotic software by flexibly composing BT structures to formulate the skeleton software architecture and implement task-specific algorithms when necessary. In the experiment, this paper develops robotic software for diverse task scenarios and selects the baseline approaches of Robot Operating System (ROS) and classical BT development frameworks for comparison. By quantitatively measuring the reuse frequencies and ratios of BT structures, the Structural-BT framework has been shown to be more efficient than the baseline approaches for robotic software development.","2097-3705","","10.23919/CSMS.2023.0017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10347382","robotic software modeling and development;software architecture;task planning paradigm;behavior tree modeling","Software architecture;Pipelines;Robot sensing systems;Software;Planning;Sensors;Frequency measurement","","4","","31","","7 Dec 2023","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

In many application scenarios, manual assembly by astronauts is either highly cost-inefficient or not feasible at all due to orbital constraints. However, (semi-) autonomous robotic assembly systems may provide the means to construct larger structures in space in the near future. Modularity is a key concept for such structures, and also for reducing costs in novel spacecraft designs. The advantage of the modular approach lies in the capability to generate a high number of unique assets from a reduced number of building blocks. Thus, spacecrafts can be easily adapted to particular use cases, and could even be reconfigured during their lifetime using a robotic manipulation system. These ideas lie at the core of our current EU project MOSAR (MOdular Spacecraft Assembly and Reconfiguration). Teleoperating a space robotic system from Earth to assemble a modular structure is not straightforward. Major difficulties are related to time delays, communication losses, limited control modalities, and low immersion for the operator. Autonomous robotic operations are then preferred, and with this goal we propose a fully autonomous system for planning in-space assembly tasks. Our system is able to generate assembly and reconfiguration plans for modular structures in terms of high-level actions that can autonomously be executed by a robot. Through multiple simulation layers, the system automatically verifies the feasibility and correctness of action sequences created by the planner. The layers implement different levels of abstraction, hierarchically stacked to detect infeasible transitions and initiate replanning at an early stage. Levels of abstraction increase in complexity, ranging from a basic geometric description of the spacecraft, over kinematics of the robotic setup, to full representations of the actions. The system reuses information from failed checks in all layers to avoid similar situations during replanning. We use a hybrid approach where symbolic reasoning is combined with considerations of physical constraints to generate a holistic sequence of actions. We demonstrate our planner for large space structures in a simulation environment. In particular, we consider the reconfiguration of a given modular structure, i.e. disassemble parts and reassemble them in a new configuration. The adaptability of our planning system is shown by executing the assembly plans on robots with different sets of skills and in scenarios with simulated hardware failures.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-7436-5","10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438257","DLR; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9438257","","Space vehicles;Robotic assembly;Manuals;Kinematics;Telescopes;Orbits;Planning","","15","","24","IEEE","7 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The combination of cloud computing and edge computing integrates into a heterogeneous network that combines both. This network architecture leverages the complementary strengths of cloud and edge computing, maximizing their advantages while minimizing their weaknesses. The cloud utilizes its powerful computing and storage capabilities to provide flexible configurations, low latency, and high bandwidth network environments for edge devices. This paper employs principal component analysis to address the large amount of data generated in cloud-fog hybrid management systems and conducts dynamic analysis for resource allocation strategies. The principal component analysis algorithm extracts both dynamic and static features of the data, revealing hidden patterns within it. After analysis, this enhances understanding of the data and constructs a feature-based principal component model that adapts to changes in the cloud-fog environment. This model can also adjust the allocation plan of the cloud-fog hybrid system in real-time based on current system resource status, leading to more efficient resource utilization. Compared with the traditional data allocation strategy, the strategy proposed in this study has significant advantages in improving the system response speed, saving network bandwidth, and enhancing the organization efficiency of the related devices, which can balance the computational power demand of IoT data processing more efficiently.","","978-1-6654-7787-1","10.1109/ICETIS66286.2025.11143991","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11143991","PCA;Cloud-fog hybrid management;Resource allocation","Cloud computing;Adaptation models;Heuristic algorithms;Computational modeling;Bandwidth;Dynamic scheduling;Feature extraction;Data models;Resource management;Principal component analysis","","","","18","IEEE","5 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve this goal, a path-planning methodology that leverages system observability is exploited for a quadrotor. This path-planning method is underpinned by the eigenvalues of the Gramian matrix, which are used as a measure of system observability degree, to increase the precision of the quadrotor’s estimated position. In SLAM, high accuracy in the quadrotor’s state estimation improves the accuracy of the map landmarks position estimation. To enhance the accuracy and fortify system robustness, implementing a centralized distributed architecture within a group of three quadrotors is advocated. In this setup, the role of a central hub for information fusion from all agents and determining the most observable path for the entire group is assigned to the leader quadrotor. An assessment of the proposed path-planning method against a random path-planning approach within a single-agent architecture is conducted across various scenarios. This evaluation compares the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the quadrotor’s state estimation. The results illustrate a notable improvement in accuracy. Furthermore, a comparison is conducted to assess the performance of the multi-agent architecture in contrast to the single-agent architecture using the proposed method.

The possible occurrence of information incompleteness during robot plan execution expects the robot to sense the environment and obtain the missing information actively. A set of planning and reasoning approaches has focused on robotic tasks in incomplete domains. However, the sensing action operators are generally abstracted as passively receiving sensory information and formulating a finite set of observations. The strict constraint of solely sensing without actively acting on the environment greatly reduces the chances of revealing more hidden information. This letter proposes a novel observation plan that couples an atomic sensing action with parallel actuating effects, and an adjoint observation scheme for actively run-time information gathering. To concretely realize the adjoint observation scheme, we present a Hybrid-ASP planning approach that integrates a deterministic task planner for generating an initially valid task plan for task achievement and a logic-based Answer Set Planner to make observation plans.

The classic Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is designed for particles with no mass or physical dimensions unlike differential robots. Therefore, it cannot be directly used to search for a goal using a robotic swarm. We propose the use of the PSO as a trajectory planner to enable the agents to collectively find the optimal path to a goal. The proposed PSO trajectory planner uses multiple known parameters such as inertia weight, a constriction parameter, two scaling factors and two random weighing factors (for the cognitive and social components of the PSO) optimized for differential robots. The planner takes into account the restrictions derived from the kinematic equations of the robotic agents and the finite dimensions of the search space. For that purpose, it is coupled with the necessary controllers to map particle velocities into smooth and continuous differential robot velocities. Four different controllers were tested, including the Transformed Unicycle Controller (TUC), Transformed Unicycle with LQR (TUC-LQR), Transformed Unicycle with LQI (TUC-QI), and a Lyapunov-stable Pose Controller (LSPC). The TUC-LQI controller outperformed the others in terms of achieving smooth continuous differential robot velocities, while following the paths generated by the PSO trajectory planner.","","978-1-7281-2547-3","10.1109/SSCI47803.2020.9308498","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9308498","PSO;Trajectory planner;Differential robots","Robots;Robot kinematics;Trajectory;Kinematics;Mobile robots;Actuators;Wheels","","4","","21","IEEE","5 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most existing methods focus on teaching short, isolated skills rather than long, multistep tasks. To bridge this gap, imitation learning algorithms must not only learn individual skills but also an abstract understanding of how to sequence these skills to perform extended tasks effectively. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a neuro-symbolic imitation learning framework. Using task demonstrations, the system first learns a symbolic representation that abstracts the low-level state-action space. The learned representation decomposes a task into easier subtasks and allows the system to leverage symbolic planning to generate abstract plans. Subsequently, the system utilizes this task decomposition to learn a set of neural skills capable of refining abstract plans into actionable robot commands. Experimental results in three simulated robotic environments demonstrate that, compared to baselines, our neuro-symbolic approach increases data efficiency, improves generalization capabilities, and facilitates interpretability.","","979-8-3315-4139-2","10.1109/ICRA55743.2025.11127692","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11127692","","Bridges;Imitation learning;Education;Refining;Multitasking;Planning;Robots","","","","61","IEEE","2 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we propose a novel system that is designed to discover symbolic action primitives along with perceptual symbols autonomously. Our system is based on an encoder-decoder structure with a bottleneck layer with discrete activation that takes object and action information as input and predicts the generated effect. To efficiently explore the vast continuous action parameter space, we introduce a Curiosity-Based exploration module that selects the most informative actions—the ones that maximize the entropy in the predicted effect distribution. The discovered symbolic action primitives are then used to make plans using a symbolic tree search strategy in single- and double-object manipulation tasks. We compare our model with two baselines that use different exploration strategies in different experiments. The results show that our approach can learn a diverse set of symbolic action primitives, which are effective for generating plans in order to achieve given manipulation goals.","","979-8-3315-4343-3","10.1109/ICDL63968.2025.11204386","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11204386","","Training;Hands;Translation;Symbols;Predictive models;Gaussian distribution;Search problems;Entropy;Planning;Robots","","","","26","IEEE","21 Oct 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Tomatoes, being predominantly selfpollinated, depend on airflow to transfer pollen from the anther to the stigma within the flower. In isolated environments like greenhouses, ensuring effective air pollination presents a significant challenge. Due to limited natural airflow, greenhouses often rely on mechanical ventilation systems which cannot adequately replicate the natural pollination process. In this work, a low-cost but efficient autonomous pollination system is developed for tomato plants in greenhouses that utilize both deep learning capability as well as robotic hardware manipulation. The deep learning model is based on the YOLOv8 Nano architecture that is customized with a transformer module which achieved an mAP@50 score of $\mathbf{9 4. 6}$ percent for mature flower detection. Explainable AI (XAI) like EigenCAM and XGrad-CAM approach showed correct visualization over the flower area with minimum noise. The developed model was implemented on the Nvidia Jetson Nano where the Bot-SORT tracking algorithm was used to avoid over-pollination of the same flower. For real-time application, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) app was developed which functioned together with the hardware system using closed-loop feedback control on a pan-tilt mechanism for targeting each mature tomato flower.

This paper proposes a multi-agent collaborative closed-loop planning-evaluation framework, an LLM-driven, closed-loop optimization pipeline for task planning and feasibility auditing aimed at robust planning in complex, dynamic settings. The framework adopts a layered architecture with three LLM-based agents: a planning agent, an evaluation (validation) agent, and an assessment agent. Using a unified geometric-semantic-constraint representation, the planner generates symbolic task sequences, maps them to a predefined skill library, and performs self-checks to revise plans. The evaluation agent audits plans against preset criteria, outputs feasibility judgments and corrective suggestions, and iterates with the planner until a feasible solution is obtained. A fine-tuned assessment agent produces quantitative scores by combining task completion, efficiency, and replanning penalties, forming a human preference-aligned evaluation system.

It aims to address three major technical bottlenecks commonly faced by traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches in path planning applications: the challenge of non-stationarity caused by dynamic environments, the difficulty of coordinated policy optimization among agents, and the inefficiency of the training process. By systematically analyzing the core features of the MADDPG algorithm-such as its distinctive centralized training with decentralized execution framework, gradient variance suppression mechanism, and adaptability to diverse scenarios-this research establishes two key optimization pathways. In terms of technological innovation, the study achieves dual breakthroughs. First, by incorporating the LSTM neural network architecture, it significantly enhances agents' ability to capture temporal dynamics, enabling a more accurate understanding of environmental evolution. Second, it introduces a progressive curriculum learning paradigm, implementing a staged task difficulty strategy that effectively refines the agents' learning trajectory. Empirical results demonstrate that the optimized algorithm exhibits outstanding performance in multi-agent path planning tasks. A high-fidelity simulation testbed with three heterogeneous agents was developed, and extensive comparative experiments confirmed the superiority of the proposed method. Experimental data show notable improvements across several key performance metrics: the task planning success rate increased to 95.12%, the average path length was reduced by 0.8 meters compared to baseline methods, and the average navigation time was shortened to 10.4 seconds-all significantly outperforming existing approaches. To further validate the algorithm's performance, the research team conducted a quantitative analysis using agent position heatmaps, which vividly illustrated the enhanced rationality of path planning and the improved environmental adaptability offered by the proposed algorithm.","","979-8-3315-2284-1","10.1109/ICIPCA65645.2025.11138984","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11138984","Reinforcement Learning;Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning;Path Planning;LSTM;Reward Function","Training;Meters;Learning systems;Technological innovation;Navigation;Heuristic algorithms;Reinforcement learning;Trajectory;Long short term memory;Optimization","","","","22","IEEE","5 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Meanwhile, LLM-based approaches, which are grounded in artificial neural networks, offer faster inference and commonsense reasoning but suffer from lower success rates. To address the limitations of the current symbolic (slow speed) or LLM-based approaches (low accuracy), we propose a novel neuro-symbolic task planner that decomposes complex tasks into subgoals using LLM and carries out task planning for each subgoal using either symbolic or MCTS-based LLM planners, depending on the subgoal complexity. This decomposition reduces planning time and improves success rates by narrowing the search space and enabling LLMs to focus on more manageable tasks. Our method significantly reduces planning time while maintaining high success rates across three task planning domains, as well as real-world and simulated robotics environments.

Utilizing a Multi-Agent System (MAS) framework, this architecture incorporates various bio-inspired mechanisms tailored to specific tasks, enabling UAVs to observe and respond independently to the actions of neighboring agents. This decentralized approach promotes effective cooperation without centralized control, employing evolutionary rules for dynamic adaptation. The architecture comprises a three-tier framework that manages capability transfer and decomposition, integrating both bottom-up and top-down methodologies. This structure aligns operational requirements with logical architecture rules and supports the definition of state machines for UAV agents. Inspired by biological swarms such as birds, ants, and wolves, the UAV control rules are designed based on the agent structure of the UAVs to guide swarm behavior in different scenarios. Simulations in a virtual environment demonstrate the swarm's capability to autonomously execute ‘search and firefighting’ missions. The results, analyzed using flight mission planning software, confirm the feasibility of the adaptive formation strategy and validate the generated flight trajectories against mission constraints. The primary innovations of this study include the development of a decentralized decision-making process for UAVs, simulating real unmanned systems' decision modes, such as path planning and cooperative tactics. Furthermore, the use of multi-agent software in constructing virtual mission scenarios facilitates concept verification and supports enhanced simulations with actual aerial vehicles, bridging the gap between theoretical models and practical applications.","2771-7372","979-8-3503-8418-5","10.1109/ICUS61736.2024.10840152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10840152","Bio-Inspired Formation;Architecture;Multi-Agents","Adaptation models;Autonomous systems;Biological system modeling;Atmospheric modeling;Decision making;Virtual environments;Computer architecture;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Software;Vehicle dynamics","","","","21","IEEE","22 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previously, a deep neural network with PointNet-like architecture was trained to segment plant organelle using 3D point cloud data, allowing for structure identification and monitoring capabilities. However, enabling autonomous plant harvesting remains a challenge.

Thanks to sensors and machine learning algorithms, it is possible to gather information on the state of health of individual seedlings, fruits controlling the injection of nutrients, water and plat protection products within hydroponic greenhouse taking also into account energy efficiency in the design of new control loops for automation in this domain. In this article, we present the architectural proposal of a robotic handling system designed to optimize the positioning of the seeds inside a domestic hydroponic greenhouse, aiming to achieve an automatic and more precise seedlings process. The main contribution of the article is to highlight the relevance on obtaining the optimal positioning of seeds for future growth of plants in the controlled environment. In our case, tomato seeds were considered with the aim of obtaining a homogeneous growth of all the seedlings in the context of a highly optimized artificial environment composed by sensors, actuators, LED lighting, etc and where artificial intelligence techniques will be used for the detection, counting, identifying of tomato seedlings, estimating their precise position in the plant germinator. The architecture involves the use of a robotic arm and a video camera with embedded hardware acceleration used for deep neural network classification.

Traditional machine learning approaches, such as graph neural networks and recurrent neural networks, have achieved notable progress but often struggle to integrate rich textual context and provide interpretable reasoning. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities across diverse tasks, including text generation, code synthesis, and complex multimodal reasoning, making them promising candidates for event prediction in dynamic, data-rich environments. This research presents an agentic reasoning framework combining temporal knowledge graphs, large language models (LLMs), and a modular tool-based architecture to address event extrapolation in complex, real-world settings. The methodology integrates agent-based reasoning, iterative tool invocation, and explicit validation mechanisms to ensure logical consistency and transparency in predictions. Experiments on country-specific subsets of the POLECAT dataset employ multiple LLM architectures and multiple evaluation metrics, including Hit@k, MRR, F1-scores and Prediction Entropy. Comparative analyses demonstrate that the agentic framework achieves robust predictive performance and interpretability, complementing fine-tuned LLM baselines. Furthermore, the ethical implications of deploying AI in social computing are addressed, including bias, transparency, and accountability. This study advances event prediction by demonstrating how agentic LLMs, equipped with explicit reasoning and validation, provide scalable and ethically grounded solutions for complex social event extrapolation.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3612015","DOD Department of the Army (DA)(grant numbers:W911NF2410189); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11173644","Agentic workflows;event extrapolation;prediction;large language models (LLMs);reasoning;temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs)","Cognition;Knowledge graphs;Forecasting;Extrapolation;Predictive models;Large language models;Time series analysis;Retrieval augmented generation;History;Computer architecture","","","","52","CCBY","19 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It has been recently extended in order to handle also set-based control objectives or inequality constraints. As any local motion planner it is prone to the occurrence of local minima. This work further extends set-based inverse kinematics by adding a motion planner in order to avoid such occurrence. Motion planners are usually computationally heavy especially in their eventual implementation with a task-priority architecture. To reduce this issue, the planner is implemented as a sampling-based algorithm which works in the reduced-dimensionality of the robot workspace applying Cartesian constraints only. The output trajectory is then checked against the inverse kinematics algorithm exploiting the redundancy and verifying the fulfillment of the joint-based task constraints. During the motion, inverse kinematics is then used also in real-time to ensure a reactive behavior to address, e.g., mismatch between the a-priori information and real-time perception acquisition. Also, the motion planner runs in background to adapt to changes in the environment or to accommodate incremental mapping. Comparison with alternative approaches are investigated and discussed. The most promising method is validated first in hundreds of numerical simulations to provide a solid statistical analysis and then experimentally with a Kinova Jaco2 7 DOFs manipulator equipped with an RGB-D sensor. Note to Practitioners—In this work we propose a motion planning algorithm that allows to effectively deploy robot manipulators in partially unstructured environments. It is structured in two layers: a Cartesian space global planner guarantees the feasibility of the trajectory with respect to potential obstacles in the environment, while a reactive local planner checks the feasibility at joint level. This architecture allows to define all the safety constraints both at Cartesian and joint space needed to operate in unstructured environments, while keeping the computation time lower with respect to standard approaches that define all the constraints in an offline global planner. The reduced computation time allows to effectively perform real-time replanning operations when needed, making the robotic system capable of adapting to a dynamic environment and suitable for sharing its workspace with human operators.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2022.3178266","H2020-Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Project A Collaborative Paradigm for Human Workers and Multi-Robot Teams in Precision Agriculture Systems (CANOPIES)-A Collaborative Paradigm for Human Workers and Multi-Robot Teams in Precision Agriculture Systems(grant numbers:101016906); Programma Operativo Regionale; Fondo Sociale Europeo (PRO FSE) LAZIO 2014–2020(grant numbers:DE G06374/2021); Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca (MIUR) Program “Dipartimenti di Eccellenza 2018–2022” granted to Department Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica e dell’Informazione (DIEI), University of Cassino and Southern Lazio; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793725","Path planning;motion planning;set-based task priority inverse kinematics;redundant robots","Task analysis;Robots;Trajectory;Kinematics;Real-time systems;Planning;Dynamics","","13","","46","IEEE","10 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A handover is a collaborative joint action, where an agent, the giver, gives an object to another agent, the receiver. The physical exchange starts when the receiver first contacts the object held by the giver and ends when the giver fully releases the object to the receiver. However, important cognitive and physical processes begin before the physical exchange, including initiating implicit agreement with respect to the location and timing of the exchange. From this perspective, we structure our review into the two main phases delimited by the aforementioned events: a prehandover phase and the physical exchange. We focus our analysis on the two actors (giver and receiver) and report the state of the art of robotic givers (robot-to-human handovers) and the robotic receivers (human-to-robot handovers). We report a comprehensive list of qualitative and quantitative metrics commonly used to assess the interaction. While focusing our review on the cognitive level (e.g., prediction, perception, motion planning, and learning) and the physical level (e.g., motion, grasping, and grip release) of the handover, we also discuss safety. We compare the behaviors displayed during human-to-human handovers to the state of the art of robotic assistants and identify the major areas of improvement for robotic assistants to reach performance comparable to human interactions.

This paper proposes a novel Agentic AI-driven OSINT framework that enables autonomous information gathering, reasoning, and tool orchestration across heterogeneous open-source data streams. The system uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive agent planning to determine which tools to invoke, how to process intermediate outputs, and when to escalate findings for human review. The proposed architecture includes modules for multi-source data ingestion, LLM-powered analysis, generative scenario simulation, and ethical safeguard enforcement.

Non-holonomic systems introduce significant challenges in motion planning and control due to their kinematic constraints. The proposed approach integrates graph-based path planning with trajectory optimization and employs both nonlinear control and model predictive control (MPC) for accurate trajectory tracking. The kinematic model of a unicycle-type robot is utilized, and two path planners Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM) and Hybrid A* are evaluated, with Hybrid A* selected for its ability to generate kinematically feasible paths. Trajectory optimization is formulated as a nonlinear optimal control problem, solved using direct single-shooting and multiple-shooting methods, with the latter proving more robust. A quadratic cost function penalizes state and input deviations while enforcing obstacle avoidance through geometric constraints. For trajectory tracking, a nonlinear feedback controller and an MPC-based approach are implemented and compared. Simulation results demonstrate that the nonlinear controller achieves precise tracking, while MPC exhibits robustness with slight oscillations in heading angle regulation. The study concludes that combining optimization-based trajectory planning with advanced control strategies ensures stable and efficient navigation for non-holonomic robots in constrained environments.","","978-1-83724-702-8","10.1049/icp.2025.2737","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11143081","","","","","","","","28 Aug 2025","","","IET","IET Conferences"

To take the localization constraints into account, in this paper, we consider a heterogeneous robotic system consisting of two types of agents: anchor agents with accurate localization capability and auxiliary agents with low localization accuracy. To localize itself, the auxiliary agents must be within the communication range of an anchor, directly or indirectly. The robotic team’s objective is to minimize environmental uncertainty through persistent monitoring. We propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) based architecture with graph convolution called Graph Localized Proximal Policy Optimization (GALOPP), which incorporates the limited sensor field-of-view, communication, and localization constraints of the agents along with persistent monitoring objectives to determine motion policies for each agent. We evaluate the performance of GALOPP on open maps with obstacles having a different number of anchor and auxiliary agents. We further study 1) the effect of communication range, obstacle density, and sensing range on the performance and 2) compare the performance of GALOPP with area partition, greedy search, random search, and random search with communication constraint strategies. For its generalization capability, we also evaluated GALOPP in two different environments– 2-room and 4-room. The results show that GALOPP learns the policies and monitors the area well. As a proof-of-concept, we perform hardware experiments to demonstrate the performance of GALOPP. Note to Practitioners—Persistent monitoring is performed in various applications like search and rescue, border patrol, wildlife monitoring, etc. Typically, these applications are large-scale, and hence using a multi-robot system helps achieve the mission objectives effectively. Often, the robots are subject to limited sensing range and communication range, and they may need to operate in GPS-denied areas. In such scenarios, developing motion planning policies for the robots is difficult. Due to the lack of GPS, alternative localization mechanisms, like SLAM, high-accurate INS, UWB radio, etc. are essential. Having SLAM or a highly accurate INS system is expensive, and hence we use agents having a combination of expensive, accurate localization systems (anchor agents) and low-cost INS systems (auxiliary agents) whose localization can be made accurate using cooperative localization techniques. To determine efficient motion policies, we use a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning technique (GALOPP) that takes the heterogeneity in the vehicle localization capability, limited sensing, and communication constraints into account. GALOPP is evaluated using simulations and compared with baselines like random search, random search with ensured communication, greedy search, and area partitioning. The results show that GALOPP outperforms the baselines. The GALOPP approach offers a generic solution that be adopted with various other applications.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2024.3385412","Prime Minister Research Fellowship (PMRF); NSF(grant numbers:1943368); ONR(grant numbers:N00014-18-1-2829); Amazon Research Award; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10494985","Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL);persistent monitoring (PM);graph neural networks","Monitoring;Location awareness;Robot sensing systems;Sensors;Surveillance;Uncertainty;Deep reinforcement learning","","14","","44","IEEE","8 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Robots can move from one location to another according to a plan and have a good understanding of the environment to perform their assigned tasks. Robot movements are based on motion planning and control algorithms. This paper proposes a new hybrid motion planning and control algorithm called FAStep-Kinematic (Stepping Ahead Firefly algorithm and Kinematic equations). This algorithm includes the Firefly Stepping Ahead algorithm to avoid obstacles, the equation of motion to control the movement of the robot, and a method to detect obstacles. The algorithm starts with the equation of motion and switches to the stepping ahead firefly algorithm when an obstacle is detected. The stepping ahead firefly algorithm then plans the robot’s next step to avoid obstacles. The robot moves to this step. This procedure is repeated until the robot successfully avoids an obstacle and reaches its target. The obstacles used in this article are static and are known to robots. The hybrid algorithm will be used to navigate robots in a cluttered environment. The new algorithm’s effectiveness will be seen with an application to tractor-trailer robotic systems. The results show that the robots are able to reach their destination safely and using a shorter route. Additionally, this research compared the new hybrid algorithm’s performance with that of the ACO-Kinematic (Ant Colony Optimization and Kinematic equations) algorithm in terms of path length and convergence time. The analysis show that the hybrid algorithm is superior to the ACO-Kinematic algorithm. The proposed algorithm improves the path length by 0.37%, 9.22%, and 5.79% compared to the ACO-Kinematic algorithm in three different scenarios.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3380004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10477342","Robot;motion;control;optimization;algorithm","Robots;Heuristic algorithms;Robot kinematics;Mathematical models;Kinematics;Collision avoidance;Planning;Robot motion;Optimization methods;Algorithm design and analysis","","2","","49","CCBYNCND","21 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Performing autonomous coverage using a single robot system consumes time and energy. In particular, 3D large structures might contain some complex and occluded areas that shall be scanned rapidly in certain application domains. In this paper, a new Hybrid Coverage Path Planning (HCPP) approach is proposed to explore and cover unknown 3D large structures using a decentralized multi-robot system. The HCPP approach combines a guided Next Best View (NBV) approach with a developed Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) waypoint prediction approach to decrease the CPP exploration time at each iteration and simultaneously achieve high coverage. The hybrid approach is the new ML paradigm which fosters intelligence by balancing between data efficiency and generality allowing the exchange of some CPP parts with a learned model. The HCPP uses a stateful LSTM network architecture which is trained based on collected paths that cover different 3D structures to predict the next viewpoint. This architecture captures the dynamic dependencies of adjacent viewpoints in the long term sequences like the coverage paths. The HCPP switches between these methods triggered by either the number of iterations or an entropy threshold. In the decentralized multi-robot system, the proposed HCPP is embedded in each robot where each one of them shares its global 3D map ensuring robustness. The results performed in a realistic Gazebo robotic simulator confirmed the advantage of the proposed HCPP approach by achieving high coverage on different 3D unknown structures in a shorter time compared to conventional NBV.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3139080","Khalifa University of Science and Technology(grant numbers:RC1-2018-KUCARS); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9664539","Autonomous exploration;multi-robot;coverage planning;LSTM;path prediction;3D reconstruction","Robots;Three-dimensional displays;Long short term memory;Multi-robot systems;Solid modeling;Robot sensing systems;Planning","","17","","50","CCBYNCND","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A crucial component of the circa 2023 baseline design for the missions was the transfer of sample tubes from the Martian surface to the ascent vehicle, which requires a highly dexterous robotic arm and sophisticated control strategies. Development and testing of the control algorithms were underway at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on advanced R&D testbeds, while the ESA is responsible for delivering the flight robotic arm. To meet the complex requirements for transferring the sample tubes, we propose an abstract layer consisting of three important robotics capabilities, each to be implemented for the first time in planetary exploration. 1. 7-DoF Manipulation: This capability focuses on managing the kinematics of the 7-DoF robotic arm. It includes the development of algorithms for forward and inverse kinematics, joint redundancy management, kinematic calibration, deflection compensation, target-to-pose selection, trajectory generation, and control strategies for single-joint, multi-joint, Cartesian motions, and free-space closed-loop control. 2. Robotics Vision: This capability pertains to a monocular vision system mounted on the robotic arm's end-effector with an additional redundant camera. These cameras are essential for localizing the Mars 2020 rover (M2020) tube-retrieval station, the SRL OS, identifying tubes on the Martian surface, and estimating the robotic arm's pose to ensure successful interactions with the station. 3. In-Contact Manipulation: This capability addresses the robot's interaction with its external environment. It involves load estimation using a 6-DoF force-torque sensor, force regulation (standard load-wrench control to a setpoint), and hybrid motion (force regulation orthogonal to a baseline velocity).

Accurately forecasting pedestrian movements in dynamic and crowded environments is challenging due to factors such as unpredictable motion patterns, occlusions, missed detections, and identity switches. In this paper, we explore deep learning-based approaches for multi-frame pedestrian trajectory prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network–GRU (CNN-GRU) model. Although the CNN-GRU architecture is a known combination, our contribution lies in its practical deployment on detection- and tracking-based trajectories, generated using BoT-SORT tracking over YOLOv11 detections, and its comprehensive evaluation across three challenging benchmark datasets: MOT16, MOT17, and MOT20. The models take past trajectory sequences as input and predict future pedestrian positions, with performance measured using Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE). Experimental results demonstrate that the CNN-GRU model outperforms standalone recurrent models by effectively capturing spatial and temporal dependencies while remaining computationally efficient and suitable for real-time applications.

Besides, existing methods rely on accurate system models that are not easily scalable for large integrated power grids. In this paper, a data-driven multi-agent framework based on a deep-reinforcement-learning algorithm is proposed to overcome the computation and scalability concerns related to precise system models and to plan for the deployment of shunts for power system resilience enhancement. Specifically, voltage violations due to outages of multiple lines during windstorms are taken as an example of a power system resilience improvement problem. Then, a multi-agent based hybrid soft actor critic (HSAC) algorithm is developed for offline siting and sizing as well as online controlling of shunt reactive power compensators to enhance voltage resilience. The HSAC algorithm is derived from the fundamental SAC algorithms that contain both continuous and discrete action spaces. The proposed multi-agent framework learns from previous experiences and eventually gets trained to determine proper locations and sizes for shunts to avoid voltage violations during multiple line failures. The proposed approach is demonstrated on the IEEE 57-bus and IEEE 300-bus systems. The results show that the proposed multi-agent framework is effective for installation planning and controlling of shunts to enhance power system resilience.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2021.3078446","National Science Foundation; NSF(grant numbers:1847578,TPWRS-01593-2020.R2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9427147","Deep reinforcement learning;hybrid soft actor critic;multi-agent framework;power system resilience;shunt reactive power compensators;voltage control","Resilience;Voltage control;Power system stability;Deep learning;Reinforcement learning;Multi-agent systems;Reactive power","","98","","35","IEEE","10 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we present component analysis, preliminary experimental results, and system designs for a novel lunar transportation system, FLOAT (Flexible Levitation on a Track), that leverages diamagnetically levitated robots. Unlike current lunar robot concepts that use wheels (SEV, RASSOR), legs (Spidernaut), or hybrid wheels-on-legs for mobility, FLOAT robots are solid-state (no motors, gearboxes, or other moving parts) and consist only of permanent magnets connected in planar arrays levitating to minimize lunar dust abrasion / wear over a flexible PCB track that generates electromagnetic thrust. Results show that FLOAT robots can maintain extremely low power requirements over a range of terrains – using <5 W/m2 or <0.15 W/kg to carry up to 30 kg/m2 payload on tracks with slopes <40° and curves >5 m in-plane radius or >25 m out-of-plane radius – and use 10-100x less power for transport than wheeled vehicles.

While various vertical applications of surgical robots offer different levels of autonomy, from complete human control to reduced levels of human input for a limited range of surgical tasks, the applications of spine surgical robots still remain at an infancy stage. Big players such as Medtronic Mazor X Stealth Edition and Globus ExcelsiousGPS mainly focus on the navigation and imaging system. Although most companies are actively exploring the possibilities of automating part or all tasks during a spine procedure, few companies have realized that at clinical or commercial stage. Vista Robotics is one of the few close to enabling automation in specific tasks during a spine surgery at the clinical stage, such as discectomy and endplate preparation. The paper explains from theoretical, product development and clinical aspects how certain artificial intelligence applications on active robotic assisted spine surgery are being realized at development and clinical stages. Applications include but are not limited to: automated discectomy and endplate preparation, self-regulated intra-operative navigation, AI-enhanced preoperative surgical planning, automated endoscopic decompression, automated laminectomy. The paper further explores potential hurdles and dilemmas companies face in turning theories into products and reality.Objective: Among all different applications of AI and automation in spine surgeries, this paper focuses on the development of semi-automated handheld device and automated robotic system to achieve discectomy and endplate preparation in MIS TLIF. We developed a robotic system to automate discectomy and endplate preparation phases in order to reduce the time of surgery, to increase the volume of bone graft delivery, to optimize the quality of discectomy and endplate preparation and potentially to achieve better clinical outcomes.Methods and Tools: SpineNova includes both hand-held semi-automated discectomy and endplate preparation device, and an active robotic assisted spine system automating this procedure. The system includes hardware and software architecture, software algorithm and selfregulated navigation of the discectomy and endplate preparationResults: Numerous lab tests on cow discs demonstrate consistent improvements, including reduction in surgery time, increased volume of tissue removal, reproducibility and repeatability, and reduction in operator fatigue, etc.Conclusion: The SpineNova robotic system and the handheld device are at the pre-clinical stage and close to the commercial stage. Lab tests demonstrated positive feedback, including but not limited to increased volume of tissue removal, significant time saving from 30 minutes down to 3-4 minutes, and reproducible and consistent results in consecutively multiple lab tests, better in the robotic system than the hand-held device.

The model assumes that to solve a joint task, such as pressing together a red or blue button, two (or more) agents engage in a process of interactive inference. Each agent maintains probabilistic beliefs about the joint goal (e.g., Should we press the red or blue button?) and updates them by observing the other agent’s movements, while in turn selecting movements that make his own intentions legible and easy to infer by the other agent (i.e., sensorimotor communication). Over time, the interactive inference aligns both the beliefs and the behavioral strategies of the agents, hence ensuring the success of the joint action. We exemplify the functioning of the model in two simulations. The first simulation illustrates a “leaderless” joint action. It shows that when two agents lack a strong preference about their joint task goal, they jointly infer it by observing each other’s movements. In turn, this helps the interactive alignment of their beliefs and behavioral strategies. The second simulation illustrates a “leader–follower” joint action. It shows that when one agent (“leader”) knows the true joint goal, it uses sensorimotor communication to help the other agent (“follower”) infer it, even if doing this requires selecting a more costly individual plan. These simulations illustrate that interactive inference supports successful multi-agent joint actions and reproduces key cognitive and behavioral dynamics of “leaderless” and “leader–follower” joint actions observed in human–human experiments. In sum, interactive inference provides a cognitively inspired, formal framework to realize cooperative joint actions and consensus in multi-agent systems.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2023.3312585","MUR–PRIN2020(grant numbers:2020529PCP); EU Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation through Human Brain Project SGA3 under the Specific(grant numbers:945539); TAILOR(grant numbers:952215); European Research Council through ThinkAhead(grant numbers:820213); PNRR MUR(grant numbers:PE0000013-FAIR,IR00011-EBRAINS-Italy); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10288543","Active inference;consensus;joint action;multiagent systems (MASs);sensorimotor communication;shared knowledge;social interaction","Task analysis;Behavioral sciences;Probabilistic logic;Multi-agent systems;Probability distribution;Computational modeling","","13","","73","CCBYNCND","20 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Complex characteristics and correlations in natural phenomena make it challenging to establish a reliable framework for mobile sensing and field mapping. Furthermore, constraints of onboard resources will limit the ability of mobile robots to cover a large area. This article focuses on the active sensing problem in environmental field mapping and particularly exploits the use of intrinsic interactions among multivariate spatiotemporal data. A novel deep neural network of a hybrid CNN-RNN model is employed to learn the monitored multivariate spatiotemporal field. Specifically, a set of attention mechanisms is designed and embedded in the network, which is able to adaptively capture parameterwise dependencies among the monitored heterogeneous parameters and spatial correlations in geolocations of a surveyed field. The weights of inferred attention facilitate explicit interpretation of the driving parameters and geolocations. Some subregions of interest in the surveyed field are specified by their spatial attention distribution and are actively sensed by following the proposed coverage path planner. Experiments are carried out using a real-world dataset with multisource environmental imagery from a remote sensing program. Experimental results are obtained, which demonstrate the superior mapping performance of the proposed systematical methodology compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, the proposed model is able to quantitatively reveal the driving monitored parameters and geolocations in a regression process. Note to Practitioners—This article was motivated by the need for a practical and systematic approach for reconstruction and planning to execute robotic active sensing (AS) in environmental field mapping. Field robotic applications are not maneuverable in comparison with indoor scenarios due to severe conflict between the need for long execution endurance in the field and the very limited onboard resources. Traditional AS planners normally use statistical model-based informative metrics, which may lead to model misspecification in real-world phenomena. The developed framework in this article yields a novel attention-driven metric to guide AS and mapping. It relies on an attention-based hybrid neural network that reveals the driving variables in terms of the heterogeneities and complexities in a natural environment. The high-priority regions are maximized in a coverage path depending on the inferred spatial attention distribution while maintaining the travel cost of the sensing robots within an available energy budget. Experiments using a remote sensing dataset validate the reliable performance of the proposed framework, in environmental field mapping.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2021.3077689","India-Canada Centre for Innovative Multidisciplinary Partnerships to Accelerate Community Transformation and Sustainability (IC-IMPACTS)(grant numbers:11R18083); Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC) Innovation and Technology Support Programme (ITSP) Tier 2(grant numbers:ITS/105/18FP); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9431671","Active sensing (AS) and planning;attention mechanism;deep hybrid neural network (HNN);mobile sensing robots;multivariate spatiotemporal field (MSF);scalar field mapping","Robot sensing systems;Robots;Sensors;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Monitoring;Biological system modeling;Neural networks","","9","","67","IEEE","14 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the high-dimensional action space and state space will result in reward sparsity and low training efficiency of robotic arm path planning. We propose a Bayesian optimization of Double-SAC algorithm using recent priority experience replay to solve these issues. We first propose the sampling method of recent prioritized experience replay (RPER), which combines recent sampling and prioritized experience replay (PER). The interval of experience pool is divided according to the recent sampling method, and sampling is performed according to the sample priority of the interval. Then we adopt a Bayesian optimization method that reduces the variance of the random strategy and improve the quality of the sampled actions. The larger variance is more beneficial for exploring the environment. Smaller variance is advantageous for exploiting good experiences to obtain higher returns. Our approach finds a good balance between exploration and exploitation. We train two Soft Actor Critic (SAC) agents to obtain two independent probability distributions, and a Bayesian optimizer is adopted to combine the two distributions to design a hybrid strategy. The hybrid strategy can output better actions according to the uncertainty estimation of the distribution, and further enhance training efficiency and stability. Finally, simulation tests are performed on the ROS-Gazebo platform, and the simulation results illustrate that the algorithm proposed in this paper converges faster and has a shorter training time than the original algorithm in terms of path planning performance.","2835-3358","979-8-3503-0732-0","10.1109/WRCSARA60131.2023.10261787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10261787","","Training;Uncertainty;Simulation;Reinforcement learning;Manipulators;Sampling methods;Path planning","","","","17","IEEE","27 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Understanding how scientists prioritize and balance these objectives is crucial for developing cognitively-compatible robotic teammates and fostering effective human-robot collaboration. In this study, we seek to improve the cognitive compatibility of robotic algorithms by modelling human’ decision making processes under multiple objectives. Collected human decision data from 141 sampling steps indicate that the majority of scientists adopt one of the following objective balancing strategies: (i) A Focus mode, where experts select sampling location to primarily optimize their primary objective; (ii) A Hierarchy mode, where experts hierarchically satisfy foremost their primary objective, then, to a lesser extent, their secondary objective; and (iii) A Trade-off mode, where experts select sampling locations to satisfy all objectives, even the location was not ideal for either objective. To understand how experts choose among the different modes, we quantitatively characterize the three types of strategies, by representing the decision data from each sampling step in an objective function space. Analysis of the strategy types reveals that, experts’ adaptation of multi-objective coordinating strategies are primarily governed by two key decision factors: current stages of sampling, and outstanding reward values. Based on this discovery, we developed a highly simplified decision algorithm that connects experts’ high-level objectives to desired sampling locations under multiple objectives. Deployment of this algorithm at a planetary-analogue field exploration mission on Mt. Hood demonstrates its potential in enabling robots to participate in the decision making process and suggest sampling plans that align well with scientists’ high-level goals.CCS CONCEPTS• Computing methodologies → Cognitive robotics.","2167-2121","979-8-4007-0322-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10660828","decision making;human-robot teaming;cognitive model","Robot kinematics;Computational modeling;Decision making;Human-robot interaction;Collaboration;Linear programming;Cognitive robotics","","","","53","","10 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yet, there is still a large disconnect with the path planning community mainly due to implementation difficulty. In this paper, we identify the issues and present a path planning framework that aims to ease the integration of machine learning models. The framework is divided into two phases: prediction and planning. During the prediction phase machine learning models are used to predict a path solution which, while not perfect, is enough to jump-start our proposed planner. The planning phase begins with the initialization of multiple independent tree data structures and, during execution, our planner merges the different trees until a path is found. Due to the architecture of our framework, the prediction and the planning phases are totally decoupled, resulting in a planner that treats the information given by the prediction model as a guess and not as a path to be corrected. This also allows our planner to maintain its probabilistic completeness. Our planner was evaluated on simulated environments and on a small robotic arm. We show that our planner can successfully leverage predicted paths to significantly improve the planning performances. We also demonstrate the flexibility of our framework by integrating multiple machine learning models of varying complexity.","2153-0866","978-1-6654-9190-7","10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10341747","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10341747","","Tree data structures;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Computer architecture;Predictive models;Probabilistic logic;Manipulators","","1","","37","IEEE","13 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Embodied AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with the environment through a physical or virtual body (e.g., robots, virtual agents), enabling perception, decision-making, and action in real or simulated spaces. We focus on their applications in robotic learning and control. By critically comparing the capabilities of mainstream simulation platforms such as Habitat and Isaac Gym, the study identifies core trade-offs between physical realism and computational efficiency. It further analyzes transfer methodologies, including domain randomization, domain adaptation, and hybrid techniques, highlighting their effectiveness and limitations in dynamic and unstructured environments. The review also investigates the emerging role of large multimodal models, such as PaLM-E and RT-2, in bridging semantic understanding with robotic action. While these models offer significant improvements in generalization and task planning, challenges remain in achieving real-time performance and physical grounding. The findings suggest that simulation fidelity alone does not guarantee successful transfer, hybrid transfer methods outperform single-strategy approaches in complex settings, and large language models hold promise for enhancing robot intelligence but must be optimized for embedded deployment. This study offers practical insights for developing scalable and cost-effective Sim2Real pipelines in industrial applications such as autonomous navigation and robotic manipulation.

This exoskeleton is lightweight, weighing 1.2 kg fully assembled, and offers a rapid step response, demonstrated by rise times of 69 ms $\pm$ 8.4e $-$4 for plantarflexion, and 95 ms $\pm$ 5.4e$-$2 for inversion–eversion.

LFA can cut off a target area from the network, without directly attacking the target. The attacker chooses links which when cut off will disconnect the target area and instruct the bots to flood those links with small packets. Some of the existing solutions are suitable for specific routing methods like shortest path routing or need cooperation between Autonomous Systems (AS). To overcome certain hitches of existing solutions, we have proposed a novel mechanism named BALANCE. It detects and mitigates LFA via hybrid-Software-Defined Network (SDN). SDN splits the control and data plane using OpenFlow protocol. Hybrid SDN has both legacy and SDN nodes, with a controller in the control plane. We have used Service Based Hybrid SDN (SBHS), which is a type of hybrid-SDN. BALANCE begins with an algorithm that chooses nodes in an AS to be SBHS enabled in such a way that the controller can get statistics of all the links in the AS. Next, congestion detection and location algorithms are implemented in the controller to find the congested links. Finally, LFA bot detection and mitigation algorithms are implemented in the controller to mitigate LFA. BALANCE was evaluated in testbed and emulator. We compared the results with state-of-the-art solutions. BALANCE was able to detect LFA bots at a precision of 97.64% and had HTTP response time of 2 seconds during the LFA attack.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2020.2997734","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9099887","Link flooding attack;distributed denial of service;hybrid-software-defined network;security","Routing;Computer crime;Servers;Measurement;Bandwidth;Protocols;Collaboration","","32","","27","IEEE","26 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This capability allows a ship to autonomously survey and obtain situational awareness on a floating unresponsive target from a safe stand-off before inspecting it more closely or navigating around it. The target could be another ship, structure, or a navigational obstruction like an iceberg. The proposed solution is a collaborative system with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV), and an unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The UAV captures visual imagery to create a 3-D model of the target’s above-water geometry using photogrammetry. The UUV surveys the target’s submerged hull with integrated imaging and profiling bathymetric sonars. The USV hosts an intelligent mission-planning node which manages the robotic collaboration in a centralized architecture by autonomously planning and distributing the missions for the UUV and UAV. The intelligent node also adaptively plans the USV’s trajectory to support the other autonomous assets, specifically reducing and bounding the UUV’s state-estimate error through collaborative localization. The resulting above- and below-water sensor data is fused at the waterplane, using a sliding correlation algorithm, to yield a 3-D representation of the floating unresponsive target.

The cloud radio access network (C-RAN) is a promising mobile network architecture that can meet the ever-increasing resource demand of a growing number of users. In C-RAN, base station functionalities are separated into baseband units (BBUs) and remote radio heads (RRHs), with BBUs centralized and virtualized via cloud computing. However, this architecture introduces new challenges in efficiently allocating resources to dynamic users. This paper aims to design a resource allocation scheme that improves system efficiency and satisfies dynamic user demands in C-RAN. We propose a hybrid resource allocation approach that combines centralized control and multi-agent-based decision-making. The centralized controller, located within the BBU pool, collaborates with virtual base stations (VBSs) acting as multi-agent system (MAS) agents. The resource allocation solution is derived by jointly considering the real-time resource requests from agents and the historical demand estimates generated by the centralized controller. Through simulation-based evaluation, we compare our proposed scheme with conventional random and fixed resource allocation methods. The results demonstrate improved performance in terms of resource utilization, reduced unfulfilled demand, and fairness among VBS agents. The proposed combined resource allocation strategy effectively meets dynamic user requirements while maintaining system efficiency in C-RAN.

In the strategy, the pose of the monocular camera mounted at the end-effector is adaptively adjusted to improve the image quality through an algorithm based on the rough pose measurement of the target hole by the binocular camera; the accurate 3-D pose of the hole is determined by an algorithm based on processing of high-quality images and the compensation of the orientation error. Combined with the robotic collision-free path planning, the automatic peg-in-hole assembly can be implemented in real setting. The assembly precision of the robotic system based on the proposed method is validated and discussed based on experimental results. Then, the minimal peg-in-hole interval relative to the alignment error is modeled through the spatial relation analysis to analyze the applicable condition of the robotic system with the control strategy.

Previous methods have attempted to pick up a loose surgical needle in the environment and then use the same grasp to begin suturing; however, the initial needle grasp is not always ideal in terms of the needle pose with respect to the gripper or the workspace of the arm. Thus, it is advantageous to regrasp the needle in a more optimal manner before suturing proper begins. To solve the problem, a hybrid-object state space (HySS) planner is implemented under the RRT - Connect motion planning framework.

However, the application of LLMs to actual HRC systems requires the timely and comprehensive capturing of real-scene information. In this study, we suggest incorporating real scene data into LLMs using digital twin (DT) technology and present a cognitive digital twin prototype system of HRC manipulation, known as HRC-CogiDT. Specifically, we initially construct a scene semantic graph encoding the geometric information of entities, spatial relations between entities, actions of humans and robots, and collaborative activities. Subsequently, we devise a prompt that merges scene semantics with prior knowledge of activities, linking the real scene with LLMs. To evaluate performance, we compile an HRC scene understanding dataset and set up a laboratory-level experimental platform. Empirical results indicate that HRC-CogiDT can swiftly perceive scene changes and make high-level decisions based on varying task requirements, such as task planning, anomaly detection, and schedule reasoning. This study provides promising insights for the future applications of LLMs in robotics.Note to Practitioners—Recently, LLMs have demonstrated significant success in various robotic tasks, suggesting their potential as a powerful tool for robotic decision-making. Motivated by this, to improve the production efficiency of HRC in flexible manufacturing, we innovatively combine LLMs with DT technology, and propose a cognitive DT system for HRC, aiming to integrate LLMs into the decision-making loop of HRC system. Experiments conducted in a laboratory-scale platform indicate that the proposed system can handle different decision-making needs in different HRC activities.

Conversely, RRT* handles high-dimensional spaces but has slow convergence and suboptimal paths. The hybrid algorithm (Hybrid A*-RRT*) presented in this paper addresses these limitations by combining the heuristic-driven accuracy of $A^{\ast}$ with the random exploration of RRT*. First, the algorithm generates an optimal path using A* then directionally biases RRT* sampling regions of interest, thereby reducing unnecessary node expansion and accelerating convergence. Experiments demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness across dynamically generated maze environments with varying complexity levels determined by grid cell size. Key performance metrics include path length, the nodes inspected, the number of iterations, and the computational time. In complex environments, the hybrid method reduces computation time by 80 % compared to $A^{\ast}$ and by 59 % compared to RRT*, while maintaining Path lengths within 9 % of A* optimality and exploring 48 % fewer nodes than RRT*. The hybrid approach achieves 100 % success across all study environments, thereby illustrating its value in finding a middle path between solution speed and quality. In 3D or multi-agent circumstances, later studies might use this approach.","2836-9866","979-8-3315-2577-4","10.1109/EMES65692.2025.11045571","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11045571","A*;RRT*;Path Planning;Robot Navigation","Three-dimensional displays;Costs;Navigation;Heuristic algorithms;Path planning;Real-time systems;Computational efficiency;Complexity theory;Optimization;Convergence","","","","20","IEEE","27 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Aiming at this problem, this paper proposes a distributed imaging satellite mission planning method (DISMPA) based on multi-agent system. Firstly, a distributed imaging satellite mission planning model with variable collaborative division of labor is constructed based on multi-agent system theory. The model defines the intelligence level of satellites in the satellite cluster and the interaction mode between satellites. Secondly, the cooperation mechanism between satellite agents is established based on blackboard model. Two negotiation strategies of worker serial activation and worker parallel activation are proposed. In order to improve the efficiency of negotiation, the targets are preassigned before negotiation. Finally, a hybrid discrete multi-verse optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the mission planning problem of worker agents in the model. Simulation experiments show that the average fitness values obtained by DISMPM using serial activation strategy and DISMPM using parallel activation strategy are up to 20% higher than those obtained by the centralized algorithm with the best solution effect in this paper, and the average negotiation times of the two DISMPM methods are both reduced by more than 80% compared with the contract network algorithm, effectively reducing the system traffic and reducing the communication burden. It is proved that DISMPA is suitable for distributed imaging satellite mission planning.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3289964","Science and Technology on Complex Electronic System Simulation Laboratory(grant numbers:614201001032202); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10164111","Imaging satellite;mission planning;multi-agent","Satellites;Planning;Imaging;Contracts;Heuristic algorithms;Protocols;Multi-agent systems;Multi-agent systems","","10","","38","CCBY","27 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main goal is to navigate the robots from a starting point to a destination point without colliding with other robots or static obstacles. We propose a hybrid method -- H* -- that combines adaptive route planning based on A* and local search algorithm to optimize routes in the context of the MPP problem. The A* algorithm finds the optimal solution for the route search problem and a heuristic approach is applied to scale up to the multi-agent scenario.The overall length of determined paths and the number of robot collisions is minimized during the evaluations specific small-scale environments.Computational experiments are conducted for multi-robot scenarios and the performance of H* is compared to several path-searching algorithms including A* variations extended for the multi-agent scenario and coevolutionary algorithms.Experimental results demonstrate that H* outperforms the A* based heuristic approaches in terms of path length.

Integrated Task and Motion Planning (TMP) algorithms solve these hybrid problems jointly to consider constraints between the discrete symbolic actions (i.e., the task plan) and their continuous geometric realization (i.e., motion plans). This joint approach solves more difficult problems than approaches that address the task and motion subproblems independently. TMP algorithms combine and extend results from both task and motion planning. TMP has mainly focused on computational performance and completeness and less on solution optimality. Optimal TMP is difficult because the independent optima of the subproblems may not be the optimal integrated solution, which can only be found by jointly optimizing both plans. This letter presents Task and Motion Informed Trees (TMIT*), an optimal TMP algorithm that combines results from makespan-optimal task planning and almost-surely asymptotically optimal motion planning. TMIT* interleaves asymmetric forward and reverse searches to delay computationally expensive operations until necessary and perform an efficient informed search directly in the problem's hybrid state space. This allows it to solve problems quickly and then converge towards the optimal solution with additional computational time, as demonstrated on the evaluated robotic-manipulation benchmark problems.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2022.3199676","National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship; U.K. Research and Innovation/EPSRC(grant numbers:EP/S030832/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9869707","Task and motion planning;AI-based methods;manipulation planning;motion and path planning","Costs;Search problems;Cost function;Path planning;Hybrid power systems;Planning;Delays","","15","","38","IEEE","29 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Symbolic methods build modular systems with semantic parsing and task planning modules for producing sequences of actions from natural language requests. Modern connectionist methods employ deep neural networks that learn visual and linguistic features for mapping inputs to a sequence of low-level actions, in an end-to-end fashion. The hybrid, modular system blends these two approaches to create a modular framework: it formulates instruction following as symbolic goal learning via deep neural networks followed by task planning via symbolic planners. Connectionist and symbolic modules are bridged with Planning Domain Definition Language. The vision-and-language learning network predicts its goal representation, which is sent to a planner for producing a task-completing action sequence. For improving the flexibility of natural language, we further incorporate implicit human intents with explicit human instructions. To learn generic features for vision and language, we propose to separately pretrain vision and language encoders on scene graph parsing and semantic textual similarity tasks.

As a vehicle navigates at the limit of its capabilities over extreme terrain, its dynamics can change suddenly and dramatically. For example, varying terrain can affect parameters such as traction, tire slip, and rolling resistance. To achieve effective planning in such environments, it is crucial to have a dynamics model that can accurately anticipate these conditions and respond before an issue can occur. In this work, we present a hybrid model that predicts the changing dynamics induced by the terrain as a function of visual inputs. We leverage a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) DINOv2, which provides rich features that encodes fine-grained semantic information. To use this dynamics model for planning, we propose an end-to-end training architecture for a projection distance independent feature encoder that compresses the information from the VFM, enabling the creation of a lightweight map of the environment at runtime.

We argue that, in addition to making systems self-managing and autonomous, there is a need for a human-centric adaptive architecture in the data center management domain. This involves incorporating human-in-the-loop mechanisms to oversee the system's self-adaptation and control anomalies and other drifting pointers that could affect the system's quality attributes.

Martian caves and lava tubes like terrains, which consists of uneven ground, poor visibility and confined space, makes it impossible for wheel based rovers to navigate through these areas.

As current studies have tailored the design of gait trajectories for the target users, realizing a high-precision motion control is a critical issue for safe and effective assistance. The walking assistance involves unique characteristic phases that embody different physical constraints and requirements for assistance. Conventional methods often utilized gain-switching control for time-varying adaptation. However, despite their intuitiveness as well as simplicity, the control performance was unsatisfying due to unmodeled responses by human behavior and continuous interaction with the external environment. To tackle these challenges, this study proposes a hybrid control method applied to the disturbance observer that can provide robust robotic rehabilitation.

It is intended that this ISRU excavator concept be capable of material extraction from native regolith, and will be able to operate in a variety of planetary surface environments after initial shakedown on the moon. Using heritage from highly multi-functional, reconfigurable robotic systems like the All-Terrain Hex-Limbed Extra-Terrestrial Explorer (ATHLETE), Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operations Robot (RASSOR), and Mars exploration rovers, we propose a flexible maintenance-optimized mobility platform concept with quick-connect/disconnect features for robotically swappable excavation implements.

Assessing spacecraft microbial cleanliness against a quantitative bioburden threshold at launch is just not relevant for the habitable spacecraft environments that would be introduced to the Martian surface, when the astronauts themselves each have circa eight orders of magnitude more microorganisms on and in their bodies than would be permitted for a typical robotic Mars lander mission. The international COSPAR PP policy recognizes this, but also states that; “the intent of planetary protection is the same whether a mission to Mars is conducted robotically or with human explorers. Accordingly, planetary protection goals should not be relaxed to accommodate a human mission to Mars. Rather, they become even more directly relevant to such missions — even if specific implementation guidelines should differ.” The goals that are to remain the same (as described in Article IX of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty) are: i) to avoid the harmful contamination of the target solar system body (Mars in this case), and ii) to avoid adverse changes in the environment of the Earth resulting from the introduction of extraterrestrial matter. But what then are the implementation guidelines that should differ? The NASEM CoPP in its recent (2021) “Evaluation of Bioburden Requirements for Mars Missions” report declined to recommend relaxation of the present robotic requirements, noting that for such relaxation to be acceptable, any landing site needs “to be a conservative distance from any subsurface access point”, and that such a determination would also need to consider wind conditions for the location and season, and best estimates of microorganism survival time in the surface UV environment. This knowledge is simply not available at present, but this paper will provide an update on these and other “knowledge gaps” identified in a workshop series on PP for crewed Mars missions. Additionally, the paper will describe progress to incorporate the addressing of PP constraints in ongoing activities within NASA as the Moon to Mars architecture is matured. Finally, because the scientific community has been unable to provide a consensus answer to the question “How much is too much?”, in regard to the contamination that a crewed spacecraft mission might introduce to Mars, the paper will describe work to model and quantitate the microbial bioburden associated with the hardware and operations of NASA's crewed Mars surface mission concepts.","2996-2358","979-8-3503-5597-0","10.1109/AERO63441.2025.11068471","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11068471","","Space vehicles;Mars;Microorganisms;Surface contamination;Space missions;NASA;Moon;Solar system;Protection;Guidelines","","","","33","USGov","14 Jul 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For synthesis modeling, we develop a state-space equation of the hybrid robot by the combination of the rigid and soft parts, where the rigid model is built by differential kinematics, and Piecewise Constant-Curvature and Lagrange equations are used to model the soft part with consideration of the elastic deformation caused by gravity loading. Based on the synthesis model, a model predictive controller is designed to eliminate the error between the hybrid robot terminal and the target position. Considering the imprecise modeling process disturbs the control performance, a data-driven strategy named input mapping is incorporated into the predictive controller to reduce the inaccuracy model effect and improve the control performance. In addition, the feedback error of the hybrid robot is transferred in the robot terminal coordinate system to avoid hand-eye calibration work.

The heterogeneity and dynamism anticipated for 6Gclass networks only magnify the shortcomings of today’s rigid, rule-based automation pipelines. This paper introduces an intent-driven, fully autonomous reconfiguration framework that integrates Generative AI with a hierarchical Multi-Agent architecture. At its core, a ReWOOenhanced Chief Agent transforms natural-language intents into a dependency-aware execution graph, utilizing a formally defined Command Pattern to explicitly specify actions and associated data for unambiguous inter-agent coordination. Atomic tasks-annotated with domain-specific constraints and keys governed by a Primary Key Pattern-are delegated to ReAct-based Specific Agents responsible for IP management, network control, cloud orchestration, and service management. Evaluation on a four-domain OSS testbed exposing over thirty RESTful APIs confirms accurate intent parsing, robust key-value consistency enforcement, strict adherence to create-before-destroy constraints, and seamless scalability from single-domain provisioning to complex cross-domain orchestration without code changes. The proposed work delivers a reusable agent blueprint decoupling global planning from domain execution; formal interagent interfaces curbing hallucination and enabling modular growth; an execution-aware extension to ReWOO for structured action planning; domain-driven guidelines for encapsulating OSS subsystems into loosely coupled agents; and a public OSS testbed for benchmarking future Agentic-AI architectures-collectively advancing OSS reconfiguration toward scalable, maintainable, and 6G-ready network operations.","2576-8565","978-4-88552-356-4","10.23919/APNOMS67058.2025.11181316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11181316","LLM;Large Language Model;Multi-Agent;Agents;Gen AI;Operation Support Systems;Autonomous Networks;Agent Patterns","6G mobile communication;Generative AI;Scalability;Large language models;Pipelines;Restful API;Transforms;Planning;IP networks;Guidelines","","","","15","","6 Oct 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The conceptual mission architecture for Mars Sample Return (MSR) must demonstrate robust containment and rigorous control of all unsterilized materials as assurance of no inadvertent harm to Earth's biosphere. Launch of NASA's drilling and caching Mars rover in summer 2020 could potentially be the first step in an extraordinary campaign to bring carefully collected and sealed samples of sedimentary and igneous rocks from Mars to Earth for scientific study. As part of this notional architecture, NASA would launch a sample return platform early as 2026 to land near the area explored by the Mars 2020 rover and ESA would launch separately an Earth Return Orbiter (ERO). A small ESA fetch rover would depart from the platform and drive rapidly to locations where samples tubes have been placed on the ground for retrieval. The fetch rover and/or the Mars 2020 rover could return to the platform, allowing a robotic arm to transfer samples tubes into a sample container on a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV). The sample container would be launched and then released by the MAV in Mars orbit where the waiting ERO would capture the container and seal it in a doubled-walled containment canister. Various combinations of sterilization and dust mitigation are under consideration for breaking the chain of contact with putative contaminants. Minimizing the area of surfaces exposed to Martian dust and performing one or more sterilization procedures are key options for compliance with backward planetary protection prior to departure from Mars orbit. Once landed on Earth, entry vehicle inspection followed by additional cleaning and biobarrier deployment would ensure safe handling during transport to a state-of-the-art receiving facility.

Challenges include the strong static magnetic field, rapidly switching magnetic field gradients, high-power radio frequency pulses, sensitivity to electrical noise, and constrained space to operate within the bore of the scanner. MRI has a number of advantages over other medical imaging modalities, including no ionizing radiation, excellent soft-tissue contrast that allows for visualization of tumors and other features that are not readily visible by other modalities, true 3-D imaging capabilities, including the ability to image arbitrary scan plane geometry or perform volumetric imaging, and capability for multimodality sensing, including diffusion, dynamic contrast, blood flow, blood oxygenation, temperature, and tracking of biomarkers. The use of robotic assistants within the MRI bore, alongside the patient during imaging, enables intraoperative MR imaging (iMRI) to guide a surgical intervention in a closed-loop fashion that can include tracking of tissue deformation and target motion, localization of instrumentation, and monitoring of therapy delivery. With the ever-expanding clinical use of MRI, MRI-compatible robotic systems have been heralded as a new approach to assist interventional procedures to allow physicians to treat patients more accurately and effectively. Deploying robotic systems inside the bore synergizes the visual capability of MRI and the manipulation capability of robotic assistance, resulting in a closed-loop surgery architecture. This article details the challenges and history of robotic systems intended to operate in an MRI environment and outlines promising clinical applications and associated state-of-the-art MRI-compatible robotic systems and technology for making this possible.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2022.3169146","National Science Foundation under CAREER(grant numbers:1944655); National Science Foundation Future of Work(grant numbers:2026622); Research Grants Council(grant numbers:17207020); Innovation and Technology Commission(grant numbers:MRP/029/20X); National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:R01CA248191,R01EB025179); National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:R01EB025179,R01CA235134); Collaborative Research Agreement with the Multi-Scale Medical Robotics Center in Hong Kong; National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CISE IIS-1563805); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:R01HL153034); National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering of the National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:R01EB008713,R01EB015870,R21EB008796); National Institutes of Health from the National Cancer Institute(grant numbers:R01CA166379); National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering(grant numbers:R01EB030539); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9767198","Fiber optic sensors;image-guided surgery;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-compatible robots;piezoelectric actuators;sensors and actuators;surgical robots","Magnetic resonance imaging;Medical robotics;Imaging;Robot sensing systems;Robot kinematics;Biomedical imaging;Sensors","","76","","205","CCBY","3 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

High uncertainty caused by unknown opponents’ strategies, dynamic obstacles, and insufficient training complicates the action space into a hybrid decision process. Although the deep reinforcement learning method is significant for swarm confrontation since it can handle various sizes, as an end-to–end implementation, it cannot deal with the hybrid process. Here, we propose a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning approach consisting of a target allocation layer, a path planning layer, and the underlying dynamic interaction mechanism between the two layers, which indicates the quantified uncertainty. It decouples the hybrid process into discrete allocation and continuous planning layers, with a probabilistic ensemble model to quantify the uncertainty and regulate the interaction frequency adaptively. Furthermore, to overcome the unstable training process introduced by the two layers, we design an integration training method including pre-training and cross-training, which enhances the training efficiency and stability. Experiment results in both comparison, ablation, and real-robot studies validate the effectiveness and generalization performance of our proposed approach. In our defined experiments with twenty to forty agents, the win rate of the proposed method reaches around ninety percent, outperforming other traditional methods. Note to Practitioners—With artificial intelligence rapidly developing, robots will play a significant role in the future. Especially, the swarm formed by many robots holds promising potential in civil and military applications. Promoting the swarm into games or battles is rather riveting. The reinforcement learning method provides a plausible solution to realize the battle of robotic swarms. There are still some issues that need to be addressed. On one hand, we focus on the uncertainty caused by the battlefield nature and the environment which limits our ability for the implementation of swarms. On the other hand, we solve the problem that the decision process combined with commands and actions is a hybrid system, which cannot be directly reflected in the confrontation of swarms.

PSO, however, has significant flaws like poor exploration capacity and a lack of diversity in the particles. PSO may become vulnerable to local minima due to either of these constraints. Inertia weight formulation and hybridization with other metaheuristic algorithms are two popular strategies for overcoming PSO's drawbacks.

To address this issue, this paper presents a successive convex approximation-based fast collision-free motion planning framework to address this issue. The key idea is to convert non-convex collision avoidance constraints into smooth convex constraints and use the successive convex approximation method to improve the computational efficiency.

Our evaluation in a robotic manipulation domain with sequential novelty injections demonstrates that our approach converges faster and outperforms state-of-the-art hybrid methods.","","979-8-3315-4139-2","10.1109/ICRA55743.2025.11128650","ONR(grant numbers:N00014-24-1-2024); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11128650","","Learning systems;Adaptation models;Scalability;Dynamics;Stochastic processes;Hybrid power systems;Planning;Robots;Faces","","","","42","IEEE","2 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, initially devised plans for completing a mission may no longer be feasible, and a re-planning process needs to take place to re-allocate any pending tasks. There are two main approaches to solve the re-planning problem (i) global re-planning techniques using a centralized planner that will redo the task allocation with the updated world state and (ii) decentralized approaches that will focus on the local plan reparation, i.e., the re-allocation of those tasks initially assigned to the failed robots, better suited to a dynamic environment and less computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach, named GLocal, that combines both strategies to exploit the benefits of both, while limiting their respective drawbacks. GLocal was compared to a planner-only, and an agent-only approach, under different conditions. We show that GLocal produces shorter mission make-spans as the number of tasks and failed agents increases, while also balancing the tradeoff between the number of messages exchanged and the number of requests to the planner.","2472-8322","978-1-6654-3065-4","10.1109/SSCI52147.2023.10371893","Aarhus University; Innovation Fund Denmark; Swedish Research Council (VR); PSI project(grant numbers:2020-05094); Knowledge Foundation (KKS); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10371893","Multi-Agent Systems;Autonomous Agents;Centralized Planning;Decentralized Planning","Limiting;Costs;Computer architecture;Dynamic scheduling;Planning;Resource management;Task analysis","","2","","19","IEEE","1 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, high-quality image acquisition heavily relies on experienced sonographers, which restricts its further popularization. In this paper, a robotic system designed for automated spinal ultrasound scanning is proposed. Drawing inspiration from the spinal anatomy and the actions of seasoned sonographers, the system integrates both a deep learning agent and a reinforcement learning agent to collaboratively guide the adjustment of the ultrasound probe in external-vision-independent environments, relying on real-time ultrasound images and contact force. Then, a hybrid force-to-velocity control framework is proposed to ensure proper ultrasound coupling during the scanning process. Experimental results on a phantom and human participants demonstrated that this system can accurately track spinal features (mean error: less than 1 mm) and maintain normal probe orientation (out-of-plane angular error:  $1.61~\pm ~1.1^{\circ }$ , in-plane angular error:  $1.27~\pm ~0.9^{\circ }$ ), resulting in high-quality and reproducible ultrasound images. Overall, our system shows great potential for clinical applications. Note to Practitioners—This paper is motivated by the increasing needs of human-robot interaction in medical applications, with a specific emphasis on robotic ultrasound imaging. Clinical sonographers suffer from repetitive workload during the diagnostic process, highlighting the significance of automated scanning solutions. In this work, we propose a modular control framework for ultrasound probe positioning that supports a multi-modal autonomous ultrasound scanning system. The system operates independently of external optics or prior geometric knowledge of the scanning object. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the system can effectively cover the region of interest of the spine, facilitating high-quality ultrasound image acquisition and related disease assessment. This advancement is expected to enhance the efficiency of human-robot interaction in healthcare settings and holds promising clinical applications.

The challenge of making accurate estimations of distances and speeds arises from the discrete nature of video sensors that project the 3D world into a 2D discrete plane. This work will study the concept of estimating the speed of an object by only using the camera data. Rather than using a separate mechanism dependent on camera specifications, we consider a convolutional neural network fed recurrent neural network to estimate the speed at each time step. The video data can be fed to an object detection algorithm to extract the features and patterns in the videos. The network architecture is designed to make use of pre-trained object detection models to extract features from camera video feed and embed them into a data cluster. This cluster can represent the spatiotemporal information of the objects in the video frames. A recurrent neural network is then used to learn the association of the motion speed values with respect to the changes in the features within the cluster. Based on this structure, both the object detector and the recurrent neural network can be trained end-to-end to detect and estimate the speed of objects in videos. This network architecture would not require additional sensors for calibration, while providing a cost-effective solution for mobile robotic applications such as autonomous ground vehicles or drones. The proposed methodology, network architecture and its components will be discussed in detail. This paper also presents a video data case study and preliminary results to demonstrate the development and use of the speed estimation network.

Robots should be able to carry out any assigned task autonomously, yet cooperate with other robots when allowed to by the environmental conditions. To enable this, there is a growing interest in robotic software solutions which are modular, scalable and easy to test. In this paper, we introduce iCADME, a novel autonomy architecture, which achieves such features thanks to a software eco-system which relies on a hierarchy of tasks, in charge of perception and decision-making, and of behaviour strategies, which act as the interface towards the robot lower level control architecture. The modularity and the attention to the system configuration are instrumental for the user to reuse the software and to expand the task portfolio. Thanks to the strong decoupling between perception/decision-making and action, achieved also with the design of an interface layer with the external middleware, iCADME can be easily integrated with various planning and control systems and with different middleware software. On top of that, a behaviour trees (BTs) mission management system is introduced. BTs enable the building of complex missions by assembling a portfolio of tasks, with features of high modularity and reactivity. All these iCADME's features were succesfully tested during MEDASWAN23 trial.

This shift towards automation is driven by the quest for efficiency and the need for enhanced safety, particularly in hazardous working conditions characterized by fumes, high temperatures, and pressures. This study considers the vision-aided trajectory generation strategies, which represent a combination of software and hardware-based approaches designed for automatic robotic welding. The proposed process involves the utilization of image processing techniques facilitated by an industrial camera (Zivid 2) to compute essential parameters.

The high level planner determines the object trajectory as well as the grasp changes, i.e. adding, removing, or sliding fingers, to be executed by the low-level controller. While the grasp sequence is planned online by a learning-based policy to adapt to variations, the trajectory planner and the low-level controller for object tracking and contact force control are exclusively model-based to robustly realize the plan. By infusing the knowledge about the physics of the problem and the low-level controller into the grasp planner, it learns to successfully generate grasps similar to those generated by model-based optimization approaches, obviating the high computation cost of online running of such methods to account for variations.

While numerous studies have explored learning-based planning methods to address this challenge, diffusion-based planning methods have recently emerged as a promising approach in robotic path planning by modeling action sequences as probabilistic trajectories and capturing diverse planning behaviors under uncertainty. However, they still face significant challenges in generalizing to unseen situations and demand extensive data collection to achieve robust performance. In particular, efforts to ensure general robustness by learning from all possible scenarios can introduce inefficiencies, as many cases may be irrelevant during actual deployment. To address these challenges, this study proposes the Hybrid A*-Diffusion Planner (HADP), designed to achieve robust navigation performance even in unseen dynamic environments. In obstacle-free environments, HADP employs the A* algorithm for global path planning, whereas when a dynamic obstacle is detected within a predefined boundary, it records observations and leverages a conditional diffusion model to generate a local avoidance path. After avoidance, the path is re-planned using A*. To enable the diffusion model to generate effective avoidance paths, a semantic map is constructed by incorporating key environmental information within the predefined boundary. This map, along with the robot’s position and local goal information, serves as a conditional input to the diffusion model. HADP is trained on an expert trajectory dataset created by recording expert-driven navigation across various dynamic obstacle avoidance scenarios. Experiments in various simulations in dynamic obstacle environments demonstrated HADP’s superior success rate, trajectory smoothness, and robust generalization performance in unseen environments compared to existing approaches. Real-world tests further confirmed its practical applicability and highlighted its potential as a robust and scalable solution for dynamic obstacle environments, and the simulation code used in this study is publicly available at https://github.com/DSLab-MJU/HADP","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3609454","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Ministry of Education(grant numbers:RS-2024-00356169); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11162530","Dynamic obstacle avoidance;hybrid planning system;conditional diffusion model;motion and path planning;autonomous mobile robot","Heuristic algorithms;Robots;Navigation;Collision avoidance;Diffusion models;Trajectory;Planning;Semantics;Autonomous vehicles;Robot sensing systems","","","","42","CCBYNCND","12 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Autonomy is a capability area necessary to handle long communication outages where intervention from Earth is impossible, to prepare to operate with long communication delays that will be common in interplanetary travel, and to make spaceflight more affordable and accessible by reducing sustaining operations costs. The Gateway Concept of Operations states that one of Gateway’s goals is to “focus on infrastructure and systems that will allow autonomous operations aboard the Gateway with robotics, automated systems, advanced communications, and distributed computing.”Gateway’s Vehicle Systems Manager (VSM) and associated Autonomous Spacecraft Management Architecture (ASMA) are key products towards delivering autonomous capability. The primary functions of the control architecture are Mission Management and Timeline Execution, Resource Management, Fault Management, and Vehicle Control and Operation (VCO). In each of these areas, there is an initial level of capability to be delivered at launch, with plans to continue development and grow to greater capability. The initial deployment of VSM will focus on maintaining vehicle safety by focusing on full fault management capabilities and deploying only enough resource and timeline planning functionality to support that. The final deployment of VSM will add significant planning and control optimization functionality to support nominal operations for up to 21 days without ground support, even accommodating fault and failure conditions. While the VSM is the vehicle-level representation of autonomous reasoning, distributed automation is essential to provide the right scope and abstraction of information to process. Module and system support of automation and simplicity of interfaces are two important design paradigms that Gateway is focusing on to garner a systems approach to autonomy. Distribution of reasoning can increase complexity, so Gateway is also taking a strict hierarchical approach to information flow and decision making.VSM is not the only capability necessary to achieve an autonomous spacecraft. Robotics support for maintenance of the spacecraft will be essential to provide continued vehicle functionality even when crew is not present. Technical and programmatic challenges exist when implementing autonomous robotics operations. These challenges include sufficient network flexibility to support data transfer to the rest of the vehicle to coordinate module-to-module robotic walk-offs and finding the proper interfaces to allow sufficient dexterity. Communication system upgrades planned for Gateway include Delay Tolerant Networking to best utilize the complex network of relays that will be part of mature cislunar operations. Distributed computing and management will provide failure tolerance, robustness, and growth of capabilities while still allowing significant reuse of heritage software on heritage systems as well as reuse of common applications across a spacecraft to minimize new development, but this requires adherence to key standards and interfaces.The Gateway program has demonstrated significant progress towards these capabilities and has identified challenges other spacecraft developers should be aware of from the start.","1095-323X","979-8-3503-0462-6","10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10521067","","Space vehicles;Earth;Mars;Robot kinematics;Focusing;Computer architecture;Logic gates","","","","0","USGov","13 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the complexity of driving tasks often necessitates the collaboration of multiple, heterogeneous agents, underscoring the need for such LLM-driven agents to engage in cooperative knowledge sharing and cognitive synergy. Despite the promise of LLMs, current applications predominantly center around single-agent scenarios. To broaden the horizons of knowledge-driven strategies and bolster the generalization capabilities of autonomous agents, we propose the KoMA framework consisting of multi-agent interaction, multi-step planning, shared-memory, and ranking-based reflection modules to enhance multi-agents' decision-making in complex driving scenarios. Based on the framework's generated text descriptions of driving scenarios, the multi-agent interaction module enables LLM agents to analyze and infer the intentions of surrounding vehicles based on scene information, akin to human cognition. The multi-step planning module enables LLM agents to analyze and obtain final action decisions layer by layer to ensure consistent goals for short-term action decisions. The shared memory module can accumulate collective experience to make superior decisions, and the ranking-based reflection module can evaluate and improve agent behavior with the aim of enhancing driving safety and efficiency. The KoMA framework not only enhances the robustness and adaptability of autonomous driving agents but also significantly elevates their generalization capabilities across diverse scenarios.

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising framework for agent collaboration, but it faces difficulties in handling complex tasks and designing reward functions. The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought stronger reasoning and cognitive abilities to MAS, but existing LLM-based systems struggle to respond quickly and accurately in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-based Graph Collaboration MARL (LGC-MARL), a framework that efficiently combines LLMs and MARL. This framework decomposes complex tasks into executable subtasks and achieves efficient collaboration among multiple agents through graph-based coordination. Specifically, LGC-MARL consists of two main components: an LLM planner and a graph-based collaboration meta policy. The LLM planner transforms complex task instructions into a series of executable subtasks, evaluates the rationality of these subtasks using a critic model, and generates an action dependency graph. The graph-based collaboration meta policy facilitates communication and collaboration among agents based on the action dependency graph, and adapts to new task environments through meta-learning. Experimental results on the AI2-THOR simulation platform demonstrate the superior performance and scalability of LGC-MARL in completing various complex tasks.","","979-8-3315-4139-2","10.1109/ICRA55743.2025.11127486","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11127486","","Metalearning;Scalability;Large language models;Collaboration;Reinforcement learning;Transforms;Signal generators;Safety;Robotics and automation;Multi-agent systems","","","","36","IEEE","2 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These systems integrate perception, cognition, and action through integrated task and motion planning (TAMP), leveraging the advanced reasoning and communication capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, their efficiency is often hindered by challenges such as high computational latency and redundant communication, largely due to the reliance on LLMs for sequential planning decisions. In this paper, we aim to identify the inherent characteristics and optimization opportunities in cooperative embodied AI systems. We first present a cognitive-inspired modular framework encompassing perception, memory, communication, planning, and execution. We then conduct a detailed profiling analysis of two state-of-the-art cooperative embodied systems, revealing the significance of each module and identifying critical bottlenecks such as redundant message pre-generation and excessive LLM usage in decision-making processes. Based on these insights, we propose several model- and system-level optimizations, including a planning-first communication strategy, selective multi-agent communication, and planning-guided multi-step execution. Evaluated across long-horizon cooperative tasks, these optimizations reduce the frequency of LLM inference runs, achieving an average 3.93× speedup in end-to-end task execution.

However, existing methods rely solely on point clouds and neglect geometric features like plane normals, leading to suboptimal spatial alignment. Additionally, the lack of an intelligent view selection strategy worsens initial alignment errors, causing cumulative inaccuracies and degraded performance. We propose HCNV, a novel framework that combines optimized point cloud alignment with intelligent view selection to overcome these limitations. Our method uses plane normals and a hybrid genetic algorithm to refine the point cloud transformation matrix, significantly improving spatial alignment accuracy. Furthermore, the intelligent view selection strategy enhances point cloud matching and optimizes view coverage, increasing robustness across various conditions. Experimental results show that HCNV improves calibration accuracy by 20% and reduces computational time by 30% compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality in real-world applications. Note to Practitioners—This paper addresses the robotic hand-eye calibration problem, essential for accurate sensor alignment. Existing methods face two main challenges: 1) the lack of geometric model information, leading to insufficient constraints during point cloud alignment and resulting in cumulative errors, and 2) the absence of a mechanism to filter out views with significant point cloud errors during calibration. To address these issues, we propose a novel hand-eye calibration framework, HCNV, which optimizes point cloud alignment by fitting point clouds to planes, improving relative pose estimation accuracy. Additionally, the framework incorporates an error-based view selection strategy to reduce the impact of reprojection errors during calibration. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques on both synthetic and real-world datasets.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2025.3568141","Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research(grant numbers:2023B0303000016); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U21A20487); Shenzhen Technology Project(grant numbers:JCYJ20220818101206014,JCYJ20220818101211025,GJHZ20240218112504008); Yunnan Science and Technology Project(grant numbers:202305AF150152,202302AD080008); Guangdong Technology Project(grant numbers:2023TX07Z126); Shenzhen High-tech Zone Development Special Plan Innovation Platform Construction Project for High Precision and High Resolution 4D imaging; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10993421","Hand-eye calibration;point cloud alignment;plane normals;view selection","Calibration;Accuracy;Point cloud compression;Robots;Cameras;Robot kinematics;Robot vision systems;Optimization;Three-dimensional displays;Automation","","1","","65","IEEE","8 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, patient respiration can cause liver drift, causing small target lesions to deviate from the ultrasound imaging plane and become invisible, complicating accurate punctures. To address this, we introduce an automatic robotic respiratory liver motion compensation method, which relies on real-time estimation of liver motion to maintain the stability between the ultrasound imaging plane and the lesion observation plane. We propose an end-to-end respiratory liver motion estimation network, termed ReME-Net. This network effectively utilizes the difference features between the current and target ultrasound frames, combined with the sequential channel-spatial attention mechanism, to accurately estimate the six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) respiratory liver motion in real time, without any tracking device. We employ a hybrid force–position control framework with an adaptive variable admittance controller to ensure stable probe-skin contact while compensating for liver motion, facilitating stable imaging of small lesions. On this basis, a robotic ultrasound imaging system is developed and experiments on a liver motion simulation platform demonstrate successful tracking with mean errors of 3.05 mm in translation, 2.52° in rotation, and 0.25 N in contact force, while periodic liver motion has a translation amplitude of 19.72 mm and a rotation amplitude of 17.32°.

However, existing works were mostly focused on achieving superior payload and perception with simple planar workspaces, resulting in far less dexterity compared with conventional grippers.

With very lightweight pneumatic bellows soft actuators, the gripper could grasp objects over 20 times its weight with lateral compliance. Using the dual-arm platform, highly anthropomorphic dexterous manipulations were demonstrated using two hybrid grippers, from tug of war on a rigid rod to passing a soft towel between two grippers using in-hand manipulation.

Our current work focuses on networks of cost efficient inflatable Microbots with the intent of rugged environment exploration. These robots deploy inflatables filled with regolith which vary softness allowing them to crawl over obstacles. The generic architecture of these shape-morphing Microbots has been developed and is suitable as a payload on board satellites of size 1U and above. Our future analysis points towards the feasibility of such systems being distributed in large numbers on planetary surfaces while conforming to CubeSat design specifications. The results of our present work will provide insight into the structural dependability, lead to prototype development, texting, and improvement.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-2734-7","10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172340","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9172340","","Space vehicles;Costs;Shape;Moon;NASA;Prototypes;Extraterrestrial measurements;Robots;Geologic measurements;Payloads","","","","11","IEEE","21 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Intellectualization of integrated management systems using robotic systems and complexes is presented comprehensively at the level of organizational, organizational and resource (taking into account their decomposition into organizational-information, organizational-cognitive, organizational-technical) and technical-technological processes. The main features of target processes in the life cycle of an integrated control system when including functional systems based on robotic systems and complexes in its composition are given. The complete group of target processes is considered. This approach is universal and is proposed to describe the structure of counteracting processes that have an artificial origin. In the lifecycle of integrated systems. The main content of developers' work on providing target processes at the stages of the integrated management system life cycle is considered: research, development, testing and operation of integrated management systems. It is shown that organizational and resource processes are the most flexible and capable of prompt adjustment at the operational stage. The article considers the development trend of integrated management systems as network-centric systems that allow for the reallocation of resources for the implementation of the main functions of the system. On a process basis, in accordance with the system triad, which includes the principles of openness, non-linearity and coherence, the conditions for implementing synergetic properties are considered. For this purpose, conditions should be created for the emergence of synergetic processes within the full group of processes aimed at implementing functionality. To create such conditions should be identified and promptly addressed vulnerability at the interface of the target process, to timely and qualitatively addressed the negative conditions for the implementation of opposing processes of external and internal origin, a rational way to be the formation and implementation of institutional, organizational, resource and technical-technological processes in the composition of their complete group. It is shown that such conditions should be planned and provided at the early stages of the integrated systems life cycle during research to determine the main organizational, technical, system and technological solutions. Organizational and resource processes can be quickly adjusted during operation. Technical and technological processes provided for at the stage of development of the control system do not have wide opportunities for their correction.","","978-1-7281-6072-6","10.1109/SYNCHROINFO49631.2020.9166105","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9166105","Intelligent integrated control systems;robotic systems;functional-hierarchical and process approaches;synchronization of processes in the life cycle of the system;the triad of principles of openness;non-linearity and coherence of systems;synergetic effect","Process control;Tools;Robots;Centralized control;Organizations;Market research","","1","","10","IEEE","13 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The dataset consists of multimodality breast MRI of T2W and STIR images obtained from 10 patients. A statistical analysis of segmentation tasks emphasizes the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), segmentation accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. We first use a single class labeling to segment the breast region and then exploit it as an input for three-class labeling to segment fatty, fibroglandular (FGT), and tumorous tissues. The first network has a 0.95 DCS, while the second network has a 0.95, 0.83, and 0.41 for fat, FGT, and tumor classes, respectively. Clinical Relevance—This research is relevant to the breast surgery community as it establishes a deep learning-based (DL) algorithmic and phantomic foundation for surgical planning and navigation that will exploit preoperative multimodal MRI and intraoperative ultrasound to achieve highly cosmetic breast surgery. In addition, the planning and navigation will guide a robot that can cut, resect, bag, and grasp a tissue mass that encapsulates breast tumors and positive tissue margins.

Surgeons conventionally achieve this precision through intraoperative adjustments to the cutting plan, responding to deformations from tool-tissue interactions. This study examines the integration of physics-based tissue cutting simulations into autonomous robotic surgery to preoperatively predict and compensate for such deformations, aiming to improve surgical precision and reduce the necessity for dynamic adjustments during autonomous surgeries. This study adapts a real-to-sim-to-real workflow. Initially, the Autonomous System for Tumor Resection (ASTR) was employed to evaluate its accuracy in performing preoperatively intended incisions along the irregular contours of porcine tongue pseudotumors. Following this, a finite element analysis-based simulation, utilizing the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA), was developed and tuned to accurately mimic these tissue and incision interactions. Insights gained from this simulation were applied to refine the robot’s path planning, ensuring a closer alignment of actual incisions with the initially intended surgical plan. The efficacy of this approach was validated by comparing surface incision precision on ex vivo porcine tongues, with the average absolute error reducing from 1.73mm to 1.46mm after applying simulation-driven path adjustments (p < 0.001). Additionally, our method not only demonstrated improvements in maintaining the intended cutting shapes and locations, with shape matching scores using Hu moments enhancing from 0.10 to 0.06 and centroid shifts decreasing from 2.09mm to 1.33mm, but it also potentially reduced the likelihood of adverse oncologic outcomes by preventing clinically suggested excessively close margins of 2.2mm. This feasibility study suggests that merging physics-based cutting simulations with autonomous robotic surgery could potentially lead to more accurate incisions.","2153-0866","979-8-3503-7770-5","10.1109/IROS58592.2024.10802347","Health; National Science Foundation; Health; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10802347","","Deformable models;Adaptation models;Analytical models;Accuracy;Ultrasonic imaging;Shape;Deformation;Surgery;Path planning;Tumors","","","","31","IEEE","25 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system combines a Brushless DC (BLDC) motor, a planetary gearbox, and a rotary pneumatic actuator serving as an elastic element. While the gearbox offers advantages such as low cost and back-drivability, it suffers from significant backlash due to manufacturing tolerances. To address this, the actuator connects the gearbox output shaft directly to that of the pneumatic actuator. For a parallel configuration, both stators are mounted on an aluminum holder supporting the entire assembly. Within the backlash region, the system behaves as a Series Elastic Actuator (SEA), with the pneumatic actuator’s elasticity influencing stiffness, damping, and inertia. Outside this region, the system transitions to a Parallel Elastic Actuator (PEA), rigidly coupling the motor and gearbox shafts. A hybrid modeling approach is introduced to capture the actuator’s dynamic response. The SEA behavior is modeled using a closed box Artificial Neural Network (ANN), specifically an Echo State Network (ESN), which showed the lowest mean squared error (MSE) among the tested architectures. The PEA behavior is modeled using a gray-box approach, combining a linear dynamic block with a nonlinear static block represented by an ANN (Wiener model). This hybrid framework, integrating an ESN, achieved lower prediction error and better performance than other ANN architectures, as confirmed by experimental results.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3580222","Nazarbayev University under the Faculty Development Competitive Research Grants Program through the Development of an Intrinsically Safe Actuation System with Adaptive Neuromorphic Control for Humanoid Robotics Application(grant numbers:021220FD0551); Designing an Energy-Efficient Full-Sized Humanoid Robot with Fast Adaptive Model-Based Neuromorphic Control Architecture Project(grant numbers:201223FD8812); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11037454","Parallel elastic actuators;compliant actuators;neural network modeling;variable stiffness systems;pneumatic actuators;backlash compensation;dynamic modeling","Motors;Torque;Pneumatic actuators;Robots;Adaptation models;Computer architecture;Computational modeling;Artificial neural networks;Valves;Springs","","","","70","CCBYNCND","16 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The current pre-programmed disassembly conducted by the Autonomous Mobile Manipulator Robot(AMMR) struggles to meet the disassembly requirements in dynamic environments, complex scenarios, and unstructured processes. In this paper, we propose a Battery Disassembly AMMR(BEAM-1) system based on NeuralSymbolic AI. It detects the environmental state by leveraging a combination of multi-sensors and neural predicates and then translates this information into a quasi-symbolic space. In real-time, it identifies the optimal sequence of action primitives through LLM-heuristic tree search, ensuring high-precision execution of these primitives. Additionally, it employs positional speculative sampling using intuitive networks and achieves the disassembly of various bolt types with a meticulously designed end-effector. Importantly, BEAM-1 is a continuously learning embodied intelligence system capable of subjective reasoning like a human, and possessing intuition. A large number of real scene experiments have proved that it can autonomously perceive, decide, and execute to complete the continuous disassembly of bolts in multiple, multi-category, and complex situations, with a success rate of 98.78%. This research attempts to use NeuroSymbolic AI to give robots real autonomous reasoning, planning, and learning capabilities. BEAM-1 realizes the revolution of battery disassembly.

Instead of trying to learn representations that abstract all the variation factors of the environment as in most prior studies, MoSN labels its observations as their causes so that it can learn representations of visual states in a self-supervised manner. These representations are then used to enhance perceptual and cognitive abilities and to perform our robotic visual task when a robot takes over a new environment. In particular, this study proposes a momentum-based Siamese network with augmentation methods and a hybrid explicit contrastive loss to improve the combinatorial generalization capability of our model. We validate MoSN in real-world environments equipped with lights and light switches and attempt to derive the cause-and-effect relationship between switch states and visual states.

In such hybrid networks, it is imperative to intelligently plan the trajectory of UAVs by exploiting the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique and direct optical wireless communication (OWC) technology to ensure timely data collection. However, the traditional DRL technique suffers from issues such as sparse rewards and low sampling efficiency, which leads to a decrease in the freshness of data. To address these issues, in this paper, we investigate the trajectory planning problem for swarms of UAVs conducting data collection with age of information awareness. Leveraging the prior knowledge of large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent reinforcement learning technique, we propose a novel multi-UAV maritime data collection scheme. Firstly, we extract the prior knowledge strategies of LLMs in the form of expert trajectories through structured prompts. Then, initial strategy models are rapidly generated for UAVs through multi-agent behavior cloning method, which reduce ineffective exploration and accelerates learning.

However, the challenge of efficiently and economically constructing reliable wide-area quantum networks remains unresolved. This problem, termed network planning, is typically modeled as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. Existing solver-based solutions for classical networks face scalability issues, while heuristic approaches that sacrifice optimality for scalability heavily rely on human expertise and lack generalizability. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated potential in adaptive decision-making for classical network planning. However, quantum networks introduce unique constraints due to their end-to-end entanglement distribution requirements. To address this, we propose a two-stage quantum network resource allocation framework, QPLAN, that combines multi-agent DRL with traditional optimization solvers. Our approach uses a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning strategy using graph neural networks (GNNs) and transformers for traffic flow and corresponding hardware resource allocation to minimize hardware cost while cooperatively satisfying problem constraints as much as possible. The output of the DRL algorithm is then used as an initial input to prune the solution space, ""warm-starting"" the ILP solver and further improving the solution. This hybrid approach effectively reduces manual effort and enhances scalability. Experimental results show that our method yields near-optimal solutions with better scalability than only using ILP solvers.","","979-8-3315-3159-1","10.1109/QCNC64685.2025.00063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11000144","Quantum Networks;Network Planning;Reinforcement Learning","Scalability;Feature extraction;Deep reinforcement learning;Transformers;Hardware;Planning;Quantum networks;Resource management;Reliability;Optimization","","","","21","IEEE","15 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent advances in robotic manipulation hold the potential to automate the tying process, yet face challenges in accurately estimating tying poses in congested rebar nodes. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid perception and motion planning approach that integrates geometry-based perception with Equivariant Denoising Diffusion on SE(3) (Diffusion-EDFs) to enable robust multi-node rebar tying with minimal training data. Our perception module utilizes density-based clustering (DBSCAN), geometry-based node feature extraction, and principal component analysis (PCA) to segment rebar bars, identify rebar nodes, and estimate orientation vectors for sequential ranking, even in complex, unstructured environments. The motion planner, based on Diffusion-EDFs, is trained on as few as 5–10 demonstrations to generate sequential end-effector poses that optimize collision avoidance and tying efficiency. The proposed system is validated on various rebar meshes, including single-layer, multi-layer, and cluttered configurations, demonstrating high success rates in node detection and accurate sequential tying. Compared with conventional approaches that rely on large datasets or extensive manual parameter tuning, our method achieves robust, efficient, and adaptable multi-node tying while significantly reducing data requirements. This result underscores the potential of hybrid perception and diffusion-driven planning to enhance automation in on-site construction tasks, improving both safety and labor efficiency.","2161-8089","979-8-3315-2246-9","10.1109/CASE58245.2025.11163814","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11163814","","Automation;Accuracy;Training data;Feature extraction;Vectors;Planning;Safety;Tuning;Principal component analysis;Sorting","","","","22","IEEE","23 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents the design of a novel artificial muscle utilizing a single wire of shape memory alloy (SMA) wound in a spiral pattern. The actuator consists of two spiral windings of a single continuous SMA wire in two parallel plans (plan A and Plan B). Two groups of roller bearings are arranged in two halves of hexagons shapes for the guidance of the SMA wire in the two spiral shapes, enabling SMA spiral winding, while a third group of roller bearings are movable in middle output stage. This output stage is strategically placed between the two SMA spirals, enabling output motion. When the SMA wire is heated, it contracts, resulting in linear motion of the movable part along the axle (maximum stroke of 25 mm, and maximum load of 7 kgf). The displacement and force exerted by the actuator are adapted by adjusting the length of the SMA wire and the configuration of the output pulleys. Upon cooling, the movable part returns to its initial position under external loading. Moreover, system identification and PID control techniques are employed to enhance the actuator's control performance. Experimental tests conducted in both open-loop and closed-loop controls validate the actuator's ability to successfully follow desired trajectories. The key contribution of this work lies in the novel spiral architecture, which offers a vital and practical solution to deal with the limitations related to size and strain of the SMA wire while leveraging the unique properties of SMA technology.","2642-3901","978-89-93215-27-4","10.23919/ICCAS59377.2023.10316801","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10316801","Shape memory alloy;linear actuator;artificial muscle;bio-inspired actuator;trajectory control","Artificial muscles;Actuators;Spirals;Shape;Shape memory alloys;Pulleys;Wires","","1","","24","","20 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One class of cognitive bias deals with the ordering of items or interactions: information presented last among a grouping is most salient in memory formation (recency bias), followed by information presented first (primacy bias), followed by information in the middle, collectively known as the serial-position effect. For example, if a human’s last observation of a robot involves a task failure, this will disproportionately negatively alter their perception of the robot’s competence, as well as their trust in the robot moving forward. It is valuable to characterize the effect of these biases within human-robot interactions to inform strategies for risk-aware planning that cultivate appropriate levels of human trust. We conducted a human-subjects study (n=53) testing the influence of the serial-position effect on recalled competence (see overview at https://youtu.be/BgH2zhh1s48). Participants viewed videos of a robot performing the same tasks at the same level of competence, with task order differing by experimental condition (rising competence, falling competence, or failures at the midpoint), asking participants to rate robot competence in between every video as well at the very end of the experiment. We found that while the average between-video rating of robot competence remained stable across conditions, the recalled, post-experiment ratings of competence and trust were significantly lower in the condition with decreasing competence than in either of the other two conditions, suggesting a notable recency bias. We conclude with implications for human-subjects experiment design (i.e., how subjective measures are influenced by ordering effects) and provide design recommendations to minimize them. We further discuss practical applications of these results in creating risk-aware robotic planners capable of trust calibration.","","979-8-3503-8457-4","10.1109/ICRA57147.2024.10611334","Arm; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10611334","","Human-robot interaction;Calibration;Planning;History;Task analysis;Robots;Videos","","1","","34","IEEE","8 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to solve the computationally expensive path-planning problem in a reasonable time, we created a two-level optimization approach with heuristics. At the outer level, the UGV route is parameterized by considering which set of locations to visit in the scenario and the UGV wait times to recharge UAVs and at the inner level, the UAV route is solved by formulating and solving a vehicle routing problem with capacity constraints, time windows, and dropped visits. The UGV free parameters need to be optimized judiciously in order to create high quality solutions. We explore two methods for tuning the free UGV parameters: (1) a Genetic Algorithm (GA), and (2) Asynchronous Multi-agent architecture (A-teams). The A-teams uses multiple agents to create, improve, and destroy solutions. The parallel asynchronous architecture enables A-teams to quickly optimize the parameters.

In this paper, we propose a distributed control architecture based on multi-agent systems (MASs) to assist the SDN controller in the control of network services near-real-time. Per-traffic flow telemetry data are collected from the packet nodes, distributed through the agents in the control plane, and analyzed to assure performance and to anticipate any degradation. Measurements feed flow agents, which are based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models, to make routing decisions aiming at ensuring flow performance. In the case when QoS degradation is detected, we propose algorithms to analyze its cause, which can be a result of some bottleneck in the network. We show how the latter is detected and additional capacity is requested of the SDN controller, which in turn creates an optical bypass to provide additional capacity. The proposed solution is demonstrated experimentally on a federated testbed connecting UPC and CNIT premises. Focused first on the control plane, the feasibility of the proposed architecture and workflows is experimentally assessed. After that, the performance of the near-real-time operation is evaluated at the data plane to verify that the maximum e2e delay is not exceeded for multiple flows, showing the effectiveness of predictive QoS evaluation together with infrastructure and service reconfiguration.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.533789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10906307","","Delays;Routing;Quality of service;Telemetry;Costs;Optical packet switching;Distributed databases;Computer architecture;Pipelines;Degradation","","3","","","","26 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The uniqueness of UAVs in systems creates a novel set of trajectory or path planning and coordination problems. Environments include many more points of interest (POIs) than UAVs, with obstacles and no-fly zones. We introduce REPlanner, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm inspired by economic transactions to distribute tasks among UAVs. This system revolves around an economic theory, in particular an auction mechanism where UAVs trade assigned POIs. We formulate the path planning problem as a multi-agent economic game, where agents can cooperate and compete for resources. We then translate the problem into a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which is solved using a reinforcement learning (RL) model deployed on each agent.

The system uses a probabilistic ensemble-based interaction mechanism to evaluate epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, as well as dynamically changes the job reassignment frequency depending on environmental unpredictability, to provide adaptive coordination.

Traditional dispatch methods rely on manual experience, which is inefficient and prone to errors. Conversely, applying general artificial intelligence, such as large language models (LLMs), directly to this safety-critical domain poses fundamental risks of factual hallucination and unreliable actions. The Mingyue system overcomes these challenges through three key innovations: 1) A unified knowledge representation framework for power dispatch that transforms vast, heterogeneous domain knowledge (e.g., regulations, case studies, and operational procedures) into a machine-readable and traceable knowledge base, providing a reliable foundation for all decisions. 2) A decoupled ‘Intent-Plan-Tool’ architecture that leverages LLMs for task planning while invoking a deterministic professional toolset for execution, fundamentally isolating the non-deterministic nature of AI from the precise control required in the physical world. 3) A hierarchical multi-agent collaborative mechanism for complex dispatch workflows, which automates end-to-end tasks through the coordination of specialized agents (e.g., safety supervision, decision-making, and operation agents). The system has been deployed in the Guangdong power grid, the world's largest provincial grid. Experimental results show that compared to traditional manual modes and standalone AI tools, Mingyue improves efficiency by over 85 % in key tasks such as risk analysis, emergency response, and operational ticket generation, significantly enhancing the safety and intelligence of power grid operations.","","979-8-3315-3774-6","10.1109/PSGEC66102.2025.11150990","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72331009,72171206,92270105); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11150990","Multi-Agent Systems;Human-AI Collaboration;Power System Dispatch;Decision-Making;Large Language Models;Safety-Critical Systems","Technological innovation;Uncertainty;Large language models;Decision making;Collaboration;Transforms;Power grids;Risk analysis;Reliability;Multi-agent systems","","","","15","IEEE","11 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present an end to end AI augmented auditing framework that leverages a multi-agent pipeline for comprehensive vulnerability detection and automated exploit generation. First, we review existing approaches such as static analysis, fuzzing, symbolic execution, formal verification, and machine learning methods, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and real world deployment experience. Building on this survey, we introduce a multi agent architecture composed of a Distributor Agent, an Attack Planner Agent, an Exploit Generator Agent, and an Audit Report Generator Agent. The pipeline ingests smart contract source code, documen-tation, and test suites to outline stepwise attack strategies and synthesize ready to compile Solidity exploit code. Exploits are compiled and validated in a containerized environment, enabling automated verification of attack effectiveness. We outline a validation strategy for future work, more specifically, applying the pipeline to capture the flag challenges and online bug bounty platforms, and we describe plans for prompt fine tuning, retrieval augmented generation, and formal verification integration to further enhance detection accuracy and exploit reliability.

First, in a nominal setting, the analytical form of our CaRT safety filter formally ensures safe maneuvers of nonlinear multi-agent systems, optimally with minimal deviation from the learning-based policy. Second, in off-nominal settings, the analytical form of our CaRT robust filter optimally tracks the certified safe trajectory, generated by the previous layer in the hierarchy, the CaRT safety filter. We show using contraction theory that CaRT guarantees safety and the exponential boundedness of the trajectory tracking error, even under the presence of deterministic and stochastic disturbance. Also, the hierarchical nature of CaRT enables enhancing its robustness for safety just by its superior tracking to the certified safe trajectory, thereby making it suitable for off-nominal scenarios with large disturbances. This is a major distinction from conventional safety function-driven approaches, where the robustness originates from the stability of a safe set, which could pull the system over-conservatively to the interior of the safe set. Our log-barrier formulation in CaRT allows for its distributed implementation in multi-agent settings.

Network planning, which plans for network resources and architecture to improve the network performance and save operational costs, is crucial for satellite network management. However, due to the large scale of mega-constellations, high dynamics of satellites, and complex distribution of real-world traffic, it is extremely challenging to conduct scalable network planning on mega-constellations with high performance. In this paper, we propose SATFLOW, a distributed and hierarchical network planning framework to plan for the network topology, traffic allocation, and fine-grained ISL terminal power allocation for mega-constellations. To tackle the hardness of the original problem, we decompose the grand problem into two hierarchical sub-problems, tackled by two-tier modules. A multi-agent reinforcement learning approach is proposed for the upper-level module so that the overall laser energy consumption and ISL operational costs can be minimized; A distributed alternating step algorithm is proposed for the lower-level module so that the laser energy consumption could be minimized with low time complexity for a given topology. Extensive simulations on various mega-constellations validate SATFLOW's scalability on the constellation size, reducing the flow violation ratio by up to $21.0 \%$ and reducing the total costs by up to $89.4 \%$, compared with various state-of-the-art benchmarks.","2643-3303","979-8-3503-5171-2","10.1109/ICNP61940.2024.10858566","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10858566","LEO mega-constellations;network planning;multi-agent reinforcement learning;temporal graph learning;distributed optimization","Energy consumption;Costs;Satellites;Network topology;Scalability;Lasers;Low earth orbit satellites;Planning;Resource management;Optimization","","","","45","IEEE","4 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The collaboration of vehicles necessitates the exchange of environmental and decision information, generating massive collaborative computing tasks with strict latency requirements. Leveraging mobile edge computing (MEC) technology, computing tasks can be processed near the vehicles to reduce latency. However, traffic congestion and computational load imbalance seriously affect traffic efficiency and computational latency. In hybrid driving scenarios, it is challenging to fulfill the diverse service requirements of vehicles with different intelligence levels. Moreover, non-collaborative tend to result in traffic congestion due to vehicle aggregation effects, while centralized solutions lack flexibility and have high computational complexity. To address these concerns, a distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (DMARL) algorithm is proposed for collaborative path planning and scheduling in a blockchain-based collaboration framework. In this framework, we model the communication, traffic situation and task processing of the system and formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize both travel time and computation latency. Last, we convert the scheduling problem for different types of vehicles into Markov decision processes (MDPs) and propose Q-learning-based DMARL algorithm to achieve proactive load balancing of both road infrastructures and MEC nodes (MECNs).

The paper proposed a promising type of hybrid robotic fish (HRF), which can realize two kinds of motion modes on the sea surface. Firstly, the configuration and dynamic model of the HRF were analyzed elaborately. Then, to realize accurate velocity prediction under two kinds of motion modes of HRF, the influence factors are presented in a complex marine environment. Based on the influence factors to its maneuverability, such as wind or wave parameters, a velocity prediction algorithm based on back-propagation neural network (BPNN) was introduced. However, BPNN has the disadvantages of extended learning and training time, easily falling into local optimum. Then we found that genetic algorithm (GA), which is a kind of evolutionary algorithm, is suitable for our problem. Therefore, the accuracy and efficiency of the prediction algorithm were improved by adopting the genetic algorithm to optimize the weight and threshold of BPNN. Taking the experimental data from the pool test, the back-propagation neural network with genetic algorithm (GA-BPNN) forecasting model was established. Besides, the other prediction methods were compared and evaluated under the same assessment criterion to validate the proposed forecasting model. The experimental results demonstrate that the GA-BPNN model has higher accuracy and efficiency compared with other prediction algorithms, which verifies the feasibility of the velocity prediction model for hybrid robotic fish in complex ocean environments.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3002928","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9119073","Back-propagation neural network;genetic algorithm;hybrid robotic fish;velocity forecasting","Force;Robots;Genetic algorithms;Forecasting;Predictive models;Neural networks;Prediction algorithms","","35","","30","CCBY","16 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It integrates grasp pose estimation, end-effector pose evaluation, and motion planning of the robotic arm into a single model, enhancing the success rate while reducing computational load. We present a closed-loop grasp control system based on deep reinforcement learning. This control system can perform grasp tasks while dynamically adjusting to avoid end-effector collisions. The design of hybrid-action reinforcement learning module is trained with unified latent action space and further improve generalization, achieving real-time autonomous grasp control. Real robot experiments show that our method has 74.2% success rate for grasping 7 unseen objects. Comparative experiments show that the proposed HAGrasp outperforms open-loop baseline Contact-Graspnet in both success rate and inference time. It is demonstrated that with integrated multi-view input and sim-to-real training design, our method improves real-world applications of autonomous grasp.","","979-8-3503-8457-4","10.1109/ICRA57147.2024.10610852","National Science and Technology Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10610852","","Training;Point cloud compression;Robot control;Pose estimation;Deep reinforcement learning;End effectors;Real-time systems","","","","36","IEEE","8 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"RT-TelSurg: Real Time Telesurgery Using SDN, Fog, and Cloud as Infrastructures","S. Sedaghat; A. H.

In telesurgery, the patient's vital signs and status and the required robotic commands during the surgery should be received on time. Otherwise, the life of the patient or the safety of the operation is endangered. Hence, transmitted packets should meet their respective relative deadlines. Software-defined networking is a relatively new architecture for computer and telecommunications networks in which the network control plane is separated from the data plane. One way to achieve real time telesurgery is to employ cloud and fog networks using SDN as infrastructure. By using a real time cloud controller in the SDN as the core and a fog controller on the edge of the network on the master (physician) side, one may satisfy the acceptable level of the timing constraints of the telesurgery. Accordingly, based on the presented architecture, we develop the statistical performance model of our proposed approach, RT-TelSurg. This statistical queuing theory model is designed for critical and non-critical states of the network. Based on these states, network resources are allocated to telesurgery data in both modes, and a computational bottleneck is detected. RT-TelSurg is evaluated according to real time and surgery efficiency parameters. The results show that the average deadline hit ratio is 98.2% in different conditions, which is quite acceptable for telesurgery applications.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3069744","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9389710","Real time;telesurgery;SDN;cloud;fog;statistical modeling;timing scheduling algorithm","Real-time systems;Surgery;Delays;Cloud computing;Scheduling algorithms;Medical services;Computer architecture","","24","","65","CCBY","30 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Self-adaptation in robotics can, among others, take the form of changing a robot’s task plan or its software architecture at runtime. The latter has shown to be effective in satisfying quality requirements such as minimizing energy consumption and operating safely. However, most self-adaptive robotic systems perform architecture-based self-adaptation to meet the functional goal of completing an assigned mission. Additionally, the mechanisms to accomplish architectural adaptations are mostly adhoc and not oriented towards reuse. We in turn investigate how quality requirements and architecture-based self-adaptation can be facilitated in robotics software while integrating into existing practices to promote practitioners’ adoption and reuse. To this end, we design and implement an extension to the Behavior Trees (BTs) task plan formalism which introduces an explicit consideration of quality requirements. Additionally, we implement a general architectural adaptation layer for ROS2 systems and an extension to BTs which showcases its utilization. Finally, we perform quantitative experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in satisfying quality requirements via architectural adaptation on a mobile terrestrial robot. We find our approach to be an effective means to address a variety of self-adaptation scenarios within the mission of the system.","","979-8-3503-6387-6","10.1109/ACSOS61780.2024.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10771284","robotics;self-adaptation;behavior trees;quality","Adaptation models;Energy consumption;Runtime;Software architecture;Buildings;Software;Libraries;Distributed computing;Robots;Standards","","2","","26","IEEE","2 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we propose a system with a hierarchical planner, which solves the task and motion problem and optimizes for a subsequent parallelization. We use action models based on a constraint formulation; thus, the execution engine can parallelize the sequential plan without synchronization between different tasks.

Whereas previous missions used Sequence Generator (SeqGen) to validate their command load, Mars2020 chose to adapt software originally developed for Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), Surface Simulation (SSim), in order to meet new mission performance requirements. This decision meant a complete redesign of the surface mission uplink commanding validation architecture, but it also provided room for meaningful improvements. SSim is a Flight Software (FSW)-in-the-loop sequence and command simulator, enabling much faster than real-time execution. It was originally developed for MSL Rover Planners to simulate and validate their commanding of rover mobility, robotic arm, and sampling activities. For Mars2020, SSim has since been expanded to include the modeling of system-level functions such as power, telecommunications, and instruments. It affords the operations team the ability to simulate commanding in a very flight-like manner, a significant change from the heritage process involving the use of SeqGen. Using a FSW-in-the-loop simulator for uplink command validation provides several key advantages over heritage simulation tools. Because of the similarity between SSim and the rover FSW, the Mars2020 validation process is able to routinely incorporate the latest known state of the flight vehicle into the validation tools, ensuring that the simulation and validation initial condition used in uplink planning is the best possible representation of the onboard state. A set of new tools and new and improved processes developed for Mars2020 enable this usage of flight vehicle state in uplink planning, and by doing so, prevent divergence between spacecraft state tracked on the ground and the real state of the rover on Mars. The adoption of SSim for uplink command validation completely redesigned the surface validation process. The development of this design presented many novel challenges resulting in key decisions and trades that could not directly leverage heritage designs or experience. This study will discuss the formulation of, and key decisions involved in, the Mars2020 surface validation process architecture in hopes of serving as a blueprint for future missions.","1095-323X","978-1-6654-3760-8","10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9843722","","Space vehicles;Mars;Computer architecture;Downlink;Software;Planning;Health and safety","","","","5","IEEE","10 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Real-time (re)planning is essential to ensure the task can still be achieved when subtasks execution suffers from uncertainty or when the master task changes intermittently requiring real-time reconfiguration of the plan. In this article, we develop a supervisory control architecture tailored to the cooperation of two robotic manipulators equipped with standard pick-and-place facilities in the plane. We control the planar position and orientation of an object using two underactuated manipulators so that only the position of the object can be controlled directly. The desired orientation follows from the accumulation of alternating relative angles. A time-invariant policy function is trained using deep reinforcement learning, which can determine a finite sequence of pick-and-place maneuvers to manipulate the object to a desired configuration. Two policy architectures are compared. The first uses the kinematic model to determine the final step, whilst the second policy makes this decision itself. The more information is given to the policy, the easier it trains. In return, it becomes less adaptable and loses some of its generalizability.","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2022.3175484","Flemish Government (AI Research Program); Flanders Make (Multi Systems Learning Control); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9788476","Cooperation;multiagent manipulation;pick-and-place;reinforcement learning;robotics","Manipulators;Robots;Task analysis;Aerospace electronics;Robot kinematics;Supervisory control;Real-time systems","","9","","20","IEEE","3 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Phenomena of interest include flows or variations in volatiles, gas composition or concentration, particulate density, or even simply temperature. Improved measurement of these processes enables understanding of exotic geologies and distributions or correlating indicators of trapped water or biological activity. However, such data is often needed in unsafe areas such as caves, lava tubes, or steep ravines not easily reached by current spacecraft and planetary robots. To address this capability gap, we have developed miniaturized, expendable sensors which can be ballistically lobbed from a robotic rover or static lander - or even dropped during a flyover. These projectiles can perform sensing during flight and after anchoring to terrain features. By augmenting exploration systems with these sensors, we can extend situational awareness, perform long-duration monitoring, and reduce utilization of primary mobility resources, all of which are crucial in surface missions. We call the integrated payload that includes a cold gas launcher, smart projectiles, planning software, network discovery, and science sensing: PHALANX. In this paper, we introduce the mission architecture for PHALANX and describe an exploration concept that pairs projectile sensors with a rover “mothership.” Science use cases explored include reconnaissance using ballistic cameras, volatiles detection, and building timelapse maps of temperature and illumination conditions. Strategies to autonomously coordinate constellations of deployed sensors to self-discover and localize with peer ranging (i.e. a “local GPS”) are summarized, thus providing communications infrastructure beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) of the rover. Capabilities were demonstrated through both simulation and physical testing with a terrestrial prototype. The approach to developing a terrestrial prototype is discussed, including design of the launching mechanism, projectile optimization, micro-electronics fabrication, and sensor selection. Results from early testing and characterization of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components are reported. Nodes were subjected to successful burn-in tests over 48 hours at full logging duty cycle. Integrated field tests were conducted in the Roverscape, a half-acre planetary analog environment at NASA Ames, where we tested up to 10 sensor nodes simultaneously coordinating with an exploration rover. Ranging accuracy has been demonstrated to be within +/−10cm over 20m using commodity radios when compared to high-resolution laser scanner ground truthing. Evolution of the design, including progressive miniaturization of the electronics and iterated modifications of the enclosure housing for streamlining and optimized radio performance are described. Finally, lessons learned to date, gaps toward eventual flight mission implementation, and continuing future development plans are discussed.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-2734-7","10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172595","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9172595","","Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Projectiles;Robot kinematics;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Robot sensing systems;Extraterrestrial measurements;Distance measurement;Sensors;Payloads","","3","","24","IEEE","21 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper introduces a novel twophase hybrid framework combining reinforcement learning and convex optimization to generate diverse, smooth, and collision-free paths. The first phase, which constitutes the core contribution, employs a Q-learning-based method on a visibility graph to learn an adaptive policy that generalizes across multiple start-goal pairs and varying environmental complexities. This approach enables path diversity, robust obstacle avoidance, and environment-specific adaptation without relying on hand-crafted heuristics. The second phase refines these initial trajectories using Multi-agent Interleaving Convex Optimization (MICO) to improve curvature, length, and clearance. Experimental results demonstrate that MICO outperforms baseline convex optimization methods and provides flexible tuning of path characteristics through multiobjective optimization. The paths are represented as piecewise Bézier curves, ensuring smooth and feasible motion for multi-agent navigation.","2770-4815","979-8-3503-5710-3","10.1109/IRCE66030.2025.11203139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11203139","Multi-agent Path Optimization;Q-learning;Piecewise Quadratic Bézier Path;Visibility Graph;Adaptive Path Planning;Convex Optimization","Q-learning;Navigation;Trajectory tracking;Diversity reception;Convex functions;Hybrid power systems;Collision avoidance;Robots;Tuning;Trajectory optimization","","","","34","IEEE","23 Oct 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For decision-making of robotic systems to improve operational efficiency, safety, and/or mission success rate, they involve both discrete variables representing task allocation or transitions between discrete modes and continuous variables representing trajectories of the planned motion or states governed by differential equations. This paper formulates a class of mixed-type decision-making problems with polynomial objective and constraints as quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problems and a nonconvex optimization method based on alternating direction method of multipliers is proposed to solve the QCQP. The proposed optimization method consists of three sequential subproblems, all of which admit closed-form solutions. Moreover, convergence proof of the optimization algorithm is provided. Two representative problems, traveling salesman with obstacle avoidance and rendezvous and docking of a charging station with distinct phase constraints, are described and solved via the proposed method.

However, under non-ideal environments, the autonomous human-machine interaction of manipulators is still a challenging problem. Moreover, despite numerous advanced methods for environmental perception and planning control, deploying these intricate methods directly to manipulators with limited resources remains difficult. This paper proposes Doodbot, an edge computing assisted manipulator system for human-machine chess-playing. Under the hood, Doodbot makes a geometric model for the manipulator and adopts a model predictive control method to realize the rolling optimal control of the manipulator. Furthermore, Doodbot deploys a hybrid chess-board recognition algorithm combining traditional line detection and convolutional neural network-based image recognition, thus enjoying both the adaptiveness of the conventional method and the high recognition performance of the deep neural network. These computing tasks are offloaded to an edge node in proximity for computing capability augmentation, avoiding long-delayed execution on resource-limited manipulators. The feasibility and robustness of Doodbot are verified through realistic prototype system implementation. The experimental results show that Doodbot has improved the accuracy of chessboard perception by up to 31%. In addition, it can also correctly plan the motion trajectory of the robotic arm and reduce control errors by 36%.

For many existing systems, an unexpected change in mission specification, component failures, or energy conservation requires downtime for adaption (redesign of mission logic, switching sensor data processing pipeline, etc.). This is because software and hardware components for robotic applications are commonly chosen or designed based on task requirements and integrated either directly in the source code or via system configuration scripts, such as ROS launch files, leading to a fixed monolithic design. As the necessity and extent of adaptive behaviors is not always known prior to deployment, the structure of a robot’s software needs to support it by design. In this paper, we propose TeMoto, a novel architecture for adaptive autonomous robots, and a ROS-based framework of openly available software tools that implement the TeMoto architecture. TeMoto is a developer tool which combines dynamic (run-time) task and resource management, encourages modular and scalable system design and is task and platform agnostic - TeMoto provides the foundation for an adaptive robotic system. The feasibility of the TeMoto framework is qualitatively assessed via experiments on single and multi-robot setups spanning common scenarios (teleoperation, autonomous surveillance, cargo delivery, etc.).

To solve this problem, we investigate the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO)-based CPP scheme. In specific, the CPP problem is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Since the path planning of the AUVs is not only related to the local information but also the other AUVs' information, the information should be shared among AUVs based on the UCDNs.

The modules have limited computational capabilities, interact only with neighboring modules, and can move around adjacent modules from a cell to an empty neighboring cell under specific conditions. An important well-studied problem for these robotic systems is Motion Planning, also known as Shape Formationor Self-reconfiguration, requiring the modules to organize themselves into a pre-determined final configuration (i.e., shape); basic shapes such as the line (or chain) are especially important as they are utilized as a foundation for constructing more complicated shapes and are an initial measure for handling complicated tasks. A metamorphic robots system could offer a higher degree of reliability and robustness compared to fixed-architecture robots due to its capacity to self-repair: should some modules fail and no longer move, the shape could be reconstructed by the non-faulty modules. To do this correctly, efficiently, and without restricting the autonomy of the modules is a non-trivial task. In this paper, we study the Line Recoveryproblem, requiring the non-faulty modules to reconstruct the line without violation of connectivity requirements at any time during the recovery procedure.

Such systems are characterized by close interactions, or even collaborations, between hardware and machinery on the one hand, and humans on the other. Furthermore, as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in general and robotic applications in particular typically operate in an emergent environment, unanticipated events may occur during their operation, making the need for runtime monitoring support a crucial yet often time-consuming task. Runtime monitoring typically requires establishing support for collecting data, aggregating and transporting the data to a monitoring framework for persistence and further processing, and finally, performing checks of functional and non-functional properties. In this paper, we present our initial efforts towards a flexible monitoring framework for ROS-based systems. We report on challenges for establishing runtime monitoring support and present our preliminary architecture that aims to significantly reduce the setup and maintenance effort when creating monitors and establishing constraint checks.","","978-1-4503-9317-1","10.1145/3526071.3527515","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9814830","ROS;Cyber-Physical Systems;Runtime Monitoring","Runtime;Databases;Maintenance engineering;Hardware;Manufacturing;Task analysis;Machinery","","4","","19","","11 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The brain activity is solely used to generate commands that can be recognized by the computer. To generate a recognizable brain activity, usually the subject imagines the movements of one's limbs without performing any real movement. In the literature, this paradigm is called Motor Imagery (MI). The subject provides data through a particular recording technology, such as EEG, in a certain time frame, in which the subject forces himself/herself into the feeling of performing a particular action. Each recorded data is linked to a label, and different techniques are used to learn patterns, in order to map them correctly. The goal of this paper is to investigate, whether it is possible to generate similar results as in the case of imagining the movement of limbs, by imagining the movement of an external object. To investigate this, we compare the performance of Motor Imagery and Object Motor Imagery. In the first case the mental task consists of imagining the movements of arms, while in the second the imagining of moving an external box through solely brain activity. A video of a box that moves through a plane in two directions, right, left, is used as visual feedback in both cases. The recorded EEG data are split into training and testing subsets, and are fed to a deep neural network, that tries to learn the different patterns and to classify them. The results show that Object Motor Imagery can achieve better results compared to MI, despite the lack of embodiment and congruity with any daily neural command. The trained architecture is used to control a mobile humanoid, investigating the implementation of Object Motor Movement in robotic application.","","978-1-6654-8641-5","10.1109/ICCR55715.2022.10053905","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10053905","Brain-Computer Interface;deep learning;object motor imagery;humanoid robot","Training;Brain;Visualization;Image recognition;Humanoid robots;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces","","2","","15","IEEE","6 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, the autonomous robotic system takes physical and operational constraints into account to perform the demands of a specific visual servoing task in a way to minimize a cost function. A hierarchical control architecture is developed based on interwoven integration of a variant of the iterative closest point image registration, a constrained noise-adaptive Kalman filter, a fault detection logic and recovery system, together with a constrained optimal path planner. The dynamic estimator estimates unknown states and uncertain parameters required for motion prediction while imposing a set of inequality constraints for consistency of the estimation process and adjusting adaptively the Kalman filter parameters in the face of unexpected vision errors. It is followed by the implementation of a fault recovery strategy based on a fault detection logic that monitors the health of the visual feedback using the metric fit error of the image registration. Subsequently, the estimated/predicted pose and parameters are passed to an optimal path planner in order to bring the robot end-effector to the grasping point of a moving target as quickly as possible subject to multiple constraints, such as acceleration limit, smooth capture, and line-of-sight angle of the target.

The information that the VIPER rover provides will help improve understanding of the composition, distribution, and accessibility of Lunar polar volatiles and will help determine how the Moon's resources can support future human space exploration. VIPER, however, represents a radical departure from the way that NASA has traditionally developed planetary robotic missions. A key consequence of these differences is that estimating the cost of VIPER's rover software is challenging and complex. For example, VIPER is being developed using management procedures typically applied to NASA research and technology projects, rather than space flight programs. In addition, key portions of the rover's software are being designed as ground software to run on mission control computers (rather than onboard the rover as flight software as with prior planetary missions) taking advantage of continuous, interactive data communications between the Moon and Earth and higher performance computing available on the ground. Moreover, the rover's software is being engineered using Agile software development practices and incorporates a significant amount of open-source code, rather than following traditional (spiral, waterfall, etc.) development methods and in-house code. In this paper, we present an innovative process to estimate the life cycle cost of VIPER's rover software. We first describe how we modeled the architecture and code counts for three software elements: Rover Flight Software (RFSW), Rover Ground Software (RGSW), and Rover Simulation Software (RSIM). We then discuss key challenges and unique aspects of our approach, such as the lack of Lunar rover analogies, the need to integrate and test large open source software, and the strategies developed to account for use of non-space flight management practices and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conclude with a summary of our results, including cumulative distribution, nearest neighbors and cluster analysis, as well as heuristics used to confirm the reasonableness of the cost estimate.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-7436-5","10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9438347","software cost estimation;software sizing;software estimating methodologies;parametric modeling;independent cost estimate;flight software;Lunar rover","Space vehicles;Moon;NASA;Open source software;Robots;Software development management","","2","","15","IEEE","7 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If not cleaned regularly, this can lead to increased sailing resistance and fuel consumption, thereby reducing the ship's energy efficiency. Manual cleaning faces issues such as long cleaning times and operational hazards, resulting in significant time and labor costs. To tackle this issue, The present study presents a cable-driven cleaning robot, which incorporates a cable-driven parallel robot as its fundamental framework, along with a high-pressure water jet serving as the actuator, thereby creating a hybrid robotic system. First, the dynamic model of this system is established using the Lagrangian method. Building on this model, a Fuzzy-PID control strategy is proposed, enabling accurate trajectory tracking. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, numerical simulations are performed as a final step. The outcomes of the simulation indicate that, when contrasted with the conventional PID control approach, the proposed Fuzzy-PID control strategy significantly improves control accuracy and exhibits superior performance in terms of stability. The cable-driven cleaning robot and its control strategy presented in this paper offer a theoretical basis and practical support for applications in the domain of ship cleaning.

To obtain a clear view of the ultrasound image, an examiner needs to press the ultrasound (US) probe with a constant press and move smoothly and continuously. To mitigate the workload and prepare the remote treatment, there has been a demand for an automatic diagnostic scanning robotic system (ADSRS) using US images. For the complete ADSRS, the target localization, path planning, robot control, and US image analysis need to be addressed. This paper explains mainly the robot control part as the preliminary research toward ADSRS. A simple path was selected within a predefined inspection area as the preliminary work and the selected path was converted from the camera coordinates into the robot coordinates. Both the position and orientation of the US probe were used as the desired path. For the robot control, hybrid force-positon control was implemented to guarantee the quality of US images and the safety of patients. For the position control, the built-in Cartesian impedance control and null space control were utilized to control the 7-degree-of-ffeedom (7-DOF) manipulator. For the force control, the basic proportional control was implemented, and it was integrated with the aforementioned position control system. The experimental evaluation was conducted by using a 7-DOF manipulator with a joint torque sensor at each joint after attaching a US probe and a 3-dimensional (3-D) camera to an end-effector. The simple path over the surface of the skin of the patient was generated successfully, and the desired force during movement was set to 5N. The error is measured to $0.3144\pm 0.4853$ N.

We present an implementation for path planning via a propagating wavefront on 3D environments. The algorithm operates on a Spiking Neural Network of excitatory place cells structured as a grid. A wavefront travelling through the network is initiated by activating the goal place cell. The wave strengthens synapses in the direction of the propagation using STDP, as a synaptic learning rule. By interpreting the synaptic weights as a vector field, a path can be derived from any place cell, reached by the wave, to the destination. We demonstrate, using a neural simulator, that our algorithm works well on maps with multiple obstacles. Our method allows fast simulation and query times and we expect to considerably improve the network creation time by using dedicated hardware, allowing massive parallelism.

Ultrasound (US) imaging is commonly used to guide the needle to the kidney during this procedure. However, it requires an advanced level of dexterity to coordinate the US probe and the needle to keep the needle visible in the images at all times. Failure to maintain needle-probe alignment can result in inadvertent injury, bleeding, and other complications. The use of robotic assistance can alleviate the surgeon’s cognitive workload by enabling autonomous positioning of the US probe and accurate needle tracking. This paper presents a new US-guided visual servoing (VS) algorithm for needle tracking using longitudinal US images of a needle subjected to out-of-plane motion. The ultrasound probe can move in 4 degrees-of-freedom (DOF), that is, two translations and one rotation in the imaging plane, and one rotation out of the imaging plane. Unlike previously reported VS algorithms, 4-DOF tracking is achieved using only 2D-US images and without any additional position sensor or prior knowledge of the needle trajectory. The algorithm is validated extensively in three different experimental scenarios using a water tank, a tissue phantom, and ex-vivo porcine tissue. Results obtained from several trials confirm the algorithm’s ability to track the needle and maintain needle-probe alignment with an average error of 1.5 mm, despite an out-of-plane average needle deflection of 7 mm along a 60 mm insertion depth.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3562078","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(grant numbers:ALLRP 580714-22); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10967380","Medical robotics;needle tracking;percutaneous nephrolithotomy;robot-assisted surgery;tool tracking;ultrasound imaging;visual servoing","Needles;Imaging;Shafts;Probes;Robots;Robot sensing systems;Trajectory;Kidney;Real-time systems;Visualization","","2","","64","CCBY","17 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The primary objective of this rover is to provide assistance in diverse exploration activities and experimental endeavors, all while prioritizing the safety of the expedition team. The mission concept involves the utilization of a transportation rover to reach a specified destination. Subsequently, astronauts will be accompanied by an assistant rover to conduct site exploration. The human explorers will focus their investigations on the relatively accessible and safe regions, while the rover will traverse the more complex and hazardous terrains.As the knowledge of the red planet deepens, it is becoming apparent that many high value science targets are either craters, caves, steep hills or valleys, locations inaccessible to the conventional rocker bogie mobility systems. This paper presents a novel rover design featuring a modified hybrid mobility system. The proposed design incorporates a hexapod configuration adapted from the hybrid rover ATHLETE, modified to create a mobility system suitable for autonomous exploration. The rover will also house a vine robot for exploration of caves, crevices and deep holes which are practically inaccessible or dangerous for the rover. The front-mounted camera of the vine robot will have the capability to explore these locations in infrared wavelength for ice detection. The rover has various exploration instruments on-board which will play a vital role in gathering data for scientific research and informed decision-making, thereby enabling its automation. It employs machine vision algorithms and real-time image processing for its autonomous navigation. The rover payload contains equipment designed to offer medical support, supplementary resources, physical assistance for medical emergencies or extended exploration missions.

This paper investigates the online data collection problem for MCS over an edge-assisted UAV network architecture, where UAVs work to collect the data required by tasks at different on-ground point-of-interests (PoIs) in an autonomous and cooperative manner. Different from conventional edge-assisted UAV networks, edge nodes in our paper help distribute, aggregate, share, and update the task state information (TSI, e.g., if a task has been completed, or if it still requires more data), to support efficient and cost-effective data collection, e.g., avoiding repetitive and ineffective task execution. In particular, a UAV can exchange TSI with an edge node when it is within the signal coverage of the edge node, while making decisions on PoI selection and path planning in an online and decentralized manner. To address the issue of edge-assisted UAV data collection, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm using personalized training with decentralized executing (PTDE) architecture. Different from the traditional centralized training with decentralized executing (CTDE) architecture, our considered architecture adopts the agent-specific state for critic networks instead of the joint observation, thus achieving effective utilization of environmental information.

The system is operated remotely with negligible risk to the operator. The integration of information collected by three robots has been achieved by software architecture. With this architecture, it is possible to plan the mission path, optimize the sensor settings and visualize the data from a remote terminal (e.g., a tablet or smartphone). The sensors used for the detection of plastic and metal landmines are installed in a configuration of three robots: microwave radar (Robot #1 with a UWB radar and Robot #3 with HSR radar), LiDAR (Robot #1 and Robot #3), high-resolution camera (Robot #1), and metal detector (Robot #2). The acquisition and processing of data from multiple radar sensors displayed improved detection and classification for small plastic-cased low-metal-content landmines (e.g., M-14 and Type 72) using high resolution microwave radar. These are generally difficult to detect with metal detectors alone. In real scenarios like the ongoing war in Ukraine, surface landmines like the PFM-1 (“butterfly”), are often scattered on the surface, and we demonstrated how artificial intelligence can be applied to detect this type of threat. Finally, because of booby traps rigged to protect minefields, demining also requires the detection of tripwires. For this purpose, the first robot in the team can detect trip wires of different types (metal, fiber or plastic) in real time. The robotic platforms are equipped with GNSS providing mapping of targets with accuracy better than $\text{1 0 ~ c m}$.","2687-7899","979-8-3315-2335-0","10.1109/IWAGPR65621.2025.11109008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11109008","Artificial Neural Network;GPR;GPS;Holographic Subsurface Radar;LIDAR;Metal Detector;Unexploded Ordnance;UWB;Robot swarm","Landmine detection;Laser radar;Robot vision systems;Radar detection;Metals;Detectors;Three-dimensional printing;Real-time systems;Ultra wideband radar;Surface treatment","","1","","16","IEEE","14 Aug 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In practice, VS control suffers potential stability and convergence problems due to image and physical constraints, e.g., field of view constraints, image local minima, obstacle collisions, and occlusion. Therefore, this article proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning-based hybrid visual servoing (DRL-HVS) controller for motion planning of VS tasks. DRL-HVS controller takes current observed image features and camera pose as inputs, and the core parameters of hybrid VS are dynamically optimized using a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to obtain an optimal motion scheme, considering image/physical constraints and robot motion performance. In addition, an adaptive exploration strategy is proposed to further improve the training efficiency by adaptively tuning the exploration noise parameters. In this way, the offline pretrained DRL-HVS controller in the virtual environment, where the DDPG actor–critic network is continuously optimized, can be quickly deployed to a real robot system for real-time control. Experiments based on an eye-in-hand VS system are conducted with a calibrated HIKVISION RGB camera mounted on the end-effector of a GSK-RB03A1 six degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) robot. Basic VS task experiments show that the proposed controller achieves better performance than the existing methods: the servoing time is 24% smaller than that of the five-dimensional VS method, a 100% success rate with the perturbed ranges of the initial position within 25 mm for translation and 20° for rotation, and a 48% efficiency improvement. Moreover, a planetary gear component assembly process case study, where the robot aims to automatically put the gears on the gear shafts, is conducted to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method in practice.","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2023.3275854","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB1312600); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52075480); Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:2021C01008); High-Level Talent Special Support Plan of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:2020R52004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10138316","Deep reinforcement learning (DRL);motion planning;robotic assembly;visual servoing (VS)","Robots;Task analysis;Cameras;Training;Visualization;Gears;Deep reinforcement learning;Robotic assembly;Visual servoing","","19","","42","IEEE","29 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This sensor is accompanied by a planning technique to generate exploration trajectories by using mere tactile perception. This technique relies on a hybrid policy for tactile exploration, which includes a proactive informative path planner for object searching, and a reactive Hopf oscillator for contour tracing. Results indicate that the hybrid exploration policy can increase the efficiency of object discovery. Last, scene understanding was facilitated by segmenting objects and classification. A classifier was developed to recognize the object categories based on the geometric features collected by the whisker sensor.

This paper presents an architecture for ontology-based semantic grasp planning that enables efficient and intuitive manual grasp pose specification without requiring extensive expertise in geometric programming or machine learning. By leveraging semantic representations of object geometries, gripper capabilities, and task-specific constraints, the system supports context-aware grasp candidate generation and prioritization. While the interpretation of the semantic models identifies suitable grasp types and involved geometric faces of objects and grippers, an optimization step generates suitable 6D poses that meet given constraints.

LLM-based robots are a way to realize embodied intelligence, but they still lack a general control paradigm to achieve embodied robot. We propose LAC (LLM-based Agents as the Controller), a new formulation to enable embodied robots to autonomously react to high-level tasks like humans. Specifically, the controller in LAC is LLM-based agents that can plan, decompose tasks and make decisions based on linguistic input. Two agents operate in parallel within the controller to replicate both instinctive reaction and deep consideration. The output of the controller consists of linguistic parameters that activate task-specific tools, enabling autonomous execution of low-level actions. LAC translates multi-modal feedback information into linguistic messages, which are then transmitted back to the controller to establish a closed-loop control flow. Once equipped with appropriate tools, the proposed LAC can be applied across various applications. A straightforward simulated office task, TASK0, illustrates the successful completion of the embodied task by LAC. Furthermore, testing five comparative LLMs on TASK0 also demonstrates that LAC serves as a potential test platform for validating the capability of LLMs to function as the cognitive center of embodied robots.","2994-3574","979-8-3315-0964-4","10.1109/ROBIO64047.2024.10907494","NBUT(grant numbers:2170011540012); CAAC(grant numbers:FZ2022KF17); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10907494","","Translation;Simulation;Large language models;Biomimetics;Humanoid robots;Linguistics;Real-time systems;Feedback control;Robots;Testing","","","","35","IEEE","7 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, implementing rapid and sustainable monitoring of these hazards is crucial. However, due to the variability of geological disasters across regions and their evolution over time, ensuring timely data collection and the ability to respond flexibly to disaster conditions presents a significant challenge. This paper designs a heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) system architecture for secondary disaster monitoring scenarios, including the follower UAV (FUAV) and the collector UAV (CUAV). Based on this architecture, a reinforcement learning-based low-delay data collection scheme (RLDC) is introduced. The scheme prioritizes the data collection from sensor nodes (SNs) with higher importance and dynamically plans the paths of UAVs to adapt to environmental changes. First, to address the challenge of data delay caused by the inability to precisely locate SNs, a path search algorithm based on fuzzy SN location is proposed. Second, to reduce data transmission delay between the FUAV and the CUAV, a load status update algorithm for FUAV is presented. Lastly, considering the dynamic changes in the importance of SNs, a bidirectional long short-term memory network multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient path planning algorithm (BMADDPG) is proposed. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the scheme can adapt to dynamic secondary geological disaster monitoring scenarios and achieve low-delay data collection from SNs.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2025.3554815","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902238); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2021M692493); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai Municipality(grant numbers:23ZR1426400); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10938908","Geohazard monitoring;Deep reinforcement learning;Low-delay;Unmanned aerial vehicle;Path planning","Disasters;Monitoring;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Data collection;Geology;Heuristic algorithms;Path planning;Delays;Vehicle dynamics;Hazards","","1","","37","IEEE","26 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on a careful analysis of the reactivity requirements and the computational costs of the central auctioneer (costs for solving Linear Integer Programs) and the local agents (costs for path-planning and task execution), this article explores the idea of each agent bidding for a subset of available tasks that are locally relevant to the agent. Each agent first employs a computationally light euclidean distance-based and percentile-based screening method to choose a subset of available tasks, followed by a more computationally complex, but realistic path-planning based cost-estimation and bidding for the chosen subset. The proposed strategy not only reduces the overall computational cost at the agents, but also at the central auctioneer, by reducing the size of the combinatorial optimization problems and the overall communication requirements of the architecture, thereby improving the scalability and reactivity of the overall system. It is shown that, through a one-time simulation-guided design of the bidding parameters, the improved reactivity and scaling is achieved while retaining the optimality or near-optimality of the resulting task-allocation. The performance of the proposed bidding strategies is evaluated in two large-scale simulation scenarios and the reduction in computational costs and the near-optimality of the task allocation is demonstrated.","2473-3504","979-8-3503-9544-0","10.1109/MED61351.2024.10566142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10566142","","Costs;Automation;Scalability;Computer architecture;Autonomous agents;Computational efficiency;Resource management","","1","","16","IEEE","27 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We utilise agent-based control of a robotic system wherein a rational agent, programmed using a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent programming language, acts as a high-level robot controller. This agent is aware of its mission specification and is able to recognise violations of this specification caused by unexpected events. On recognising such a violation, the agent can switch to a more suitable plan. However, if there are no suitable plans, the agent can also weaken its mission specification dynamically.

Leveraging the massive computing power of the cloud and low-latency connectivity to the edge can compensate for this lack of computing resources. However, this introduces a new challenge related to the deployment of complex robotic software across multiple devices, especially in a large-scale system. This paper presents KubeROS, a unified and fully managed platform for automated deployment of robotic applications developed on top of Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2), in a hybrid computing infrastructure with robots, edge and cloud. KubeROS uses Kubernetes from Cloud Native Computing as its underlying software orchestration framework. It aims to help researchers and developers with no prior cloud computing knowledge deploy their ROS2-based robotic applications at any scale. KubeROS eliminates the need for system configuration and network setup. We demonstrate the applicability of KubeROS by deploying a fleet of simulated mobile manipulators in a clas-sical pick-and-place application. The experiments demonstrate the effects of different deployment strategies for vision-based motion planning under different fleet sizes and workloads. In addition, KubeROS improves task performance by using high-performance computing at the edge and in the cloud, and achieves high resource efficiency when using the shared deployment strategy.","","979-8-3503-2365-8","10.1109/ICRA48891.2023.10160632","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(grant numbers:13FH579KX9); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10160632","","Cloud computing;Operating systems;Memory management;Manipulators;Software;Planning;Large-scale systems","","10","","46","IEEE","4 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A typical exam for DVT using ultrasound (US) imaging is by pressing the target vein until its lumen is fully compressed. However, the compression exam is highly operator-dependent. To alleviate intra- and inter-variations, we present a robotic US system with a novel hybrid force motion control scheme ensuring position and force tracking accuracy, and soft landing of the probe onto the target surface. In addition, a path-based virtual fixture is proposed to realize easy human-robot interaction for repeat compression operation at the lesion location. To ensure the biometric measurements obtained in different examinations are comparable, the 6D scanning path is determined in a coarse-to-fine manner using both an external RGBD camera and US images. The RGBD camera is first used to extract a rough scanning path on the object. Then, the segmented vascular lumen from US images are used to optimize the scanning path to ensure the visibility of the target object. To generate a continuous scan path for developing virtual fixtures, an arc-length based path fitting model considering both position and orientation is proposed. Finally, the whole system is evaluated on a human-like arm phantom with an uneven surface. The code (https://github.com/dianyeHuang/RobDVTUS) and intuitive demonstration video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xFyqU1rV8c) can be publicly accessed. Note to Practitioners—Robotic ultrasound (US) systems have attracted attention for various applications in the past decades. However, the existing studies are not mature and intelligent enough for some challenging applications, such as DVT exam, which requires rich contact interaction between patients and clinicians. To tackle with this challenge, this study presents a novel human-centric robotic DVT exam program using the technique of virtual fixture. The coarse-to-fine path planning module ensures the repeatability of US acquisitions carried out at different times. During DVT exam, the proposed continuous 6D path virtual fixture can guide clinicians to freely move the probe along the scan path while limiting the probe motion in other directions. In order to perform the compress-release exam, a decoupled position/force controller is developed to precisely generate the contact force conveyed by clinicians and to restrict the probe motion along the probe centerline. We believe such a robot-assisted system is a promising solution to take both advantages of robots about the accuracy and repeatability and human operators about the advanced physiological knowledge.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2024.3351076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10399375","Deep venous thrombosis (DVT);robotic ultrasound;hybrid force motion control;virtual fixture;path planning","Robots;Force;Probes;Fixtures;Cameras;Veins;Thrombosis","","9","","39","IEEE","12 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

More recent endeavors attempt to have a unified approach with legged and humanoid robots. These solutions, however, occupy large amounts of space thus reducing the number of packages that can fit into a delivery vehicle. As a result, these bulky robotic systems often reduce the potential for scalability and task parallelization. In this paper, we introduce LIMMS (Latching Intelligent Modular Mobility System) to address both the manipulation and delivery portion of a typical last-mile delivery while maintaining a minimal spatial footprint. LIMMS is a symmetrically designed, 6 degree of freedom (DoF) appendage-like robot with wheels and latching mechanisms at both ends. By latching onto a surface and anchoring at one end, LIMMS can function as a traditional 6-DoF manipulator arm. On the other hand, multiple LIMMS can latch onto a single box and behave like a legged robotic system where the package is the body. During transit, LIMMS folds up compactly and takes up much less space compared to traditional robotic systems. A large group of LIMMS units can fit inside of a single delivery vehicle, opening the potential for new delivery optimization and hybrid planning methods never done before. In this paper, the feasibility of LIMMS is studied and presented using a hardware prototype as well as simulation results for a range of sub-tasks in a typical last-mile delivery.","","978-1-6654-8253-0","10.1109/UR55393.2022.9826272","LG Electronics; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826272","","Legged locomotion;Latches;Torque;Prototypes;Humanoid robots;Wheels;Manipulators","","4","","26","IEEE","14 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This influence is well understood for simple trajectories; however, assembly sequences for full structures require multiple repetitive motions, with and without load, which significantly affect the attitude and orbital control of the satellite. This paper analyzes such perturbations for a complex assembly task, the construction of the primary mirror for a space telescope, using a hybrid planner with two levels: a low level that considers individual motions of the robotic arm, and a high level that generates the overall assembly sequence while minimizing the perturbations created on the attitude control system.

To support these capabilities, increasingly autonomous flight systems are required that can perform dedicated mission functions, e.g. payload targeting and communications, and system-level functions, e.g. planning and goal monitoring. Architecting an autonomous system requires a well-reasoned, self-consistent framework to avoid ad hoc design choices that will introduce complexity and risk. The Framework for Robust Execution and Scheduling of Commands On-Board, FRESCO, is the result of lessons learned in developing a software architecture to enable autonomous solar system exploration. FRESCO generalizes this work to offer a modular, software-agnostic approach to developing verifiable architecture for autonomous space systems. FRESCO specifies guiding principles, functions, interfaces, and interactions from which mission-specific autonomous control architectures can be derived. FRESCO is a principled framework relying on explicit, state-based goal definitions, centralized management of state knowledge, clearly separated control boundaries, and hierarchical reasoning. Using components from FRESCO reference architecture, an autonomous decision-making architecture can be designed for spacecraft which can then be mapped to flight software architecture. FRESCO is flexibly defined to enable autonomous control of flight systems built using extensive software and hardware heritage. Finally, FRESCO-derived architectures support a spectrum of operator/spacecraft interactions, ranging from traditional commanding to goal-driven commanding with the ability to change mission goals autonomously. FRESCO has been used in defining the autonomy architectures for the ASTERIA mission and have been demonstrated in laboratory and software simulation for small body rendezvous and in-space servicing missions.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-7436-5","10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438470","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9438470","","Space vehicles;Software architecture;Autonomous systems;Computer architecture;Robot sensing systems;Software;Solar system","","8","","42","IEEE","7 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, we develop the collision detection model between the manipulator and obstacle based on the cylinder and sphere bounding box, and the shortest distance between the link and obstacle at each moment is obtained. Afterward, hybrid constrained sampling is used instead of original random sampling. The distribution of nodes obtained by sampling is close to the passages between obstacles. During the sampling process, the forward search process is accelerated. In the expansion, we propose a novel approach of RRT_Connect in collaboration with the artificial potential field method. Meanwhile, the adaptive gravitational field, dynamic step size, and new node constraint strategy are adopted. In the process of expansion, the algorithm uses the information of the environment and nodes to expand to the target area in a short time, which reduces the excessive exploration and collision area expansion. Considering the low success rate of algorithm planning in complex, multiobstacle and dynamic environments, local minimum processing and a dynamic path planning method are proposed, which generate double trees in the Cartesian and configuration spaces, respectively, for local path replanning. The improved algorithm is more robust to the singular problems of the manipulator, and the path is smoother after pruning optimization. Simulation results show that, compared with other algorithms, the proposed method can effectively plan a safe and optimal obstacle avoidance path with the best comprehensive performance. Experiments on the actual robotic manipulator platform further prove the efficiency of our method.","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2022.3165845","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1308303); Excellent Youth Foundation of Jiangsu Scientific Committee(grant numbers:BK20211531); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9762465","Dynamic obstacle avoidance;path planning;rapidly exploring random tree (RRT);robotic manipulator;singularity","Planning;Collision avoidance;Heuristic algorithms;Robots;Manipulator dynamics;Mechatronics","","63","","33","IEEE","25 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, when these transitions are well-understood, they can be leveraged to reduce uncertainty or aid manipulation-for example, wiggling a screw to determine if it is fully inserted or not. Current model-free reinforcement learning approaches require large amounts of data to learn to leverage such dynamics, scale poorly as problem complexity grows, and do not transfer well to significantly different problems. By contrast, hierarchical POMDP planning-based methods scale well via plan decomposition, work well on novel problems, and directly consider uncertainty, but often rely on precise hand-specified models and task decompositions. To combine the advantages of these opposing paradigms, we propose a new method, MICAH, which given unsegmented data of an object's motion under applied actions, (1) detects changepoints in the object motion model using action-conditional inference, (2) estimates the individual local motion models with their parameters, and (3) converts them into a hybrid automaton that is compatible with hierarchical POMDP planning. We show that model learning under MICAH is more accurate and robust to noise than prior approaches. Further, we combine MICAH with a hierarchical POMDP planner to demonstrate that the learned models are rich enough to be used for performing manipulation tasks under uncertainty that require the objects to be used in novel ways not encountered during training.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-6212-6","10.1109/IROS45743.2020.9340749","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9340749","","Training;Uncertainty;Learning automata;Data models;Planning;Trajectory;Task analysis","","11","","24","IEEE","10 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Classical algorithms work well in the case of static obstacles but suffer from collisions in the case of dense and dynamic obstacles. Recent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms provide safe solutions for multiagent robotic motion planning systems. However, these algorithms face challenges in convergence: slow convergence speed and suboptimal converged result. Inspired by RL and representation learning, we introduced the ALN-DSAC: a hybrid motion planning algorithm where attention-based long short-term memory (LSTM) and novel data replay combine with discrete soft actor–critic (SAC). First, we implemented a discrete SAC algorithm, which is the SAC in the setting of discrete action space. Second, we optimized existing distance-based LSTM encoding by attention-based encoding to improve the data quality. Third, we introduced a novel data replay method by combining the online learning and offline learning to improve the efficacy of data replay. The convergence of our ALN-DSAC outperforms that of the trainable state of the arts.

These exoskeletons, which closely couple with patients’ limbs, need to move in harmony with the endoskeleton motions. To achieve coordination, exoskeletons should be transparent; in other words, they should not interfere with natural human motion or their underlying coordination strategies. Transparency can be achieved through a bio-inspired exoskeleton design and also by implementing appropriate force control methods to maneuver exoskeleton motions. A new hybrid active-passive Gait Exoskeleton-Assisted Rehabilitation (GEAR) robot is presented here for the rehabilitation of lower limb disabilities. The GEAR robot is designed to enhance transparency incorporating a flexible hip joint and a biomimetic knee joint. The proposed GEAR robot also integrates a Remote Centered Motion (RCM) based passive mechanism to support torso and pelvic motions in two planes and features actuated exoskeleton legs in the sagittal plane for treadmill-assisted walking. The exoskeleton legs are actuated at their hip and knee joints using backdrivable actuators. To provide a natural walking experience, the hip joints of the exoskeleton legs offer two passive degrees of freedom in the frontal and transverse planes in addition to the actuated sagittal plane motion. The biomimetic design of the exoskeleton knee joint ensures alignment with the human anatomical knee joint by closely tracking the latter’s instantaneous center of rotation (ICR). To evaluate GEAR robot’s transparency, a comparative study was conducted, involving three healthy subjects. The participants walked freely on a treadmill and then with the GEAR robot operated first in a completely backdrivable (i.e., passive) mode and subsequently in an active mode. The sEMG data collected during these experiments were analyzed to assess robot’s transparency.","2576-3202","","10.1109/TMRB.2024.3504002","World Bank and the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan under the framework of the “Gait Rehabilitation Using Exoskeleton Assisted Technology” financed through the Project “Stimulating Productive Innovation”(grant numbers:6514); Nazarbayev University through the Faculty-Development Competitive Research Grants Program for 2024–2026(grant numbers:201223FD8813); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10759858","Gait rehabilitation;gait exoskeleton assisted rehabilitation (GEAR);robot transparency;natural walking;and self-alignment","Robots;Exoskeletons;Legged locomotion;Robot kinematics;Knee;Gears;Hip;Biomimetics;Assistive robots;Torso","","4","","65","IEEE","21 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Collaborative robots are considered safe and individual robot actions can often be easily programmed, for example, by physical hand-guiding. Coordinated collaboration, where tasks and the environment are shared, cannot be so easily achieved, due to continuously changing conditions and actions that need to be triggered at unknown instances. Besides, knowledge required for collaboration is difficult to program into robotic systems. This paper presents a system architecture that aims at facilitating human-robot collaboration by alleviating the need for pre-programmed information and exploring ways to teach new skills. This is done by reducing the amount of information required to program tasks by utilizing a knowledge base that represents knowledge on tasks, actions and the world. Automatic reasoning over conditions and properties of the knowledge is then utilized to generate available actions and action plans in order to complete the shared tasks. Moreover, learning new tasks is enabled by extending the original knowledge base, concatenating available actions and tasks into news bricks of knowledge. Two examples, a kitting task and a handover task, serve to validate the system architecture and exemplify its usage. Experiments demonstrate that by combining reasoning methods and knowledge-based planning, high-level shared tasks can be generated and executed, and robots can act reliable as teammate to human operators.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3583469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11052273","Human-robot collaboration;knowledge-based systems;robot programming","Robots;Ontologies;Knowledge based systems;Service robots;Robot sensing systems;Planning;Assembly;Cognition;Collaborative robots;Human-robot interaction","","","","62","CCBY","26 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This breakthrough has garnered significant attention and investment worldwide, driving innovation and growth in the digital era. However, the adoption of cloud-based 5G core (5GC) networks, while offering scalability and deployment flexibility, has posed challenges to meeting stringent latency requirements, particularly for uRLLC services specifically for robotic telesurgery. To address this problem, mobile network operators (MNOs) have turned to edge computing (EC), using the control and user plane separation (CUPS) architecture introduced in the third-generation partnership project (3GPP) release 14 specification. This architecture enables the deployment of the user plane function (UPF) closer to users, reducing latency, and improving quality of service (QoS). However, the deployment of the UPF as a standalone node on the edge of the network exposes the packet forwarding control protocol (PFCP) to cybersecurity attacks, which pose risks to telesurgery services and could even lead to loss of life. In the existing literature, only a few techniques focus on minimising these attacks when the UPF is deployed on the edge of the network far from the 5GC. Therefore, this paper reviews PFCP attacks and explores machine learning (ML) techniques to mitigate these security threats. This paper further provides recommendations and future research directions for mitigating these attacks.","","979-8-3315-1740-3","10.1109/NextComp63004.2024.10779903","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10779903","5G;CUPS;uRLLC;UPF;PFCP Attacks;Telesurgery","Protocols;Accuracy;Reviews;Computational modeling;Quality of service;Machine learning;Computer architecture;Ultra reliable low latency communication;Vectors;Robots","","","","37","IEEE","13 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider a constrained nonlinear dynamical system and assume the availability of state-input trajectories solving control tasks in different environments. In addition to task-invariant system state and input constraints, a parameterized environment model generates task-specific state constraints, which are satisfied by the stored trajectories. Our goal is to use these trajectories to find a safe and high-performing policy for a new task in a new, unknown environment. We propose using the stored data to learn generalizable control strategies. At each time step, based on a local forecast of the new task environment, the learned strategy consists of a target region in the state space and input constraints to guide the system evolution to the target region. These target regions are used as terminal sets by a low-level model predictive controller. We show how to i) design the target sets from past data and then ii) incorporate them into a model predictive control scheme with shifting horizon that ensures safety of the closed-loop system when performing the new task. We prove the feasibility of the resulting control policy, and apply the proposed method to robotic path planning, racing, and computer game applications. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the challenge of designing safe controllers for autonomous systems navigating through new environments. We consider scenarios where trajectory data from control tasks in different environments is available to the control designer. Possible applications include autonomous vehicles racing on new tracks or robotic manipulators performing tasks in the presence of new obstacles. Existing approaches to model-based control design for new environments generally use trajectory libraries, systematically adapting stored trajectories to the constraints of the new environment. This typically requires a priori knowledge of the entire task environment as well as resources to store and maintain the growing library. This paper suggests a new hierarchical control approach, in which stored trajectories are used to learn high-level strategies that can be applied while solving the new task. The strategies are learned offline, and only the parameterized strategy function needs to be stored for online control. Strategies only require knowledge of the nearby task environment, and provide navigation guidelines for the system. In this paper we show how to find such strategies from previous task data and how to integrate them into a low-level controller to safely and efficiently solve the new task. We also show how to adapt the modular framework as needed for a user’s desired application. Simulation experiments in robotic manipulator, autonomous vehicle, and computer game examples suggest that our approach can be used in a wide range of applications. In future research, we will address how to adapt the method for time-varying or stochastic environments.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2021.3137769","National Physical Science Consortium; National Institute of Standards and Technology; Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:ONR-N00014-18-1-2833); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:NSF-1931853); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9675285","Learning;hierarchical control;model predictive control","Task analysis;Trajectory;Aerospace electronics;Predictive control;Adaptation models;Target tracking;Navigation","","13","","48","IEEE","10 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This mechanism can be used to navigate objects (e.g., capsule endoscopy, swarms of drug particles) through complex environments when active control is a necessity but where direct manipulation can be hazardous. The proposed control scheme consists of a switching control architecture implemented by two sub-controllers. The first sub-controller is designed to employ the robot’s inverse kinematic solutions to do an environment search for the to-be-carried ferromagnetic particle while being robust to disturbances. The second sub-controller uses a customized rainbow algorithm to control a robotic arm, i.e., the UR5 robot, to carry a ferromagnetic particle to a desired position through a constrained environment. For the customized Rainbow algorithm, Quantile Huber loss from the Implicit Quantile Networks (IQN) algorithm and ResNet are employed. The proposed controller is first trained and tested in a real-time physics simulation engine (PyBullet). Afterward, the trained controller is transferred to a UR5 robot to remotely transport a ferromagnetic particle in a real-world scenario to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. The experimental results on the UR5 robot show an average success rate of 98.86% over 30 episodes for randomly generated trajectories, demonstrating the viability of the proposed approach for real-life applications. In addition, two classical path finding approaches, Attractor Dynamics and the execution extended Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (ERRT), are also investigated and compared to the RL-based method. The proposed RL-based algorithm is shown to achieve performance comparable to that of the tested classical path planners whilst being more robust to deploy in dynamical environments. Note to Practitioners —Deep reinforcement learning methods have been widely applied in computer games and simulations. However, employing these algorithms for practical, real-world applications such as robotics becomes challenging due to the difficulty of obtaining training samples. This paper predominantly focuses on bridging the gap between simulations and the real-world implementation of a reinforcement learning algorithm for a robotic application in the context of miniaturized drug delivery robots and robotic capsule endoscopes. This paper presents the derivation and experimental validation of a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for controlling a magnetically-actuated small-scale robot within a simplified model of the large intestine in the presence of disturbances. We demonstrate the possibility of training a high-fidelity reinforcement learning algorithm fully within a simulated environment before deploying it as-is in a real-world scenario by carrying out different experiments and simulations.

Teleoperating planetary rovers is a tedious task as it requires close to real-time monitoring and planning, while distance and communication delay further cripple the efficiency. Future up-scaling of off-world robotic systems deployment makes it increasingly difficult to monitor and command each agent in real-time. Thus, at least an autonomous maneuvering capability is essential to reduce the operational workload at the ground station. In order to achieve this objective, the rover is required to understand its operational environment. The rover then needs to process the information at real-time and efficiently respond in order to complete the allocated tasks or to recover from hazards.

The framework’s architecture was engineered to be readily deployed on low-power embedded systems (Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi 4) and evaluated via TensorRT quantization and kernel fusion. Experimental evaluations reveal a 92.1% F1-score in emotion classification, 94.2% task-switching accuracy, and 34.8 ms response latency outperforming state-of-the-art models including CLEF and Pepper-based multimodal planners. Performance in real-time was achieved with up to 30 FPS on edge devices. A user satisfaction rating of 4.4/5 indicates strong perceived coherence and empathy in social interaction scenarios. ECRP offers a robust, scalable, and socially coherent solution for real-time human–robot interaction, outperforming existing methods both in accuracy and latency. Its fusion of emotional understanding and adaptive task planning significantly improves human engagement, making it suitable for use in elderly care, education, and customer service domains.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3603738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11143179","Emotion-aware robotics;human–robot interaction;multimodal fusion;real-time inference;task-switching accuracy;Jetson Nano deployment;context-aware decision-making","Robots;Real-time systems;Human-robot interaction;Emotion recognition;Planning;Reinforcement learning;Hardware;Accuracy;Robot sensing systems;Privacy","","","","42","CCBY","28 Aug 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article introduces an innovative parallel model predictive path integral (MPPI) algorithm enabling the robot to navigate swiftly and safely in such environments. Unlike the conventional MPPI methods that rely on a single sequence of Gaussian means for trajectory sampling, the proposed parallel MPPI (PMPPI) concurrently runs multiple planners with different strategies and adaptively integrates planned paths based on the current state, leveraging the advantages of different strategies and greatly improving the MPPI’s exploration capability. Moreover, a gradient-velocity modulated signed distance field (SDF) cost function that dynamically adjusts costs based on the robot’s velocity and the SDF gradient is defined, thereby promoting safer and purposeful motion planning. In the implementation, techniques like utilizing inverse kinematics solver for path guidance and sparse reward to expedite reaching time are integrated into the MPPI cost function design. Comparative evaluations against the traditional MPPI architecture and standard SDF cost designs demonstrate the superiority of the new method.

To achieve scalability and dependability, it was necessary to propose the geographical dispersal of a logically centralized control plane due to the huge scale of networks. Software-defined networking (SDN) load-balancing optimization has been studied for a long time. Many approaches to the load-balancing conundrum have been put forth by researchers, but very few have taken the impact of transmission delay between controllers and switches under heavy network load into account. In this article we elaborate the various techniques of load balancing in SDN those working on different areas like multi-controller, switch migration, multi-agent, strategy, time sharing, prediction, reinforcement learning etc. We discuss the methods used along with the advantages and disadvantages of various costs, service quality, and network performance metrics.","","979-8-3503-2230-9","10.1109/AISC56616.2023.10085328","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10085328","SDN;Controller;Load Optimization;QoS;Switch;Migration.","Costs;Scalability;Reinforcement learning;Quality of service;Load management;Throughput;Software defined networking;Stress;Optimization;Traffic congestion","","8","","34","IEEE","3 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, the growth of renewable energy sources (RES) has been greatly accelerated thanks to the privatization and deregulation of the energy industry, as well as financial incentives and energy policy measures. As decentralized energy generation is developed through residential and commercial PV applications, a new position described as an energy prosumer is produced. The traditional division between energy users and producers is eliminated as a result. Blockchain technology automate direct energy transactions inside a distributed system architecture based on consensus-based verification and cryptographic hashing, providing utilities, prosumers, and consumers with a one-of-a-kind, cost-effective, and secure energy-trading system. The objective of this project is to implement a general ABM simulation framework for energy exchange and demonstrate the operation of any blockchain process as well as the expected power profiles of homes. A robust multi-agent structure was constructed and simulated for a Transactive Energy (TE) type Distributed Energy Resources (DER) within the ECCH microgrid that is dependent on blockchain engineering. Auction systems are used in recent blockchain-based LEM plans to balance supply and demand in the future. These blockchain-based LEMs rely on accurate short-term forecasts of the energy generation and consumption of particular homes as a consequence. Such accurate estimations are usually only assumed. In the present study, this assumption was tested by first evaluating the forecast accuracy that can be obtained for particular families using state-of-the-art energy forecasting methods, and then by examining the effects of prediction mistakes on market outcomes in three alternative supply scenarios. The evaluation showed that an LSTM model may provide rather little predicting errors. The prediction process will be modified to fit the design of a blockchain-based LEM. Because of this, the current study differs greatly from past investigations that make a thorough effort to predict the time sequence of smart meters generally.","","978-1-6654-6195-5","10.1109/ICMT56556.2022.9997618","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9997618","Blockchain;short-term energy forecasting;long short-term memory (LSTM);market mechanism;market simulation","Transactive energy;Renewable energy sources;Supply and demand;Systems architecture;Solar energy;Production;Predictive models","","7","","20","IEEE","30 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a multi-agent framework called ArgMed-Agents, which aims to enable LLM-based agents to make explainable clinical decision reasoning through interaction. ArgMed-Agents performs self-argumentation iterations via Argumentation Scheme for Clinical Discussion (a reasoning mechanism for modeling cognitive processes in clinical reasoning), and then constructs the argumentation process as a directed graph representing conflicting relationships. Ultimately, use symbolic solver to identify a series of rational and coherent arguments to support decision. We construct a formal model of ArgMed-Agents and present conjectures for theoretical guarantees. ArgMed-Agents enables LLMs to mimic the process of clinical argumentative reasoning by generating explanations of reasoning in a self-directed manner. The setup experiments show that ArgMed-Agents not only improves accuracy in complex clinical decision reasoning problems compared to other prompt methods, but more importantly, it provides users with decision explanations that increase their confidence.","2156-1133","979-8-3503-8622-6","10.1109/BIBM62325.2024.10822109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10822109","Clinical Decision Support;Large Language Model;Multi-Agent System;Explainable AI","Decision support systems;Accuracy;Cognitive processes;Large language models;Directed graphs;Medical services;Probabilistic logic;Cognition;Natural language processing;Planning","","3","","44","IEEE","10 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Gravity compensation is one of the most effective ways to optimize such mechanisms for better energy efficiency and for reducing the strain of the actuators involved. Spring-based gravity compensation can effectively reduce both the motor torque and energy consumption but is subjected to degradation over time and requires maintenance. Alternatively, counterweight compensation offers consistent performance but at the cost of higher structural loads on mechanical links. Most studies primarily focus on motor torques, often overlooking the joint reaction forces encountered along the manipulator's designed paths within the workspace. This paper presents a dynamic model for a planar quasi-serial mechanism considering joint reaction forces. Derivations are first made for a compensation-free system, yielding 12 force and moment equations for all the links, with 12 unknowns. After that, spring and counterweight compensations are added, and new dynamic equations are derived. Motor torques and joint forces are examined under three conditions: no compensation, spring compensation, and counterweight compensation. Theoretical models are verified by MSC Adams simulations, highlighting the importance of understanding joint forces to assess the internal stresses and loads on each link during operation. This analysis is essential for optimizing component sizing and material selection, ensuring durability and reliability under extreme industrial use. Accurate joint force analysis reduces maintenance by preventing mechanical failures, enhancing performance and lifetime by providing practical insight into the most efficient gravity compensation methodology used in robotic systems.","2572-6889","979-8-3315-2973-4","10.1109/ICRoM64545.2024.10903654","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10903654","Quasi-serial manipulator;Gravity compensation;Spring compensation;Counterweight;Joint reaction force","Torque;Service robots;Dynamics;Motors;Mathematical models;Maintenance;Springs;Manipulator dynamics;Gravity;Load modeling","","","","17","IEEE","5 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to circumvent this issue, we offer a hybrid optimization approach for AUV path planning in an obstacle-filled environment subject to communication limitations. To coordinate several AUVs in a fixed topology environment, a PD controller is employed. A remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) is a type of submersible underwater vehicle that can operate without human intervention.

Due to the intricacy of the AUV motion control problem, a simulation environment was built in MATLAB/SIMULINK utilising the specifications of the widely used INFANTE AUV.

To gain kidney access, the surgeon steers a needle towards the kidney while simultaneously controlling the position and orientation of a US probe to keep the needle in the image plane. To successfully reach the kidney while avoiding delicate structures, a significant level of skill and precision is required. To alleviate the surgeon's cognitive workload, robot-assisted needle tracking can be implemented to autonomously track the needle in the US images and adjust the US probe's position and orientation such that the same portion of the needle is visible in the images. This paper presents a US-guided visual servoing (VS) algorithm to track the translation and rotation of a needle in a plane. Image features representing the desired pose of the needle in the image are defined, through which an interaction matrix is devised to relate the rate of the change of the image features in US images to the required position and orientation of the US probe connected to a robotic manipulator. Experimental results in 4 experimental scenarios in a water tank demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in tracking the needle in real-time with an accuracy of 2.6 mm with a control rate of 20 Hz.

To address the aforementioned issue, this paper proposes a method named Mix Q-learning for Lane Changing (MQLC) that integrates a hybrid value Q network, taking into account both collective and individual benefits for the greater good. At the collective level, our method coordinates the individual Q and global Q networks by utilizing global information. This enables agents to effectively balance their individual interests with the collective benefit. At the individual level, we integrate a deep learning-based intent recognition module into our observation and enhance the decision network. These changes provide agents with richer decision information and more precise feature extraction for improved lane-changing decisions. This strategy enables the multi-agent system to learn and formulate optimal decision-making strategies effectively. Our MQLC model, through extensive experimental results, impressively outperforms other state-of-the-art multi-agent decision-making methods, effectively improving the overall efficiency.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2025.3533006","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62236011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10886976","Automated vehicle;lane change;multi-agent deep reinforcement learning","Decision making;Adaptation models;Trajectory;Collaboration;Data models;Space vehicles;Autonomous vehicles;Training;Predictive models;Vehicle dynamics","","7","","48","IEEE","13 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we first propose an HJ reachability-based method for solving the reach-avoid game in which 2 attackers are playing against 1 defender; we derive the numerically convergent optimal winning sets for the two sides in environments with obstacles. Utilizing this result and previous results for the 1 vs. 1 game, we further propose solving the general multi-agent reach-avoid game by determining the defender assignments that can maximize the number of attackers captured via a Mixed Integer Program (MIP).

A camera, interfaced with a Raspberry Pi, continuously captures video frames, identifying potentially dangerous objects. Upon detection, both the input frame and the detected object are stored for further analysis. The robot’s balance is maintained through the use of an MPU6050 sensor, which provides feedback on the robot’s angular inclination.

Over a decade later, formulating robot capabilities remains a significant technical hurdle in bringing robots from the lab into everyday life. This paper introduces Capabilities2, a successor to the original Capabilities package, now reimagined for ROS2. Capabilities2 enhances the original design by enabling advancements in skill-based control techniques and offering a more efficient, extensible framework for defining and utilising robot capabilities. We delve into its application in new real-world scenarios, with a particular focus on human-robot interactions and the deployment of collaborative mobile robots in human-centric environments. Capabilities2 addresses challenges in implementing intuitive, collaborative robots by introducing an abstracted database handler, an object-relational mapping for capability models, and a plugin architecture for capability execution. These features support dynamic capability representation, runtime adaptability, and integration with modern AI techniques for skill-based task planning. By providing a standardised yet flexible framework, Capabilities2 reduces the integration effort required to develop top-level controls for real-world scenarios, facilitating rapid development and deployment. Our contributions include the reimplementation of the Capabilities package in ROS2, enhancements to support contemporary robotic applications, and demonstrations of new use cases enabled by Capabilities2.

They can be benign or malignant. Patient care and treatment planning depend on a timely and precise diagnosis of these tumors. A widely used image technique that aids in the visualisation of brain structures and makes anomalies like tumors visible is magnetic resonance imaging or MRI. However, radiologists must manually analyse MRI scans, which takes time, is labour-intensive, and is prone to human error-especially when the tumors are small or diffuse. Recent developments in the deep learning method known as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have demonstrated the capability of robotic medical image processing. U-Net is widely regarded as one of the most effective CNN architectures for medical image segmentation; it has been used to good effect in several biomedical image segmentation applications. This paper presents an automated approach for detecting and segmenting brain tumors in MRI scans using a deep learning frame- work based on the U-Net model. To achieve high accuracy and efficient processing, we apply a U-Net architecture to segment tumors from MRI images using the Brain Tumor Segmentation dataset (BraTS). The MRI scans and their related ground-truth masks are employed in the model's training and accuracy and loss are used to assess its performance. Our findings show that U-Net is capable of precisely segmenting brain tumors, which could make it a useful tool for radiologists to use in tumor diagnosis and localisation. With additional improvements, this technique may greatly improve the accuracy and efficacy of tumor diagnosis in clinical settings.","","979-8-3315-3607-7","10.1109/ICCSAI64074.2025.11063750","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11063750","Medical Image Segmentation;U-Net;MRI Images;CNN","Deep learning;Training;Image segmentation;Visualization;Accuracy;Magnetic resonance imaging;Brain tumors;Brain modeling;Convolutional neural networks;Medical diagnostic imaging","","","","22","IEEE","14 Jul 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prior work mainly focused on performance without examining cerebral cortical dynamics via brain biomarkers to assess the level of practice during the learning of such assistive devices. Specifically, it was suggested that EEG biomarkers like low- and high-beta spectral power are related to learning as they assess memory formation and attentional mechanisms. Therefore, this work examines how sensorimotor performance, and low-/high-beta spectral power are influenced as individuals without disabilities practice reaching movements with a simulated robotic effector executed via a head-controlled interface. Results revealed faster and straighter reaching movements. Additionally, as individuals progressed from early to late practice, the movement planning stage revealed an elevation of frontal, central and parietal low-beta power and an attenuation of high-beta power in the temporal region. These spectral modulations may reflect an internal model memory encoding process of the novel sensorimotor mapping imposed by this interface throughout practice which ultimately enables improved reaching performance. This work could inform patients' cognitive-motor processes when learning to control assistive systems and provide biomarkers for monitoring practice during rehabilitation.","1945-7901","979-8-3503-8068-2","10.1109/ICORR66766.2025.11063193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11063193","","Performance evaluation;Biological system modeling;Process control;Modulation;Biomarkers;Robot sensing systems;Brain modeling;Encoding;Assistive devices;Monitoring","Humans;Arm;Robotics;Male;Adult;Electroencephalography;Female;Brain;Young Adult;Biomarkers;Movement;Head","","","49","IEEE","11 Jul 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Eye gaze is traditionally used for “gaze triggering” (GT) in which staring at an object, or sequence of objects, triggers pre-programmed robotic movements. We propose an alternative approach: a neural network-based “action prediction” (AP) mode that extracts gaze-related features to recognize, and often predict, an operator’s intended action primitives. We integrated the AP mode into a shared autonomy framework capable of 3D gaze reconstruction, real-time intent inference, object localization, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic trajectory planning. Using this framework, we conducted a user study to directly compare the performance of the GT and AP modes using traditional subjective performance metrics, such as Likert scales, as well as novel objective performance metrics, such as the delay of recognition. Statistical analyses suggested that the AP mode resulted in more seamless robotic movement than the state-of-the-art GT mode, and that participants generally preferred the AP mode.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3328888","Office of Naval Research Award(grant numbers:N00014-16-1-2468); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10302429","Assistive robotics;eye tracking;gaze vector;gaze-based control;intent inference;robotic manipulation;shared autonomy","Robots;Three-dimensional displays;Task analysis;Cameras;Recurrent neural networks;Real-time systems;Feature extraction","Humans;Robotics;Activities of Daily Living;Fixation, Ocular;Movement","4","","41","CCBY","31 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To improve the scalability, we present a new scheme of positional encoding for angles, allowing all agents to share the same vectorized context and the use of an architecture based on dot-product attention.

In this paper, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Hierarchical Optimal Scheduling Algorithm (MARLHOSA) is proposed to solve the hierarchical scheduling problem of logistics transport vehicles. We model the hierarchical scheduling problem of logistics transport vehicles as an infinite Markov decision process and set constraints to simulate the actual operating environment. To solve the Markov decision process corresponding to the economic scheduling problem of logistics transport vehicles, this paper uses the close-range strategy optimization algorithm, and uses multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm based on the clipping mechanism to improve the loss function of the short-range strategy optimization algorithm. In addition, a distributed training architecture was designed for the training process of the close-range strategy optimization algorithm, so as to improve the speed of data collection and training speed and quality. According to a demand order put forward by the company, a path-loading collaborative optimization model was established. After solving the model, the number of vehicles dispatched by each vehicle type according to the optimal path-loading scheme of each vehicle type was determined. The simulation results show that the proposed improved distributed proximity strategy optimization algorithm can achieve the same economic performance as the numerical optimization method. Compared with the traditional algorithm, MARLHOSA can reduce the total vehicle mileage by 34.5% and increase the average loading rate of the carriage by 28.6%.

Each agent is equipped with an actor to learn an action policy, and a shared critic evaluates a state value.

As an emerging technique, multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) coordination technique brings a promising prospect to dam inspection, in which the core of the technique is UAVs Coverage Path Panning (UAVs-CPP), i.e., designing flight routes for UAVs to ensure comprehensive coverage of all point of interests within a dam region. Unfortunately, the dam region inevitably encounters natural disasters such as, the thunderstorm, strong wind, and earthquake, which is called abnormal environment. The abnormal environment triggers two issues: 1) the natural disasters leads to communication obstacles between UAVs due to communication link interruption and signal loss, and 2) the coverage and energy consumption of UAVs cannot be neglected. The existing coverage path planning algorithms are insufficient in the abnormal environment. To tackle these issue, a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based architecture is devised for UAVs-CPP in the dam inspection under the abnormal environment, called Trace Pheromone Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TP-MADDPG). Specifically, we first integrate a trace pheromone mechanism and Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG). The trace pheromone mechanism can simulate the natural pheromone, which promotes the inner indirect communication between UAVs. Furthermore, we employ a MADDPG to perform UAVs-CPP, in which a reward function is designed to conjointly optimize coverage and energy consumption. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that TP-MADDPG shows significant UAVs-CPP performance contrasted with the advanced benchmarks.","","979-8-3315-4046-3","10.1109/HPCC64274.2024.00085","Research and Development; Research and Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11083206","UAVs Coverage Path Planning (UAVs-CPP);DRL;dam inspection;trace pheromone","Energy consumption;Dams;Disasters;High performance computing;Computer architecture;Inspection;Benchmark testing;Deep reinforcement learning;Path planning;Environmental monitoring","","","","18","IEEE","23 Jul 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We formulate the path planning problem for a cooperative, non-communicating, and homogeneous team of UAVs tasked with maximizing collected data from distributed IoT sensor nodes subject to flying time and collision avoidance constraints. The path planning problem is translated into a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), which we solve through a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, approximating the optimal UAV control policy without prior knowledge of the challenging wireless channel characteristics in dense urban environments. By exploiting a combination of centered global and local map representations of the environment that are fed into convolutional layers of the agents, we show that our proposed network architecture enables the agents to cooperate effectively by carefully dividing the data collection task among themselves, adapt to large complex environments and state spaces, and make movement decisions that balance data collection goals, flight-time efficiency, and navigation constraints.

It generally focuses on coverage completion with less robot (mostly drone) occupation and higher time efficiency. However, as the map becomes larger, most existing works will fail to remain near-optimal due to escalating complexity. In this letter, we formulate the problem as two levels of traveling salesman problem (TSP) to reduce the complexity, where the lower level is single-robot local coverage planning with preset TSP solutions, and the higher level is multiple TSP (mTSP) global planning executed by multiple robots. To better adapt to dynamic scenarios, we apply a distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that allows efficient online computation, and a dense segmented Siamese network (DSSN) to achieve efficient and effective solutions. We show that compared to existing advanced methods, our strategy can effectively solve the problem with coverage costs decreased by over 30$\%$ average and the execution time reduced to seconds in large maps. Furthermore, our network DSSN achieves an additional improvement with random settings to the previous mTSP architecture. We also discuss the influence of different robot densities and separated block sizes on the results, and demonstrate the adaptability to irregular and large-scale obstacles.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2024.3502067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10758196","Path planning for multiple mobile robots or agents;reinforcement learning;planning;scheduling and coordination;complete coverage;large maps","Robots;Robot kinematics;Planning;Costs;Reinforcement learning;Trajectory;Robot sensing systems;Training;Partitioning algorithms;Disasters","","2","","31","IEEE","19 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study proposes a peaking cost quantification method based on multidimensional characterization. In terms of temporal characteristics, the scenario substitution method is used to quantify the participation of different peaking entities in peaking; in terms of spatial characteristics, the initiative constraints of unit peaking are taken into account to ensure that each peaking entity actively participates in peaking and profits from it. Considering the impact of carbon capture power plants’ participation in peak shifting on carbon emission reduction and carbon cost, we constructed a dynamic peak shifting model for multiple subjects. We innovatively construct a two-layer architecture of “spatio-temporal two-dimensional quantization and dynamic game sharing”, and adopt the improved kernel method to establish a coalition reorganization trigger mechanism to solve the unfair sharing of peaking costs when carbon capture power plants participate in peaking. Taking the improved IEEE34 node as an example, the results show that the established cost calculation model can accurately calculate the peak shaving cost of each unit in different scenarios. The total cost of thermal power peak shaving using CCUS is 6.5% lower than that of conventional thermal power units, which significantly verifies the effectiveness of CCUS technology in reducing the economic burden of peak shaving. When the carbon price is 150-250 yuan/ton, the carbon emission is reduced by 40%-50%, which highlights the dual advantages of the model in deep emission reduction and carbon price co-optimization, and the cost increase is  $\le 5$ %, which proves the feasibility of achieving large-scale carbon emission reduction under the premise of strictly controlling the economic cost. On the basis of completing energy conservation and emission reduction, the peak regulation task is completed at the minimum cost, and the unity of economy and environmental protection is achieved. Compared with the Shapley value method, the correlation coefficient of the contribution of the kernel method is increased to 0.91, which indicates that the accuracy of the proposed method for the evaluation of multi-agent contribution is significantly improved, and the fairness of the peak-shifting cost-sharing model of the kernel method is significantly improved, which provides a reliable solution for solving the problem of cost allocation imbalance between traditional power supply and CCUS units.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3585989","Liaoning Provincial Science and Technology Program Joint Fund (Natural Science Foundation-General Project)(grant numbers:2024-MSLH-327); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11071675","Bi-level game optimization;carbon capture optimization;CCUS-new energy synergy;nucleolus allocation;peaking cost dynamics","Costs;Regulation;Carbon dioxide;Carbon capture and storage;Resource management;Optimization;Kernel;Wind power generation;Energy storage;Power system dynamics","","1","","22","CCBY","4 Jul 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this occasion, a virtual community drill for emergency rescue approach is put forward, specifically, this approach utilizes virtual community scenario to simulate the community traffic environment in the real world and discretizes the community environment and the action space of vehicles.

This paper introduces the software architecture used on the On-Board Computer (OBC) for the planned Space-DREAM mission aiming to validate such robotic arm in Lower Earth Orbit (LEO) conducted by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in cooperation with KINETIK Space GmbH and the Technical University of Munich (TUM). During the mission several free motion as well as contact tasks are to be performed in order to verify proper functionality of the robot in position and impedance control on joint level as well as in cartesian control. The tasks are selected to be representative for subsequent servicing missions e.g. requiring interface docking or precise manipulation. The software on the OBC commands the robot's joints via SpaceWire to perform those mission tasks, reads camera images and data from additional sensors and sends telemetry data through an Ethernet link via the spacecraft down to Earth. It is set up to execute a predefined mission after receiving a start signal from the spacecraft while it should be extendable to receive commands from Earth for later missions. Core design principle was to reuse as much existing software and to stay as close as possible to existing robot software stacks at DLR. This allowed for a quick full operational start of the robot arm compared to a custom development of all robot software, a lower entry barrier for software developers as well as a reuse of existing libraries. While not every line of code can be tested with this design, most of the software has already proven its functionality through daily execution on multiple robot systems. The software stack is based on a real time Linux as operating system and the middleware “links and nodes” providing topic communication and service calls as well as process manager functionality. The actual mission software is partitioned into low-level real time control software consisting of a hardware abstraction layer providing telemetry from the robot's joints as well as validating and sending commands from a controller implemented in Simulink. Non-real time modules are responsible for parameterizing the controller and reading camera and other sensor data. A mission script orchestrates the individual tasks by commanding all software components. This mission script is also responsible for tracking subsystem health and potentially disabling erroneous subsystems and is itself monitored by the OBC's hardware watchdog. Finally, a data transmission program ensures prioritized telemetry data transfer to Earth via the spacecraft. Core components of this architecture have already been tested during the 42nd DLR parabolic flight campaign under micro gravity conditions proving their effectiveness and reliability. The detailed software architecture, design choices and software tests will be described in the remainder of the paper.","2996-2358","979-8-3503-5597-0","10.1109/AERO63441.2025.11068537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11068537","","Earth;Space vehicles;Software architecture;Robot vision systems;Arms;Manipulators;Software;Real-time systems;Sensors;Telemetry","","","","26","IEEE","14 Jul 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we specify the nominal behavior offline, through BTs. However, in contrast to previous approaches, we introduce a new type of leaf node to specify the desired state to be achieved rather than an action to execute. The decision of which action to execute to reach the desired state is performed online through active inference. This results in continual online planning and hierarchical deliberation. By doing so, an agent can follow a predefined offline plan while still keeping the ability to locally adapt and take autonomous decisions at runtime, respecting safety constraints. We provide proof of convergence and robustness analysis, and we validate our method in two different mobile manipulators performing similar tasks, both in a simulated and real retail environment.

The optimization-based TAMP with temporal logic specifications is a promising method, but existing works use mixed integer problems (MIP) and do not scale well. To address this issue, in our approach, a new hybrid system model without discrete variables is introduced and combined with smooth approximation methods for STL. This allows the TAMP to be formulated as a nonlinear programming problem whose computational cost is significantly less than that of MIP.

However, they are likely to fail in cluttered scenarios where no collision-free grasping approaches can be sampled without preliminary manipulations. To extend the ability of sampling-based algorithms, we integrate a vision-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) non-prehensile procedure, pusher. The pushing actions generated by pusher can eliminate interlocked situations and make the grasping problem solvable. Also, the sampling-based algorithm evaluates the pushing actions by providing rewards in the training process, thus the pusher can learn to avoid situations leading to irreversible failures. The proposed hybrid planning method is validated on a cluttered bin-picking problem and implemented in both simulation and real world.

This paper presents an adaptive path planning method for intelligent robot arms to be used in dynamic environments. The proposed method is based on a hybrid active-passive approach and has been tested in a dynamic workspace simulation environment.

In the industrial context, bin picking involves the high-speed, accurate, and autonomous handling of randomly placed objects from bins. Enhancing path planning strategies in this area can significantly improve production efficiency, reduce direct labor costs, and improve production rates in automated processes. In this paper, we present a Genetic Algorithm based Adaptive Hybrid Pathfinding Algorithm (AHPFA) that computes the shortest, collision-free path for an industrial robot, thereby minimizing the total time required for path execution and improving overall operational efficiency. The algorithm was tested in simulated and real environments to evaluate its efficacy in finding the shortest path and ensuring collision-free trajectories in 3D obstacle-dense settings. The results from our real-world robot experiments highlight the superior performance of our proposed GA-based AHPFA in terms of the time required for path execution as compared with some of the other metaheuristic algorithms like PSO, ACO, and GA in navigating complex environments in real-time, with each algorithm found to offer distinct advantages and tradeoffs. The proposed algorithm's performance was also assessed based on convergence rate, computational efficiency, and path length metrics.

Intelligent medication management systems based on Internet of Things (IoT) can enhance the system efficiency and largely save labor costs through contactless medication dispensing and robotic item access. A typical medication management system that can store medicines usually includes several cabinets, each cabinet contains several drawers, and each drawer contains medicine boxes. In this paper, we propose, Flexit, a framework of flexible location encoding schemes that can encode the locations of cabinets, drawers, and boxes for efficient item access in an intelligent medication management system.

However, dealing with constraints turns out to be challenging due to many inherent factors, such as inaccessible deformation models of deformable objects (DOs) and varying environmental setups. This article presents a systematic manipulation framework for DOM subject to constraints by proposing a novel path set planning and tracking scheme. First, constrained DOM tasks are formulated into a versatile optimization formalism, which enables dynamic constraint imposition. Because of the lack of the local optimization objective and high state dimensionality, the formulated problem is not analytically solvable. To address this, planning of the path set, which collects paths of DO feedback points, is proposed subsequently to offer feasible path and motion references for the DO in constrained setups. Both theoretical analyses and computationally efficient algorithmic implementation of path set planning are discussed. Lastly, a control architecture combining path set tracking and constraint handling is designed for task execution.

This planning paradigm can lead to unintuitive exploration or replanning latency when entering areas that were previous obstructed from view. To address this we present SceneSense, a real-time 3D diffusion model for synthesizing 3D occupancy information from partial observations that effectively predicts these occluded or out of view geometries for use in future planning and control frameworks. SceneSense uses a running occupancy map and a single RGB-D camera to generate predicted geometry around the platform at runtime, even when the geometry is occluded or out of view. Our architecture ensures that SceneSense never overwrites observed free or occupied space. By preserving the integrity of the observed map, SceneSense mitigates the risk of corrupting the observed space with generative predictions. While SceneSense is shown to operate well using a single RGB-D camera, the framework is flexible enough to extend to additional modalities. Unlike existing models that necessitate multiple views and offline scene synthesis, or are focused on filling gaps in observed data, our findings demonstrate that SceneSense is an effective approach to estimating unobserved local occupancy information at runtime. Local occupancy predictions from SceneSense are shown to better represent the ground truth occupancy distribution during the test exploration trajectories than the running occupancy map.

In this work, these global tibia kinematics define a phase variable impedance controller (PVIC), which is implemented as the nonvolitional base controller within a hybrid volitional control framework (PVI-HVC). The gait progression estimation and biomechanic performance of one able-bodied individual walking on a robotic ankle prosthesis via a bypass adapter are compared for three control schemes: benchmark passive controller, PVIC, and PVI-HVC. The different actuation of each had a direct effect on the global tibia kinematics, but the average deviation between the estimated and ground truth gait percentages were 1.6%, 1.8%, and 2.1%, respectively, for each controller. Both PVIC and PVI-HVC produced good agreement with able-bodied kinematic and kinetic references. As designed, PVI-HVC results were similar to those of PVIC when the user used low volitional intent, but yielded higher peak plantarflexion, peak torque, and peak power when the user commanded high volitional input in late stance. This additional torque and power also allowed the user to volitionally and continuously achieve activities beyond level walking, such as ascending ramps, avoiding obstacles, standing on tip-toes, and tapping the foot. In this way, PVI-HVC offers the kinetic and kinematic performance of the PVIC during level ground walking, along with the freedom to volitionally pursue alternative activities.","","979-8-3503-8457-4","10.1109/ICRA57147.2024.10610930","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10610930","","Legged locomotion;Ankle;Torque;Estimation;Kinematics;Kinetic theory;Impedance","","5","","25","IEEE","8 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, to optimize the collision-allowed trajectories, we present a hybrid solver that integrates sampling- and gradient-based approaches. We evaluate the proposed method on a goal-reaching task in five simulated and real-world environments with different collisional conditions.

This paper introduces STeF-LSTM, a novel hybrid predictive framework that integrates the strengths of Frequency Map Enhancement (FreMEn) for periodic pattern modeling and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for capturing sequential dependencies. By combining FreMEn’s frequency-domain representation to encode long-term rhythmic patterns and LSTM’s robust short-term sequential learning capabilities, the proposed method addresses the limitations of each standalone approach. Evaluations with real-world pedestrian datasets demonstrate significant improvements in prediction accuracy and generalization. STeF-LSTM reduces pattern prediction divergence error by approximately 50%. Further, if the model is applied for motion prediction, the displacement errors decrease by around 7% compared to state-of-the-art methods like CLiFF-LHMP.

The complex dynamics and high-dimensional configuration spaces of deformables, compared to rigid objects, make manipulation difficult not only for multi-step planning, but even for goal specification. Goals cannot be as easily specified as rigid object poses, and may involve complex relative spatial relations such as ""place the item inside the bag"". In this work, we develop a suite of simulated benchmarks with 1D, 2D, and 3D deformable structures, including tasks that involve image-based goal-conditioning and multi-step deformable manipulation. We propose embedding goal-conditioning into Transporter Networks, a recently proposed model architecture for learning robotic manipulation that rearranges deep features to infer displacements that can represent pick and place actions. We demonstrate that goal-conditioned Transporter Networks enable agents to manipulate deformable structures into flexibly specified configurations without test-time visual anchors for target locations.

Our pipeline exploits the inferred missing depth values and depth uncertainty to complement raw depth images and improve the speed and quality of free space mapping.

Recent advances in video to command provide an end-to-end approach to translate a video into robot plans. However, the general video captioning methods focus more on the understanding of the full frame, while they lack the consideration of the spatio-temporal features in videos. In this paper, we proposed the two-stream 2D/3D residual networks for robots to learn manipulation tasks from human demonstration videos. We integrate spatial features with 2D residual network and temporal features with 3D residual network as inputs for RNN layers. An encoder-decoder architecture is then used to encode the spatio-temporal features and sequentially generate the command words. Experimental results on an extended manipulation dataset show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Real-world experiments results on a Baxter robotic arm indicate that our method could produce more accurate commands from video demonstrations.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-9077-8","10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561308","Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9561308","","Training;Three-dimensional displays;Natural languages;Feature extraction;Manipulators;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Task analysis","","5","","28","IEEE","18 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Both approaches generally do not take structural knowledge of the task into account, which is especially prevalent in robotic applications and can benefit learning if exploited. This work introduces a neural network architecture that combines relational inductive bias and visual feedback to learn an efficient position control policy for robotic manipulation. We derive a graph representation that models the physical structure of the manipulator and combines the robot's internal state with a low-dimensional description of the visual scene generated by an image encoding network. On this basis, a graph neural network trained with reinforcement learning predicts joint velocities to control the robot. We further introduce an asymmetric approach of training the image encoder separately from the policy using supervised learning. Experimental results demonstrate that, for a 2-DoF planar robot in a geometrically simplistic 2D environment, a learned representation of the visual scene can replace access to the explicit coordinates of the reaching target without compromising on the quality and sample efficiency of the policy. We further show the ability of the model to improve sample efficiency for a 6-DoF robot arm in a visually realistic 3D environment.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-8671-9","10.1109/IJCNN55064.2022.9892101","ECSEL Joint Undertaking (JU)(grant numbers:826060); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9892101","graph neural networks;reinforcement learning;robot control;inductive bias;convolutional neural networks","Training;Visualization;Three-dimensional displays;Robot kinematics;Robot control;Reinforcement learning;Manipulators","","5","","38","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is therefore necessary to create a methodology to assess robot fleet failure rates to reduce the requirement for costly human intervention. A solution to this problem includes robots with the ability to work together symbiotically to overcome mission resilience challenges. However, robotic platforms generally lack built-in interconnectivity with other platforms from different vendors. This work aims to tackle this issue by enabling the functionality through a bidirectional digital twin. The twin enables the human operator to transmit and receive information to and from the heterogeneous multi-robot fleet. This digital twin considers autonomy for mission resilience and human-led decision making to enable the resilience of a multi-robot fleet. Decision-making within the digital twin triggers the symbiotic digital architecture to preserve mission continuity via adaptive planning in the robotic team. This creates the cooperation, corroboration, and collaboration of diverse robots to leverage the capability via a multi robot fleet, supporting the recovery of a failed robot.

However, moving obstacles with unpredictability in dynamic scenarios, usually increase the difficulty and complexity in collision avoidance of robotic vehicles. To enhance the stability of collision avoidance and boost its adaptability to uncertain dynamic scenes, a new attention-based value classification actor-critic (AVCAC) architecture is proposed. It is an end-to-end robot navigation model that utilizes imperfect local observation to directly plan accurate collision-free motion commands. First, we design a value-classified rollout replaybuffer to categorize the experiences into different pools. It can prevent any overfitting or bias that may result from repeatedly sampling experiences of a certain type during policy learning. Then, we improve the conventional actor-critic network with a multi-head local attention module to extract the local observations at entity-level. This way, the collision avoidance system can focus on key environmental features to operate more efficiently and respond more swiftly to dynamic changes in the environment. Moreover, a lookahead multi-step prediction (LMP) reward setting is devised in the AVCAC-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework to facilitate more informed and forward-looking decision-making. Finally, the policy entropy (PE) and policy delay (PD) are extended to AVCAC model to enhance policy exploration and make policy more robust. Extensive experimental results reveal that our method can generate time-efficient and collision-free guide paths to dodge collisions under complex dynamic environments.","2379-8904","","10.1109/TIV.2024.3391007","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0101400); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973154,U1713209); QingLan Project Funding for Universities in Jiangsu Province, China; National Defense Basic Scientific Research Program of China(grant numbers:JCKY2022209B001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10504956","Robotic vehicle;collision-free navigation;reinforcement learning;value classification;local attention","Collision avoidance;Navigation;Robots;Reinforcement learning;Attention mechanisms","","2","","44","IEEE","18 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Slip-resistant, robust gripping of disc-shaped material during remote manipulation is a challenge in material handling. In a nuclear fuel manufacturing lab, sensitive fuel materials (objects) are handled in the form of a disc (melt) that is pre-cast. Depending on the process treatment, the metal discs are categorized as delicate, hard or soft. The metal discs that were handled by the robotic system and used in the experiment have a diameter of 60mm, a thickness of 15mm, and a weight of 2.3 kg., It is crucial to take care of the paradigms like grip force, profile and perception of slide for job planning and management of a robot in a hazardous radioactive environment. A multi-sensory tactile array is designed indigenously and fabricated by utilising commercial sensors attached to the prototype gripper so as to make it an intelligent instrumented-jaw gripper. The custom-built tactile sensory system is made up of a) force sensing resistors (FSRs) in a specific array, b) a matrix of FSR in the centre, c) PVDF (Polyvinylidene Fluoride) sensors in the perimeter and d) infrared (IR) sensors placed in a predetermined architecture. The mounting of the customized gripper sensory system includes a 3x2-array of FSRs and other sensors, each having a spatial resolution of 5 mm and a sensing area of $15,000 mm^{2}$. While PVDF sensor is employed for dynamic contact point estimation, texture recognition is accomplished using high frequency response. An integrated form of proximity and ambient light sensor is utilised (mimicing distance sensor) to detect the presence of an object and improve gripper alignment during grasping. This sensor-instrumented processing was achieved through microcontroller-based programming and allied electronics, such as scanning the array & storing the data. LabView® was used to record the digital signals and analysis of time-spanned raw data. Calibration was carried out to ensure that the acquired data was repeatable and reliable. The paradigms of indigenous development of the integrated sensory system for the gripper as well as its calibration, dynamic features and response characteristics are discussed in this paper. The tactile matrix has a force range of 30N, a resolution of 0.3N and a sensitivity of 0.5V/N., The FSR sensors produced a nonlinear relationship at various force ranges and the hysteresis therein was found to vary with load range and frequency. At lower frequencies of 0.2 and 0.8 Hz, cycle drift was significant, with a maximum inaccuracy in force value of 0.5 N. The force measuring inaccuracy of normal force was less than 5% at sensitive places. Based on the repeated experimentation, the developed matrix sensor was entrusted to have nearly 95% accuracy rate in recognising different textures. The developed tactile sensor matrix was found to be robust and it has good reproducibility in parameters like contact force measurement, contact point estimate, slip detection and texture recognition, according to the experimental results. To not withstanding benefits the developed tactile sensor system was also comprehended with few on-job limitations, signaling run-time error conditions.","","978-1-6654-3323-5","10.1109/IRIA53009.2021.9588669","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9588669","tactile sensor;robot;gripper;FSR;PVDF","Force measurement;Service robots;Force;Tactile sensors;Metals;Sensor systems;Sensors","","2","","7","IEEE","4 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indeed, the stochastic nature of the underlying environment dynamics makes it an interesting research field for statistical learning approaches and neural policies. In this work, we introduce a novel attention-based neural architecture capable of solving a smoothing task for such objects by means of a single robotic arm. To train our network, we leverage an oracle policy, executed in simulation, which uses the topological description of a mesh of points for representing the object to smooth. In a second step, we transfer the resulting behavior in the real world with imitation learning using the cloth point cloud as decision support, which is captured from a single RGBD camera placed egocentrically on the wrist of the arm. This approach allows fast training of the real-world manipulation neural policy while not requiring scene reconstruction at test time, but solely a point cloud acquired from a single RGBD camera. Our resulting policy first predicts the desired point to choose from the given point cloud and then the correct displacement to achieve a smoothed cloth. Experimentally, we first assess our results in a simulation environment by comparing them with an existing heuristic policy, as well as several baseline attention architectures. Then, we validate the performance of our approach in a real-world scenario.

To address this, model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) presents a promising approach for enabling agents to make decisions under uncertainty. In this paper, we investigate the control policy of a flexible endoscope using Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA) platform. We design a flexible tendon-driven robotic endoscope (TDRE) and develop a custom simulation environment within SOFA to train DRL agents. Our approach involves implementing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to approximate an optimal policy for trajectory planning. The optimal policy facilitates trajectory tracking tasks for the TDRE’s end-effector, such as circle trajectories and action disturbances, without requiring fine-tuning policy network parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves near real-time performance (30 FPS). The feedforward neural network of the policy provides feedback, enabling closed-loop control of TDRE. Furthermore, our experiments show that the navigation success rate of TDRE exceeds 90% within a tolerant error of 3 mm in free space.

In essence, a robotic sailboat uses digital control systems to perform the same tasks that adjust the course of a traditional vessel, such as sail control and rudder actuation. The advantage of using a simulation environment such as Gazebo for this purpose is that its open-source nature allows code from different developers to be compiled and incorporated for various purposes such as the implementation of sensors or environmental variables, like wind and swell, inside the simulation. Furthermore, the package architecture that ROS uses enables a modular modeling of the different parts, mechanisms, and systems of the sailboat.

To address such challenges, we propose an autonomous robotic Raman spectroscopy system synergized with a computer vision system, an AI-based learning approach, and a motion planning algorithm. We then developed a proof-of-concept demo using a Raman sensor mounted ad-hoc on a 6-DoF robot arm, an RGB-D camera, a conveyor system, and printed/natural salmon fillets, emulating a lab-scale industrial environment. All software architecture is implemented using the ROS framework and open-source Python libraries. Our robot-sensor integration solution can provide promising results, as the robotic system allows for faster and more accurate measurements of omega-3 fatty acid content in salmon fillets moving over the conveyor belt at low and high speeds, improving operational efficiency, and scaling the business.","2161-8089","979-8-3503-2069-5","10.1109/CASE56687.2023.10260492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10260492","","Service robots;Raman scattering;Robot vision systems;Production;Robot sensing systems;Libraries;Software measurement","","","","22","IEEE","28 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this model exhibits significant randomness, which results in limited training effectiveness and low control efficiency. To address these issues, this article proposes an improved deep  $Q$ -network (IM-DQN) approach for intelligent control of the robot’s arm motion. A prioritized experience replay mechanism is employed in the construction of the motion control data experience pool. By using an optimal experience retention strategy and exploration suppression rate, the approach effectively prevents the rapid expansion of the experience pool and avoids network collapse. Furthermore, a dual neural network architecture is introduced, where motion control data and experience pool data are processed separately, aligning the learning process with the reward structure. A Markov decision process (MDP) is applied to establish the motion control model for the coal gangue picking robot’s manipulator, converting the robotic arm path planning problem into a Markov decision problem. Additionally, an intrinsic curiosity module (ICM) is incorporated into the model to enhance motion control, thereby improving convergence speed, control accuracy, and overall performance. Comparative experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms traditional reinforcement learning approaches by preventing network collapse, ensuring control stability, generating shorter and more accurate motion paths for the robotic arm, and improving trajectory accuracy by 17.6% and reducing average path length by 26.2% versus DQN baselines.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2025.3610955","Tianjin Science and Technology Plan Project(grant numbers:23YDTPJC00290); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11176899","Deep reinforcement learning;intrinsic curiosity module (ICM);prioritized experience replay;robotic manipulator control","Manipulators;Robots;Sorting;Motion control;Hands;Training;Robot kinematics;Coal;Belts;Accuracy","","","","32","IEEE","23 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The decentralised use of solid biomass in combination with heat pumps and heat storage in hybrid systems could therefore play an important role. This can be particularly relevant in rural areas where the possibility of a district heating network is not available. Accordingly, it is even more crucial to manage this growing number of decentralised energy assets in order to avoid problematic grid conditions. Cellular energy systems are discussed as a method to organise the high com-plexity of numerous within itself complex systems in the grid from the bottom up. The modelling and mathematical optimisation of such cellular structured systems requires a detailed knowledge of the internal processes and thus a highly sophisticated implementation. A direct feedback between optimal operation and optimal planning is particularly important here, as the optima are interdependent. For this, the concept of a 2-stage optimisation approach of the local aspect is presented in this paper, which additionally considers the autonomous and subsidiary properties of the cellular approach within multi-agent systems. This leads to a value-optimised combination of the cellular approach and solid biomass-based (hybrid) systems with the goal of maximising the impact of the limited potential of biogenic residues.","","978-3-8007-6108-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172994","","","","","","","","4 Jul 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

In contrast, topological maps are computationally efficient but lack the semantic richness necessary for a more complete understanding of the environment. Inspired by a population code in the postrhinal cortex (POR) strongly tuned to spatial layouts over scene content rapidly forming a high-level cognitive map, this work introduces Topo-Field, a framework that integrates Layout-Object-Position (LOP) associations into a neural field and constructs a topometric map from this learned representation. LOP associations are modeled by explicitly encoding object and layout information, while a Large Foundation Model (LFM) technique allows for efficient training without extensive annotations. The topometric map is then constructed by querying the learned neural representation, offering both semantic richness and computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations in multi-room environments demonstrate the effectiveness of Topo-Field in tasks such as position attribute inference, query localization, and topometric planning, successfully bridging the gap between high-fidelity scene understanding and efficient robotic navigation.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2025.3559836","Shanghai Technology Development and Entrepreneurship Platform; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10960688","Bioinspired robot learning;cognitive map;mapping;neural field;representation Learning","Layout;Semantics;Three-dimensional displays;Robots;Navigation;Planning;Encoding;Training;Path planning;Neural radiance field","","","","37","IEEE","10 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Offline-Programming (OLP) can be used to generate robot programs in a virtual environment and speed up the programming process with supportive functionalities. However, much human input is still needed to optimize robot programs for a specific painting task. The human operator uses his cognitive skills and experience based on process-specific rules to adapt the programming within the OLP system. The programming approach is an iterative process where the painting quality resulting from an initial robotic program is assessed in a laboratory, and then the program is adapted in the OLP system. It is difficult to model human decisions directly using closed-loop algorithmic approaches. Therefore, we propose five approaches based on machine learning to substitute human intervention throughout the programming process and allow for automatic and optimal robot program generation.

Our framework consists of two modules: a) a learning-based prediction module to predict a human’s future goal position, and b) a classical control theory-inspired reconstruction module to reconstruct a possible future trajectory or a set of possible future positions using the predicted future goal position.

The linear feedback control mechanism is not sufficient to control vehicle maneuver with precision, thus it summons research of adaptive control approach. An adaptive control strategy is most often deployed to control system with unknown plant model or a system with minimal information. The objective of the proposed hybrid control strategy is to deal with non-linearity in the actuation system with minimum tuning effort. An iterative back-stepping mechanism is used to design model reference adaptive control to aid vehicle maneuver. The aim of this paper is to analysis the stability of non-linear lateral dynamics through iterative back-stepping. The proposed controller performance meets the expectation of functionality while driving within the designed system constraints of lateral motion dynamics. This research work deals with the erratic system which remains unstable whenever value of reference signal becomes reasonably high. The adjustable parameters provided in the control input signal of adaptive lateral control aids to control such abrupt changes in motion dynamics specifically in multiple curvature road.

Because of the high computational complexity of MAPF, several powerful techniques have been developed to reduce the runtime under assumptions, such as the ideal kinematics of point-like agents and a discretized time domain. However, these assumptions restrict the applicability of the MAPF algorithms to real-world scenarios. Continuous-time conflict-based search (CCBS), a variant of CBS, was recently proposed to generalize MAPF problems to continuous-time and non-grid domains. In this study, we propose CCBS with partitioned groups of agents (CCBS-PGA), a hybrid approach that uses CCBS as the main MAPF solver and adopts the idea of prioritized planning (PP) for enhanced scalability. CCBS-PGA runs CCBS for each group of the partitioned agents and assigns unique priorities to the individual group. We also introduce two features that reflect realistic robot kinematics; rotational velocities of robots and safety distances. This approach does not rely on the simplified assumptions while alleviating the computational complexity of MAPF problems involving numerous agents. We demonstrate its effectiveness in various environments using differential-wheeled robots.","","979-8-3503-3517-0","10.1109/UR57808.2023.10202470","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10202470","","Runtime;Service robots;Scalability;Robot kinematics;Search problems;Safety;Planning","","3","","32","IEEE","8 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article presents switching multitier control (SMC) to exploit edge computing for industrial control. SMC dynamically optimizes control performance by switching between local and edge controllers in response to changing network conditions. SMC employs a data-driven approach to derive switching policies based on classification models trained based on simulations while guaranteeing system stability based on an extended Simplex approach tailored for two-tier platforms.

We consider a feature as several local surfaces that have the same kinds of characteristics. A standard geometry can be defined by attributes abstracted from a set of features. For the regular geometry of the same category, descriptions and topological relations about these objects’ features are known before modeling tasks. In order to maximize the acquisition of an object’s surface in a few views, knowledge of its features is employed as partial prior information that guides the view planning in active reconstruction. Since each reconstruction task may have a different type of object to be rebuilt, in order to make the view planning algorithm suitable for different tasks, we store the prior information of the object in a fixed-form database, so as to call the content of the library to perform verification and reasoning of all features, and make predictions on unknown local surface and rough shape of the object. The predicted unknown surface is discretized and then marked as predicted voxels in the voxel space, which are used to evaluate the priority of all candidate viewpoints, together with the detected voxels. A novel hybrid optimization function is proposed that takes the constraint on overlap, the accessibility of predicted surface, and the amount of unknown object surface into account.

To address complex geometry/static hybrid constraints at the rigid platforms, a general framework is developed for the kinetostatics modeling and analysis. Benefiting from the redundant actuation design, the Cartesian stiffness of the studied PCM can be further adjusted as a secondary task to positioning. Utilizing the proposed deflection-based force sensing method, the external load exerted on the end-effector can also be identified by measuring the pose of rigid platforms. To validate the proposed design, a prototype is built, on which a series of experiments have been conducted. The results show that, with the proposed kinetostatics models, the prototype exhibits a mean position and orientation error of 0.52 mm and 0.41°. Finally, the capability of stiffness-varying and force-sensing is demonstrated to verify the feasibility and potential applications of the designed redundant PCM.Note to Practitioners—This paper is motivated by the need for more adaptable robotic systems in industrial and interactive settings. In this work, a novel redundant parallel continuum manipulator with variable passive compliance and force-sensing capability is presented. This planar manipulator comprises four flexible limbs, each driven by independent linear modules, thus the redundancy in the actuation can be leveraged for varying Cartesian stiffness. By means of measuring the pose of the end-effector, the interaction force exerted on the end-effector can be identified according to the force sensing model. The structural compliance of the manipulator enhances safety in human-robot collaboration, while variable stiffness accommodates the specific requirements of different interaction tasks. Furthermore, the force-sensing capability allows for precise feedback control, significantly improving safety during interactions with humans. Therefore, the presented PCM has the potential for interactive manipulation applications, including delicate and fragile object handling, as well as human-robot collaboration in assembly tasks.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2024.3398214","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFA0709001); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52022056,51875334); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM)(grant numbers:21NL2600200); Zhejiang Laboratory Open Research Project(grant numbers:K2022NB0AB03); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10529977","Parallel continuum manipulator;kinetostatics analysis;actuation redundancy;variable stiffness;force sensing","Robot sensing systems;Force;Task analysis;Sensors;Robots;Phase change materials;Computational modeling","","1","","46","IEEE","13 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper introduces an innovative method for achieving adjustable loads during resistance training by leveraging physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI). The primary objective is to regulate targeted muscle activation through the use of Robo-Coach (robotic coach system). We first utilize a Task-Parameterized Gaussian Mixture Model (TP-GMM) to learn the motion of coach demonstration, which can be generalized for the trainees. The 3D path extracted from the generated trajectory is then projected onto a 2D plane with respect to the direction of the load. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid stiffness/position generator for online task execution. This generator determines the desired positions in the 2D plane according to the contact point displacements in the stimuli direction and, simultaneously, sets the desired stiffness based on the muscle activation feedback.

However, existing reinforcement learning methods still face multiple challenges in complex environments, such as sparse rewards, insufficient exploration, slow convergence, and limited generalization capabilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes an improved version of the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm. The algorithm incorporates an n-step return mechanism to enhance the modeling of long-term dependencies, and introduces a dynamic hybrid exploration strategy that combines Gaussian noise with Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) noise to improve exploration stability and training efficiency. In addition, a shaped reward function is constructed by integrating several key factors, including distance to the target, heading alignment, obstacle avoidance, and time efficiency, to provide continuous feedback during the learning process. The proposed method is validated on the Gazebo simulation platform. Experimental simulation results show that, compared to the original algorithm, the improved version increases the success rate by 37% in complex static environments and by 28% in dynamic obstacle scenarios.

While this modular organization seems crucial for the learning of complex motor skills and the flexible adaption of behavior to new circumstances, the problem of learning meaningful, compositional abstractions from sensorimotor experiences remains an open challenge. Here, we introduce a computational learning architecture, termed as surprise-based behavioral modularization into event-predictive structures (SUBMODES) that explores behavior and identifies the underlying behavioral units completely from scratch. The SUBMODES architecture bootstraps sensorimotor exploration using a self-organizing neural controller. While exploring the behavioral capabilities of its own body, the system learns modular structures that predict the sensorimotor dynamics and generate the associated behavior. In line with recent theories of event perception, the system uses unexpected prediction error signals, i.e., surprise, to detect transitions between successive behavioral primitives. We show that, when applied to two robotic systems with completely different body kinematics, the system manages to learn a variety of complex behavioral primitives. Moreover, after initial self exploration the system can use its learned predictive models progressively more effectively for invoking model predictive planning and goal-directed control in different tasks and environments.","2379-8939","","10.1109/TCDS.2019.2925890","German Research Foundation for the project “Development of the agentive self” in the framework of the Priority Program “The Active Self”(grant numbers:BU 1335/11-1); DFG Cluster of Excellence EXC 2064/1(grant numbers:390727645); Feodor Lynen Research Fellowship of the Humboldt Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8753716","Developmental robotics;event cognition;self-organizing behavior;sensorimotor learning;skill acquisition and planning","Predictive models;Robot sensing systems;Planning;Encoding;Task analysis;Transient analysis","","8","","67","IEEE","2 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, in addition to the requirement to develop an aerial platform suitable for operations on Mars, autonomous navigation strategies and robust controllers are also needed for exploration tasks.

Consequently, learning from rewards has provided meaningful results in applications involving human-robot interaction. In those cases where the robot's state space and the number of actions is extensive, dimensionality becomes intractable and this drastically slows down the learning process. This effect is specially notorious in one-step temporal difference methods because just one update is performed per robot-environment interaction. In this paper, we prove how the action-based learning of a social robot can be improved by combining classical temporal difference reinforcement learning methods, such as Q-learning or Q( λ), with a probabilistic model of the environment. This architecture, which we have called Dyna, allows the robot to simultaneously act and plan using the experience obtained during real human-robot interactions. Principally, Dyna improves classical algorithms in terms of convergence speed and stability, which strengthens the learning process. Hence, in this work we have embedded a Dyna architecture in our social robot, Mini, to endow it with the ability to autonomously maintain an optimal internal state while living in a dynamic environment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3095392","Robots Sociales para Estimulación Física, Cognitiva y Afectiva de Mayores (ROSES); Innovación y Universidades and RoboCity2030-DIH-CM through the Ministerio de Ciencia; Madrid Robotics Digital Innovation Hub(grant numbers:S2018/NMT-4331); Programas de Actividades I+D en la Comunidad de Madrid; Structural Funds of the European Union (EU); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9476021","Action learning;decision-making;human–robot interaction;probabilistic model;reinforcement learning;social robots","Robots;Reinforcement learning;Task analysis;Collision avoidance;Navigation;Probabilistic logic;Stability analysis","","7","","63","CCBY","7 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The planning problem for exploration requires determining the best locations for future measurements that will enhance the fidelity of the map, for example, by reducing its total entropy. A widely-studied technique involves computing the Mutual Information (MI) between the current map and future measurements, and utilizing this MI metric to decide the locations for future measurements. However, computing MI for reasonably-sized maps is slow and power hungry, which has been a bottleneck towards fast and efficient robotic exploration. In this paper, we introduce a new hardware accelerator architecture for MI computation that features a low-latency, energy-efficient MI compute core and an optimized memory subsystem that provides sufficient bandwidth to keep the cores fully utilized. The core employs interleaving to counter the recursive algorithm, and workload balancing and numerical approximations to reduce latency and energy consumption. We demonstrate this optimized architecture with a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation, which can compute MI for all cells in an entire 201-by-201 occupancy grid (e.g., representing a 20.1m-by-20.1m map at 0.1m resolution) in 1.55 ms while consuming 1.7 mJ of energy, thus finally rendering MI computation for the whole map real time and at a fraction of the energy cost of traditional compute platforms. For comparison, this particular FPGA implementation running on the Xilinx Zynq-7000 platform is two orders of magnitude faster and consumes three orders of magnitude less energy per MI map compute, when compared to a baseline GPU implementation running on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 platform. The improvements are more pronounced when compared to CPU implementations of equivalent algorithms.","2153-0866","978-1-6654-1714-3","10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636603","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9636603","","Energy consumption;Multicore processing;Current measurement;Computer architecture;Bandwidth;Real-time systems;Energy efficiency","","3","","26","IEEE","16 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As NASA and its partners' capabilities for human exploration of deep space continue to mature, it is necessary to understand the capability gaps that require closure to support future habitation systems, such as the Lunar Surface Habitat (SH) and Mars Transit Habitat (TH) currently in concept development. This paper will identify high-priority capability gaps for exploration habitation and show potential options for gap closure through investment in technology, development, and testing. High-priority capability gaps are divided into the following general taxonomy areas: human health/life support/habitation systems, flight computing and avionics, power and energy storage, communications and navigation, thermal management systems, human exploration destination systems, autonomous systems, sensors and instruments, GNC (guidance, navigation, and control), robotic systems, ground and uncrewed surface systems, and materials/structures/mechanical systems/manufacturing. In the gap identification process, teams of discipline experts from across NASA reviewed the latest habitation architecture needs against current capabilities to understand where gaps may exist. The results of the assessment established a basis for the current state-of-the-art within each gap and identified the capability needs of the proposed exploration missions the gap links to. An assessment of how each test platform (e.g., Ground, International Space Station (ISS), Commercial Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Gateway) may be leveraged to mature capabilities and potentially provide a route to gap closure will be discussed. The notional timeline for gap closure to support reference missions and impacts to overall schedule are also assessed where appropriate. Based on the capability gap analysis described above, the paper summarizes important technology maturation considerations for human exploration architectures, with a focus on the Mars TH. The previously published NASA habitation ground rules and assumptions document is used as the basis to classify gaps as enabling, enhancing, or “push” opportunities for a particular architecture. Stepwise technology maturation plans/considerations are presented for some selected critical gaps. Overall, the analysis in this paper is intended to help influence development priorities for habitation systems, where high-priority, critical gaps are those currently assessed as having a low probability of closure by the anticipated need date. Capability gap analysis also informs the risk register for exploration habitation systems and mitigation strategies to ensure readiness of key technologies to support future mission timelines. Linkage between capability gaps for Moon and Mars is noted, as closure of a gap at a Lunar destination may subsequently enable or enhance Mars TH architectures.","1095-323X","978-1-6654-9032-0","10.1109/AERO55745.2023.10115856","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10115856","","Mars;Navigation;NASA;Moon;Taxonomy;Low earth orbit satellites;Computer architecture","","2","","33","USGov","15 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve on-line navigation on resource-constrained platforms, a fair amount of research has been devoted to develop real-time SLAM accelerators. However, most existing accelerators have the following limitations: (1) relying on hand-crafted visual features, which cannot offer robust feature association in complex environments; (2) only recovering sparse points of the observed scene, which are not adequate for high-level tasks such as obstacle avoidance and path planning. In this paper, we present EDS-SLAM, an energy-efficient and robust architecture for real-time dense stereo SLAM system based on learned feature matching to achieve real-time visual localization and dense mapping reconstruction. To achieve both resource efficiency and perception robustness, EDS-SLAM utilizes a share-used binary neural network (BNN) architecture to perform not only key-points association for computing robust camera poses, but also stereo matching for obtaining high-quality mapping. In EDS-SLAM, we design a set of dedicated, well optimized accelerators to achieve real-time implementations for the pipelines of stereo matching, feature extraction and key-point association. The effectiveness of EDS-SLAM is evaluated through comprehensive experiments. Compared to the state-of-the-art dense SLAM system with software-based implementation, EDS-SLAM achieves comparable accuracy on the localization but higher precision dense 3D mapping with up to $2.03\times$ speed-up as well as up to $23.1\times$ energy efficiency improvement, respectively.","1558-2434","979-8-3503-2225-5","10.1109/ICCAD57390.2023.10323734","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10323734","","Location awareness;Visualization;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Three-dimensional displays;Navigation;Computer architecture;Real-time systems","","1","","30","IEEE","30 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While deep-learning-based semantic segmentation approaches have reached outstanding performance in recent years, they demand large amounts of labeled data for training. Inspired by modern Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) techniques, in this paper, we introduce a two-step training pipeline specifically tailored to challenging natural scenes, where the availability of annotated data is often quite limited. Our strategy involves the initial training of a powerful domain adaptive architecture, followed by a refinement stage, where segmentation masks predicted by the Segment Anything Model (SAM) are used to improve the accuracy of the predictions on the target dataset. These refined predictions serve as pseudo-labels to supervise the training of a final distilled architecture for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments conducted in two real-world scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, we show that our pipeline enables the training of a MobileNetV3 that achieves significant mIoU gains of 3.60% and 11.40% on our two datasets compared to the DAFormer while only demanding 1/15 of the latter’s inference time.

However, current implementations face significant challenges. Individual intelligence tasks require isolated knowledge retrieval pipelines. This isolation results in redundant data flows, inconsistent interpretations, and increased operational complexity. Inspired by the service model unification efforts in Open-RAN that promote interoperability and vendor diversity, we propose UnifiedKP: a unified Network Knowledge Plane specifically designed for large model-enabled autonomous 6G network intelligence. By decoupling network knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence logic, UnifiedKP streamlines development workflows and significantly reduces maintenance complexity for intelligence engineers. Through an intuitive and consistent knowledge interface, UnifiedKP enhances interoperability for network intelligence agents while maintaining semantic consistency across diverse intelligence tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of UnifiedKP through two representative intelligence applications: live network knowledge question-answering and edge AI service orchestration. Experimental results show that UnifiedKP reduces knowledge retrieval latency by 47%, improves knowledge consistency by 82%, and decreases development complexity by 65% compared to traditional isolated approaches. Our framework achieves 94.3% accuracy in network anomaly detection and reduces service orchestration time by 38% in dynamic edge computing environments.

However, there is currently no reliable means of accurate and instantaneous navigation in the vicinity of the Moon. This poses operational limitations on the autonomy of lunar robotic and small satellite missions. We present the preliminary results of a systems architecture study conducted on a new satellite navigation system orbiting the Moon that would effectively extend the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) space service volume to cislunar space. We constrain the analysis to lunar frozen orbits under J2, C22 and third-body perturbations, to achieve stable lunar orbits. The problem formulation includes the following design decisions: (1) Orbit semi-major axis, (2) Number of satellites, (3) Number of orbital planes, (4) Satellite phasing in adjacent planes, (5) Orbit eccentricity and (6) Argument of periapsis. The Borg Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) is used to optimize the satellite constellation design using multiple crossover and mutation operators that can adaptively be selected at runtime. The fitness function takes into account performance, cost, availability and station-keeping delta-V. Specifically, the performance metric assessment is based on the Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP), which is computed over a grid of 500 equidistant points on the lunar surface. The input satellite orbits used in the GDOP computation are obtained from high-fidelity orbit propagation using NASA's General Mission Analysis Toolbox (GMAT). The space segment cost model considers satellite constellation development and production costs. Single satellite costs are based on satellite dry mass estimates derived from the power budget analysis assuming a satellite lifetime of 10 years. The results of the study show that high-performing Lunar GNSS constellations relying on frozen orbits alone can be achieved with 20 satellites but they may be suboptimal for high-latitude regions.","2153-3598","978-1-7281-0244-3","10.1109/PLANS46316.2020.9110202","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9110202","Global Navigation Satellite Systems;Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization;Frozen orbits;Cislunar space","Space vehicles;Global navigation satellite system;Satellite constellations;Satellites;Costs;Moon;NASA;Systems architecture;Orbits;Space exploration","","9","","18","IEEE","8 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose a Neural Potential Field: a neural network model that returns a differentiable collision cost based on robot pose, obstacle map, and robot footprint. The differentiability of our model allows its usage within the MPC solver. It is computationally hard to solve problems with a very high number of parameters. Therefore, our architecture includes neural image encoders, which transform obstacle maps and robot footprints into embeddings, which reduce problem dimensionality by two orders of magnitude. The reference data for network training are generated based on algorithmic calculation of a signed distance function. Comparative experiments showed that the proposed approach is comparable with existing local planners: it provides trajectories with outperforming smoothness, comparable path length, and safe distance from obstacles.","","979-8-3503-8457-4","10.1109/ICRA57147.2024.10611635","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10611635","","Costs;Trajectory planning;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Predictive models;Vectors;Planning","","4","","58","IEEE","8 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When the problem is over-constrained or infeasible, a fundamental issue is to detect a minimal subset of variables and constraints that are infeasible. Previous approaches require solving several nonlinear programs, incrementally adding and removing constraints, and are thus computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a graph neural architecture that predicts which variables and constraints are jointly infeasible. The model is trained with a dataset of labeled subgraphs of Factored-NLPs, and importantly, can make useful predictions on larger factored nonlinear programs than the ones seen during training. We evaluate our approach in robotic manipulation planning, where our model is able to generalize to longer manipulation sequences involving more objects and robots, and different geometric environments.

The current survey study aims to provide researchers with an interdisciplinary perspective on time perception. First, we introduce a brief background from the psychology and neuroscience literature, covering the characteristics and models of time perception and related abilities. Second, we summarize the emergent computational and robotic models of time perception. A general overview to the literature reveals that a substantial amount of timing models are based on a dedicated time processing like the emergence of a clock-like mechanism from the neural network dynamics and reveals a relationship between the embodiment and time perception. We also notice that most models of timing are developed for either sensory timing (i.e., ability to assess an interval) or motor timing (i.e., ability to reproduce an interval). The number of timing models capable of retrospective timing, which is the ability to track time without paying attention, is insufficient.

In order for humanity to create a sustainable lunar presence, well-developed collaboration between humans and robots is necessary to perform complex tasks. This paper presents a methodology to assess the human factors, situational awareness (SA) and cognitive load (CL), associated with teleoperated assembly tasks. Currently, telerobotic assembly on an extraterrestrial body has never been attempted, and a valid methodology to assess the associated human factors has not been developed. The Telerobotics Laboratory at the University of Colorado-Boulder created the Telerobotic Simulation System (TSS) which enables remote operation of a rover and a robotic arm. The TSS was used in a laboratory experiment designed as an analog to a lunar mission. The operator's task was to assemble a radio interferometer. Each participant completed this task under two conditions, remote teleoperation (limited SA) and local operation (optimal SA). The goal of this experiment was to establish a methodology to accurately measure the operator's SA and CL while performing teleoperated assembly tasks. A successful methodology would yield results showing greater SA and lower CL while operating locally. Performance metrics measured in this experiment showed greater SA and lower CL in the local environment, supported by a 27% increase in the mean time to completion of the assembly task when operating remotely. Subjective measurements of SA and CL did not align with the performance metrics. This brought into question the validity of the subjective assessments used in this experiment when applied to telerobotic assembly tasks. Results from this experiment will guide future work attempting to accurately quantify the human factors associated with telerobotic assembly. Once an accurate methodology has been developed, we will be able to measure how new variables affect an operator's SA and CL in order to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of telerobotic assembly tasks.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-2734-7","10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172667","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9172667","","Atmospheric measurements;Moon;Human factors;Radio interferometry;Extraterrestrial measurements;Particle measurements;Manipulators","","2","","35","IEEE","21 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Immersive technologies, such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality have proven to be powerful tools for immersing users in realistic, interactive, and engaging environments. This paper explores how the Simulation and Graphics Branch at NASA’s Johnson Space Center (JSC) leverages immersive technology, modern commercial rendering engines, and physics-based systems simulations to develop human-in-the-loop systems for humanity’s return to the Moon through the Artemis program.When NASA returns to the Moon, astronauts will travel to the Moon’s South Pole where lighting conditions will cause a more complex operational environment. Human-in-the-loop simulations play a crucial role in NASA’s mission planning, spacecraft and space systems development, and evaluation of operational scenarios. The development of immersive environments such as a lunar rover mockup at a video wall enables engineers and astronauts to simulate and experience mission scenarios, integrated spacecraft systems, and operational procedures in a relevant environment before deployment. By integrating realistic virtual environments, immersive technology allows for the visualization and interaction with virtual spacecraft models, mission landscapes, and complex operational tasks. This approach helps identify potential design flaws, operational challenges, and safety considerations. It also provides valuable insights for risk reduction and helps improve mission efficiency and effectiveness. With advanced motion tracking systems and custom virtual environments, data can be gathered and evaluated to help NASA refine training protocols, develop specialized training procedures, and optimize human-robotic interactions for future space missions. Furthermore, immersive technology offers opportunities for future training initiatives at NASA.The Virtual Reality Laboratory at JSC has pioneered training with Virtual Reality (VR) since the Hubble Space Telescope repair missions in the early 1990’s. Extended Reality (XR) simulations enable astronauts to rehearse complex spacewalks, spacecraft maneuvers, and extravehicular activities in a safe and controlled environment. By replicating the physical and cognitive challenges of space missions, immersive training experiences enhance astronauts’ situational awareness, decision-making abilities, and adaptability to unexpected scenarios. Additionally, immersive technology facilitates collaborative training, allowing geographically dispersed crew and mission control personnel to engage in synchronized simulations, fostering teamwork and effective communication.The adoption of immersive technology in NASA’s testing, evaluation, and future training programs has yielded significant benefits. By incorporating human-in-the-loop simulations for studies involving Extra Vehicular Activities (EVA), surface mobility and landing systems, NASA can identify and mitigate risks, optimize operational procedures, and enhance mission success. Ultimately, immersive simulation experiences can empower astronauts to better navigate the complexities of space missions, ensuring their safety, productivity, and success in the dynamic and challenging environments they will experience at the Lunar South Pole.","1095-323X","979-8-3503-0462-6","10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10521209","","Training;Space vehicles;South Pole;Space missions;Moon;NASA;Virtual environments","","2","","21","USGov","13 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Automated transportation brings numerous benefits to human beings. However, the concerns such as safety, security, and privacy keep rising. In navigation and trajectory planning, the AVs require exchanging sensory information from their own and other AVs. In such cases, when a malicious AV or faulty sensor-equipped AV comes into connectivity, it can have disruptive consequences. This paper proposes a Hybrid Deep Anomaly Detection (HDAD) approach for effective anomaly detection and cyber-attack mitigation in AVs. The Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm in HDAD approach acts over the 6G network to combat new-age cyber-attacks and provide a swift and accurate anomaly detection mechanism. In conjunction with Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MaxEntIRL), the HDAD approach identifies and isolates malicious AVs. It is envisioned that the obtained results prove the effectiveness of HDAD and have an 8.2% higher accuracy rate than the existing systems.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2022.3188304","NGNLab; Department of Computer Technology; Anna University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9815151","6G-V2X;autonomous vehicles;anomaly detection;hybrid deep reinforcement learning;multi-agent reinforcement learning;maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning","Anomaly detection;6G mobile communication;Behavioral sciences;Security;Reinforcement learning;Real-time systems;Entropy","","46","","39","IEEE","4 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional optimizations like genetic algorithms struggle with computational complexity and dynamic planning. Meanwhile, pure multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)—a type of machine learning where multiple agents learn to optimize their decisions through interactions with each other and the environment—faces the curse of dimensionality and communication overhead, which limits the large-scale deployment of dynamic vehicular networks. This paper proposes an innovative approach to joint spectrum allocation and power control within dense V2X networks, conceptualizing it as an MARL-based multi-objective optimization problem. To mitigate computational demands, we adopt a hybrid approach combining centralized-training-with-decentralized-execution paradigm, alongside parameter-sharing techniques, within classic Mean-Field MARL (MF-MARL) framework, and name it Scalable-V2X-MF-MARL (ScalV-MF-MARL), enabling a lightweight training process in dense V2X networks with numerous V2V agents. It also technically encodes observations and mean field of actions, thereby enhancing the model's dynamism and scalability. This advancement permits the application of a single model across varying vehicle densities. Experimental results demonstrate that ScalV-MF-MARL achieves 99.5% of the performance of density-specific MF-MARL models, while reducing GPU memory usage by 79.49% to 94.03% during training as vehicle number increases from 40 to 160. Additionally, it outstrips conventional algorithms. Its generalization capabilities across diverse V2X network densities facilitate training in less dense scenarios, with seamless application to denser networks. In conclusion, ScalV-MF-MARL streamlines the V2X network deployment and effectively handles dynamic changes in vehicle numbers.","2379-8904","","10.1109/TIV.2024.3422506","Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Ubiquitous Data Enabling(grant numbers:ZDSYS20220527171406015); Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program(grant numbers:2021ZT09L197); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20220530143013030); Shenzhen 2022 Stabilization Support Program(grant numbers:WDZC20220811103500001); Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School-Shenzhen Pengrui Young Faculty Program; Shenzhen Pengrui Endowed Professorship Scheme of Shenzhen Pengrui Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10584331","Resource allocation;dense V2X networks;mean-field theory;multi-agent reinforcement learning;scalable model","Vehicle-to-everything;Resource management;Training;Vehicle dynamics;Quality of service;Optimization;Computational modeling","","3","","61","IEEE","3 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has emerged as a key technology to improve spectral efficiency (SE) by allowing multiple IoT devices (IDs) to share the same frequency resource block through power-domain multiplexing. However, as the number of IDs increases, NOMA faces significant interference challenges, which limit its scalability and degrade system performance. To address these limitations, we propose a clustered NOMA (C-NOMA) framework, which organizes IDs into clusters and applies NOMA within each cluster, reducing interference and improving the effectiveness of successive interference cancellation (SIC). Additionally, we integrate hybrid beamforming (HBF) with C-NOMA, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serve as mobile base stations using 2D uniform planar array (UPA) antennas for beam steering. This enables multiple IDs to be served within each cluster with fewer RF chains, further enhancing SE through spatial multiplexing and beam steering. In order to solve the energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem, we reformulate the optimization problem of HBF and power allocation (PA) as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve it using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Simulation results show that our proposed Full-RL algorithm achieves up to 37.7 % higher EE compared to the baseline RL-based PA method. This baseline only uses RL for PA and relies on the averaged phase for analog beamforming without further optimization.","1938-1883","979-8-3315-0521-9","10.1109/ICC52391.2025.11160899","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11160899","Non-orthogonal multiple access;air-ground network;deep reinforcement learning;hybrid beamforming","Radio frequency;NOMA;Base stations;Beam steering;Interference cancellation;Array signal processing;Energy efficiency;Internet of Things;Resource management;Optimization","","","","16","IEEE","26 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to satisfy the data transmission requirements of extensive satellites, this paper formulates the channel allocation problem, which aims at maximizing the overall transmitted data value by allocating different medium earth orbit (MEO) beams in different time slots to different LEO satellites. Since the data generation states of LEO satellites are hybrid constant and stochastic, the MEO satellites could allocate channels more timely than the ground mission center, and the action space for channel allocation is too large, the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning based algorithm is consequently adopted to solve the channel allocation problem.

With the vision of 6G framework, we employ Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) flock and introduce the concept of AUV-based network. In particular, we utilize the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technique to update the controllability of the AUV-based network, leading to the paradigm of SDN-enabled multi-AUVs network Intelligent Transportation Systems (SDNA-ITS). For SDNA-ITS, we utilize artificial potential field theories to model the control model. To optimize the system output, we introduce the graph-based Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, i.e., a category of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) mechanism where each AUV can be regarded as a node in a graph. In particular, we improve the optimization model based on Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) architecture with the assistance of the SDN controller, by which each AUV can efficiently adjust its speed towards the diffusion source. Further, to achieve exact path planning for detecting the diffusion source, a dynamic detection scheme is proposed to output the united control policy to schedule the SDNA-ITS dynamically.

Existing learning-based MAPF approaches typically only let each agent make decisions based on a limited field-of-view (FOV) around its position, as a natural means to fix the input dimensions of its policy network. However, this often makes policies shortsighted, since agents lack the ability to perceive and plan for obstacles/agents beyond their FOV. To address this challenge, we propose ALPHA, a new framework combining the use of ground truth proximal (local) information and fuzzy distal (global) information to let agents sequence local decisions based on the full current state of the system, and avoid such myopicity. We further allow agents to make short-term predictions about each others’ paths, as a means to reason about each others’ path intentions, thereby enhancing the level of cooperation among agents at the whole system level. Our neural structure relies on a Graph Transformer architecture to allow agents to selectively combine these different sources of information and reason about their inter-dependencies at different spatial scales.

On the other hand, physics-based models provide high safety guarantees for the predicted trajectory but lack accuracy. The method presented in this paper targets this trade-off. We introduce a method to predict the trajectories of opposing racecars with deep neural networks considering physical constraints to restrict the output and to improve its feasibility. We report the method’s performance against an LSTM-based encoder-decoder architecture on data acquired from multi-agent racing simulations. The proposed method outperforms the baseline model in prediction accuracy and robustness. Still, it fulfills quality guarantees of smoothness and consistency of the predicted trajectory and prevents out-of-track predictions. Thus, a robust real-world application of the model with high prediction accuracy is proven.

So far, mostly non-learning algorithms like reservation or optimization-based ones were proposed to solve the underlying multi-agent planning problem. At the same time, automated driving functions for a single ego vehicle are increasingly implemented using machine learning methods. In this work, we build upon a previously presented graph-based scene representation and graph neural network to approach the problem using reinforcement learning. The scene representation is improved in key aspects by using edge features in addition to the existing node features for the vehicles. This leads to an increased representation quality that is leveraged by an updated network architecture. The paper provides an in-depth evaluation of the proposed method against baselines that are commonly used in automatic intersection management. Compared to a traditional signalized intersection and an enhanced first-in-first-out scheme, a significant reduction of traversal duration is observed at varying traffic densities. Finally, the generalization capability of the graph-based representation is evaluated by testing the policy on intersection layouts not seen during training. The model generalizes virtually without restrictions to smaller intersection layouts and within certain limits to larger ones.","","978-1-6654-6880-0","10.1109/ITSC55140.2022.9922515","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9922515","","Training;Machine learning algorithms;Roads;Layout;Reinforcement learning;Network architecture;Planning","","6","","22","IEEE","1 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Crew operations benefit from a spectrum of machine assistance to complete replacement of dangerous or highly repetitive tasks. Many science operations have a teleoperation component, and similarly benefit from a range of autonomy implementations that make long distance applications feasible. As we consider longer duration deep space missions, we also consider higher levels of autonomy in order meet emergent safety, maintenance, and logistics needs. One of the challenges within this scope is installation and maintenance of infrastructure, such as large scale instrumentation and communications equipment, crew habitats, and operational facilities. We describe how a programmable meta-material architecture may shift the paradigm of how we design, build, and operate future space infrastructure and assets. A primary objective of this strategy is to free the design space from launch vehicle constraints and fundamentally shift how a mission is designed and conducted. This integrates advances in materials (mechanical meta-materials), manufacturing (cooperative mobile robotics), and autonomy (multi-agent planning algorithms). Engineering systems that utilize a modular and reconfiguration building block approach, such as digital communication and computation systems, currently lead in terms of size and complexity scalability. NASA is extending the benefits and flexibility of digital systems to hardware systems, to optimize materials life-cycle management and expand our space exploration mission capabilities to meet long duration and deep space infrastructure needs, in accordance with long term NASA goals of “in-space reliance” and “mass-less exploration.”","1095-323X","978-1-6654-9032-0","10.1109/AERO55745.2023.10115601","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10115601","","Assembly systems;Space missions;NASA;Computer architecture;Maintenance engineering;Aerospace electronics;Hardware","","5","","15","USGov","15 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These systems usually involve contextual information related to users and devices, which may put constraints on the presentation of multimedia documents. An effective solution consists in adapting their contents according to the current context. Most of existing adaptation approaches try to select, compose and execute adaptation services in order to provide adapted documents. Even so, they, however, do not address the need to deal with dynamic environments for which there does not exist a global view about the available services. Also, they do not care about the increasing number of users' requests. These aspects have a direct influence on the quality of service. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel self-organizing multi agent based architecture for adapting multimedia documents. The agents cooperate in a decentralized structure to optimize the selection, composition and execution of service plans. The self-organization of the system is ensured by updating the structural relations between the agents according to trust values.

Most prominently limited crew size, limits on crew time and utilization, as well as the costs of 24/7/365 operations are the main drivers for innovations towards increased autonomy. Furthermore, in the future, when considering destinations beyond lunar orbit, signal delay simply prevents the conventional operational concept of real-time monitoring and control for crewed missions. To overcome those challenges, this paper will introduce METIS, the Mars Exploration Telemetry-driven Information System. METIS is a novel intelligent assistant enabling autonomous operations of crewed spacecraft based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). METIS is currently being developed at the Columbus Control-Center (Col-CC), which is part of the German Space Operations Center (GSOC). On behalf of the European Space Agency (ESA), Col-CC is responsible for the operation of the Columbus module of the International Space Station (ISS). Columbus was launched on February 7, 2008, docked to the ISS a few days later on February 11 and has been a part of the ISS since then. It is the basis on which METIS is developed. The assistant is designed after John L. Boyds OODA (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) loop for human decision making, where each function in the model is developed as an individual computerized agent. This paper will introduce the high-level system architecture of this multi-agent-system (MAS), as well as human interaction embedded in the system. Furthermore, we will show each of the agents in greater detail, their functions and the interaction between the agents. Since some agents rely on machine learning (ML) from the field of artificial intelligence (AI) we use multiple data sources from the Columbus module, including but not limited to on-board telemetry, operational data files (ODFs, i.e. procedures), and anomaly reports, to train and test the system. We will highlight how these data sources are brought together and the database we deploy to enable access to the data in a machine-readable format. Since METIS is intended to be used by both ground personnel, as well as on-board crew, we will show how METIS is planned to be utilized within Col-CC and on-board. For this we envision a step-wise approach, where METIS is first used and tested in conjunction with the Columbus simulator to perform certain ground and on-board activities and react to a set of known anomalies. In this first step ground controllers will still be heavily involved in development, to identify areas that need further improvements and further increase the capabilities of the system. This work represents a significant step towards full crew autonomy by supporting quick and reliable decision making in the highly dynamic environment that is human space exploration. AI/ML enabled solutions to new and old challenges have the potential to revolutionize the space sector and METIS represents one possible contribution to make space more accessible to humans, increase system reliability, reduce cost of operations and help prepare for deep space exploration beyond lunar orbit.","1095-323X","979-8-3503-0462-6","10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10521154","","Space vehicles;Costs;Soft sensors;Decision making;Systems architecture;Real-time systems;Orbits","","1","","39","IEEE","13 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While traffic regulations provide clear boundaries, real-world scenarios remain unpredictable due to the complex interactions between vehicles. This challenge has driven significant interest in learning-based approaches for trajectory prediction. We present MMTraP: Multi-Sensor and Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction in BEV. This method integrates camera, LiDAR, and radar data to create detailed Bird's-Eye-View representations of driving scenes. Our approach employs a hierarchical vector transformer architecture that first detects and classifies vehicle motion patterns before predicting future trajectories through spatiotemporal relationship modeling. This work specifically focuses on vehicle interactions and environmental constraints. Despite its significance, multi-agent trajectory prediction and moving object segmentation are still underexplored in the literature, especially in real-time applications. Our method leverages multisensor fusion to obtain precise BEV representations and predict vehicle trajectories. Our multi-sensor fusion approach achieves the highest vehicle Intersection over Union (IoU) of 63.23% and an overall mean IoU (mIoU) of 64.63%, demonstrating its effectiveness in utilizing all available sensor modalities. Additionally, we demonstrate vehicle segmentation and trajectory prediction capabilities across various lighting and weather conditions. The proposed approach has been rigorously evaluated using the nuScenes dataset. Results show that our method improves the accuracy of trajectory predictions and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, particularly in challenging environments such as congested urban areas. For instance, in complex traffic scenarios, our approach achieves a relative improvement of 5% in trajectory prediction accuracy compared to baseline methods. This work advances vehicle-focused prediction systems by integrating multi-sensor BEV representation and interaction-aware transformers. Our approach shows promise in enhancing the reliability and accuracy of trajectory predictions for autonomous driving applications, potentially improving overall safety and efficiency in diverse driving environments.","2644-1330","","10.1109/OJVT.2025.3574385","Science Foundation Ireland(grant numbers:18/CRT/6049); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11016806","Sensor fusion;encoder-decoder transformer;bird's-eye-view;semantic segmentation, multi-agent trajectory prediction","Trajectory;Radar;Autonomous vehicles;Cameras;Laser radar;Accuracy;Sensor fusion;Motion segmentation;Computer vision;Meteorology","","1","","84","CCBY","28 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Results: FHIR has been exploited to design a structured history of a real patient affected by renal cell carcinoma. A simulator has been developed for automating the whole testing process represented by specific scenarios of the patient’s history. Conclusions: The simulator relies on the events produced by the Case Manager for coordinating the agents. This proved to be effective in checking that the agents reactions to new data showing up on the blackboard comply with the expected behavior.","2158-8481","978-1-6654-4280-0","10.1109/MELECON53508.2022.9843001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9843001","Health technology assessment;distributed system testing;patient coaching;mHealth","Medical devices;Microprocessors;Semantics;Computer architecture;Medical services;Regulation;History","","1","","13","IEEE","3 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The platform is based on the concept of Emergent Intelligence (EI), inspired by theory of complex adaptive systems, based on self-organization processes with non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The fundamentals, functionality and architecture of the developed EI platform are discussed. The core functionality of ARMS is to make adaptive resources allocation, planning and optimization, combined with monitoring and control of resources in real time.

The pickup and delivery stages are modelled as variable task queues, with no a priori information about the inflow into the production queues. The proposed solution coordinates the movement of a group of mobile agents operating between the two stages in a reactive and scalable manner, so that the material is transported from multiple production queues to multiple delivery queues in a balanced/equalized manner. In such a scenario, centralized planners suffer from low reactivity and poor scaling, as the number of agents and number of queues increases. To overcome this problem, we propose a decentralized approach comprising of two separate auction-based task distribution systems for the production and delivery stages, along with behavior-tree based management of agent autonomy and task bidding. Each auction system tracks the length of production/delivery queues and solves the optimal task assignment, based on the bids submitted by the agents. The agents participate in one of the two auction systems at any given time, based on the status of the behavior tree executing the two-stage tasks. We analytically show that the proposed decentralized auctioning approach along with agent autonomy and bidding managed by behavior trees, offers better scalability and reactiveness compared to the centralized approach. The proposed methodology is experimentally validated in a lab environment, in three illustrative material flow management scenarios, using TurtleBot3 robots as agents.","2153-0866","979-8-3503-7770-5","10.1109/IROS58592.2024.10801900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10801900","","Scalability;Robot kinematics;Mobile agents;Production facilities;Time-varying systems;Intelligent robots;Floors","","1","","12","IEEE","25 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The MAPF community has largely focused on developing high-performance heuristic search methods. Recently, several works have applied various machine learning (ML) techniques to solve MAPF, usually involving sophisticated architectures, reinforcement learning techniques, and set-ups, but none using large amounts of high-quality supervised data. Our initial objective in this work was to show how simple large-scale imitation learning of high-quality heuristic search methods can lead to state-of-the-art ML MAPF performance. However, we find that, at least with our model architecture, simple large-scale (700k examples with hundreds of agents per example) imitation learning does not produce impressive results. Instead, we find that by using prior work that post-processes MAPF model predictions to resolve 1-step collisions (CS-PIBT), we can train a simple ML MAPF policy in minutes that dramatically outperforms existing ML MAPF policies. This has serious implications for all future ML MAPF policies (with local communication) which currently struggle to scale. In particular, this finding implies that future learnt policies should always (1) use smart 1-step collision shields (e.g, CS-PIBT) and (2) include the collision shield with greedy actions as a baseline (e.g. PIBT), as well as (3) motivates future models to focus on longer horizon / more complex planning as 1-step collisions can be efficiently resolved.","","979-8-3315-4139-2","10.1109/ICRA55743.2025.11128836","National Science Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:2328671); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11128836","","Imitation learning;Search methods;Reinforcement learning;Predictive models;Planning;Robotics and automation","","","","45","IEEE","2 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most existing studies on UAV-assisted networks mainly focus on partial components of sensing, communication, and computation, without fully considering their joint impact, leading to difficulties in ensuring end-to-end information freshness. To address this problem, building upon the concept of Age of Information (AoI), we specifically design Task-oriented AoI (TAoI). This metric enables a comprehensive evaluation of information timeliness across the entire processing pipeline, from raw sensing data to final results, by accounting for factors such as sensing update intervals, transmission failures, and computation delays. Based on the TAoI metric, we further develop a joint trajectory and task scheduling scheme to ensure the freshness of sensing data.

Central to our approach is the formulation of an injective virtual embedding induced by rotations from the actual agent positions. This embedding serves as a structure-preserving map around which all agent stabilize their relative positions and permits the use of well-established linear control techniques. We construct the embedding such that it is topologically equivalent to the desired trajectory (i.e., a homeomorphism), thereby preserving the stability characteristics.

Conventional autonomous driving approaches struggle to address these challenges due to inherent limitations in pattern disambiguation, computational efficiency, and temporal modeling. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes SC-DVHT (Spectral-Constraint Dynamic Vehicle Heterogeneous Traffic framework), which establishes a dynamic spectral-spatiotemporal joint modeling architecture for effective decoupling of multi-scale driving characteristics:(1)The dynamic spectral-constraint mechanism confines behavioral cycles to physically interpretable from 3 to $T / 2$ intervals to suppress both high-frequency noise artifacts and low-frequency pseudo-periodic disturbances;(2)Asymmetric convolutional kernel assemblies coupled with sparse attention gating mechanisms collaboratively extract micro-scale maneuvers (e.g., steering angles) and macro-scale tactical patterns (e.g., overtaking frequencies);(3)Multi-granularity contextual modeling integrates second-level instantaneous behaviors with minute-level strategic evolution, enabling holistic intention reasoning that “captures both granular details and global patterns”.Experimental results demonstrate that in heterogeneous highway environments, TemporalNet outperforms the Decentralized Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) MARL algorithm (iPLAN) by $11.7 \%$ in survival duration and $9.1 \%$ in success rate under moderate traffic conditions. When benchmarked against QMIX - the widelyused CTDE (Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution) framework in multi-agent reinforcement learning - the proposed method demonstrates superior performance in moderate traffic conditions, exhibiting a $1.37 \%$ extension in operational duration, $13.27 \%$ enhancement in mission completion efficiency, and $7.72 \%$ improvement in motion continuity maintenance. Notably, in chaotic traffic scenarios, SC-DVHT exhibits $0.8 \%$ and $7.4 \%$ improvements in survival time and success rate over iPLAN, respectively. These findings confirm that spectral-spatiotemporal joint modeling significantly enhances robustness of intention perception in complex traffic environments, establishing a novel paradigm for high-density dynamic driving decisionmaking systems.","","979-8-3315-4407-2","10.1109/ICBDSE65491.2025.11220132","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11220132","Autonomous driving;MARL;Spectralspatiotemporal joint modeling","Training;Uncertainty;Computational modeling;Strategic planning;Robustness;Trajectory;Vehicle dynamics;Transient analysis;Autonomous vehicles;Context modeling","","","","18","IEEE","4 Nov 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides, we propose a new online pseudo-label harvesting algorithm that decomposes the distribution of a hybrid distance measure between quads and PC into two components. This technique does not need manual threshold selection and intuitively encourages quads to align with reliable layout points. Surprisingly, this framework also works for the fully-supervised setting, achieving a new SOTA on the ScanNet benchmark. Last but not least, we also push the semi-supervised setting to the realistic omni-supervised setting, demonstrating significantly promoted performance on a newly annotated ARKitScenes testing set.

After the unforeseen outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the public demand for delivery services has increased. Mobile robotic systems inherently offer the potential for minimizing the amount of direct human-to-human interactions within the parcel delivery process. In this paper, we apply a system-level perspective for identifying key challenges and promising solution approaches for modeling, analysis, and optimization of UAV-aided parcel delivery. We present a system-of-systems model for UAV-enhanced parcel delivery to cope with higher capacity requirements induced by the COVID-19. The proposed system-of-systems consists of various complex aspects such as assigning and distributing delivery jobs, establishing and maintaining reliable communication links between the vehicles, as well as path planning and mobility control. In a proof of concept evaluation, we simulate the logistics performance and network communications of a hybrid delivery fleet composed of ground and aerial vehicles operating under pandemic induced constraints, such as the prioritization of time-critical deliveries like medical goods. Results indicate that network requirements for reliable communications within the delivery fleet can be met by existing network communications approaches. Furthermore, gains in delivery capacity induced by drone usage and a trade-off caused by prioritizing time-critical goods, therefore, resulting in a penalty for regular deliveries, are observed.","2472-9647","978-1-6654-4439-2","10.1109/SysCon48628.2021.9447142","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9447142","","COVID-19;Pandemics;Scheduling algorithms;Path planning;Time factors;Reliability;Surges","","12","","26","IEEE","9 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To improve the generality and effectiveness of multigripper planar grasping algorithms, we propose a grasping framework featuring gripper-agnostic scene inference and gripper-changeable optimization. In our approach, we introduce an interaction probability map that bridges the scene inference and grasp optimization modules. It efficiently decouples the learning of grasping knowledge and modeling of gripper's kinematics. The inference module adopts a modified directional ensemble method with a generated fingertip dataset to refine scene information. In grasp optimization, we formulate gripper-kinematic constraints for different grippers according to joint types. Extensive evaluations on the Cornell Grasping Dataset (with a success rate of 95.51%) and on multifingered grippers (ten grippers in the real world) demonstrate that our hybrid approach generalizes learnable knowledge across various grippers.

For descending we propose a rappelling approach using tethering and actively controlled hybrid legged-wheels on the exploration rover. The rover uses path planning to avoid obstacles on its way down the vertical surface. When the bottom of the skylight is reached, the tether spool is deployed as docking station.

Recent efforts have attempted to address these challenges via data-driven methods, learning dynamical models in combination with model predictive control. Those methods, while effective, rely solely on minimizing forward prediction errors to hope for better task performance with MPC controllers. This weak correlation can result in data inefficiency as well as limitations to overall performance. In response, we propose a novel strategy: using a policy gradient algorithm to find a simplified dynamics model that explicitly maximizes task performance. Specifically, we parameterize the stochastic policy as the perturbed output of the MPC controller, thus, the learned model representation can directly associate with the policy or task performance. We apply the proposed method to contact-rich tasks where a three-fingered robotic hand manipulates previously unknown objects. Our method significantly enhances task success rate by up to 15% in manipulating diverse objects compared to the existing method while sustaining data efficiency. Our method can solve some tasks with success rates of 70% or higher using under 30 minutes of data.

Smooth coordination through communicating needs, plans, and actions is essential for effective teamwork. However, the impacts of different communication mediums on human factors and assembly cycle time in these hybrid teams remain in initial research stages. While direct physical communication channels, like buttons, allow for communicating the needs of a collaborative human partner, this active medium may increase operator workload and stress. In contrast, indirect visual mediums where robots interpret human behavior may reduce active control demands. Evaluating communication effects is critical as Industry 5.0 aims to improve human well-being by facilitating closer human-machine cooperation. This study compared active, direct communication through physical buttons with passive, indirect communication visually through AI-based robot observation and decision-making. 50 participants completed an assembly task across three conditions: no robot assistance, robot assistance via a direct physical medium, and assistance via an indirect visual medium (AI observing and deciding robot actions). Mental workload and stress were assessed using heart rate variability and reaction times. Assembly cycle times were manually recorded. Results showed a 17% reduction in subjective mental workload with the visual communication medium compared to manual assembly for 64% of participants. HRV analysis indicated lower stress levels in both collaborative conditions compared to manual assembly, with the physical button interface showing the lowest stress levels overall. Assembly times averaged 5% faster with AI-controlled visual communication versus direct button control. These results suggest AI-enabled visual communication better optimizes human wellbeing and productivity, which could play a key role for Industry 5.0 goals in transitioning towards closer and more harmonious human-robot collaboration.","","979-8-3503-8672-1","10.1109/CogMI62246.2024.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10835665","Human-Robot Collaboration;Industry 5.0;Communication Medium;Human Factors","Productivity;Visual communication;Service robots;Robot kinematics;Collaboration;Human factors;Manuals;Fifth Industrial Revolution;Heart rate variability;Assembly","","1","","24","IEEE","16 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there is an inherent lack of reliability in AM processes, particularly common in extrusion or deposition-based methods due to the stochastic nature of ma-terial deposition. This necessitates an intelligent manufacturing solution to address the drawbacks of AM. Thus, we propose a novel layer-wise approach toward closed-loop AM, which is capable of in-situ monitoring and repairing geometric defects. In this paper, we present a system that uses a robotic AM experimental platform that mimics a conventional open-loop fabrication setup, which we augment into a closed-loop system using two add-ons: in-situ inspection subsystem and online process correction subsystem. The in-situ inspection subsystem collects 3D point cloud scans and compares them against a reference CAD model, categorizing geometric deviations as positive or negative defects. Then the subsequent online process correction subsystem uses a re-plan and/or repair strategy to address the positive and/or negative defects, respectively. To evaluate this idea, we conducted three experiments on parts with manually induced defects to investigate the system's ability to repair those parts, thereby reducing defects, improving part accuracy, and enhancing mechanical properties. Comparing the defective and repaired parts, we observe a reduction in defect percent by volume from 10.7% to 1.3%, an improvement in geometric tolerance from 3.86% error to 0.08% error, and an increase in the part's breaking load from 4.77 kN to 6.31 kN. These experiments prove that our layer-wise closed-loop additive manufacturing approach improves the quality, tolerance, and reliability of plastic 3D printed parts, with the potential to extend to other extrusion/deposition-based AM processes, or even subtractive manufacturing and hybrid manufacturing methods.","2153-0866","978-1-6654-9190-7","10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10342148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10342148","","Fabrication;Point cloud compression;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Stochastic processes;Maintenance engineering;Inspection","","1","","21","IEEE","13 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The present letter focuses on the low-level control of the non-prehensile pushing action aimed at moving planar objects of generic shape along a given path with an assigned time law. Based on the continuous and nonlinear dynamics of the system, we propose a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC), which avoids the need for linearization and, thus, the hybrid dynamics arising from it. An extensive comparison with a state-of-the-art linear MPC demonstrates that the NMPC can successfully react to more general disturbances, outperforming the linear one.

One of the reasons is the actuator's ability to infer the applied torque by measuring the deflection of the elastic element as opposed to directly with dedicated torque sensors. Proper deflection control is pinnacle to achieve a desired output torque and, therefore, small deviances in positional measurements or a nonlinear deformation can have adverse effects on performance. In applications with larger torque requirements, the actuators typically use gear reductions which inherently result in mechanical backlash. This combined with the nonlinear behaviour of the elastic element and unmodelled dynamics, can severely compromise force fidelity.This paper proposes a backlash compensating active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) for multi-input series elastic actuators. In addition to proper deflection control, a multiinput active disturbance rejection controller is derived and implemented experimentally to mitigate any unmodelled nonlinearities or perturbations to the plant model. The controller is experimentally validated on a hybrid motor-brake-clutch series elastic actuator and the controller performance is compared against traditional error-based controllers. It is shown that the backlash compensated ADRC outperforms classical PID and ADRC methods and is a viable solution to positional measurement error in elastic actuators.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-7395-5","10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9196657","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9196657","","Actuators;Torque;Springs;Brakes;DC motors;Sea measurements;Hysteresis motors","","","","24","IEEE","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound reconstruction and new view image synthesis, which can assist in diagnosis and reexamine, have significant potential in teleultrasound, especially integrating robotic ultrasound systems (RUSS). Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), an impressive reconstruction method, requires long training times, limiting its practicality in ultrasound. Despite NeRF variants achieving faster optimization, their performance remains confined to natural scene reconstructions. To address this limitation, we propose HFUS-NeRF, a hybrid representation method designed for fast and accurate ultrasound reconstruction. HFUS-NeRF integrates multi-resolution hash-grid and tri-plane representations to represent each sampling point of the ultrasonic wave. A unified model for sampling points from different ultrasonic probes is presented to simulate the wave's propagation through tissues, and the final ultrasound image is rendered using volume rendering. Compared with NeRF-based ultrasound reconstruction, both the hash grid and triplane resolutions can be scaled up more efficiently, improving reconstruction speed. Experimental results demonstrate that HFUS-NeRF enhances reconstruction quality while significantly reducing reconstruction time to mere minutes. Furthermore, we validated HFUS-NeRF's adaptability by reconstruction using images from different types of ultrasound probes, and real-world experiments confirmed its feasibility and transferability, enabling fast ultrasound reconstruction on human subjects.","","979-8-3315-4139-2","10.1109/ICRA55743.2025.11128742","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11128742","","COVID-19;Training;Ultrasonic imaging;Three-dimensional displays;Rendering (computer graphics);Neural radiance field;Acoustics;Probes;Image reconstruction;Robots","","","","19","IEEE","2 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, PDFactor decomposes 3D point cloud into three orthogonal feature planes and leverages a tri-perspective view transformer to produce dense cubic features as a latent diffusion field aligned with observation space representing 6-DoF action probability distribution at an arbitrary location. We employ a small denoising network conceptually as both a parameterized loss function measuring the quality of the learned latent features and an action gradient decoder to sample actions from the latent diffusion field during inference. This design enables our PDFactor to benefit from spatial awareness of explicit representation and arbitrary resolution of implicit representation, rendering it with manipulation accuracy, inference efficiency, and model scalability. Experiments demonstrate that PDFactor outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across a diverse range of manipulation tasks in RLBench simulation.

However, the crowdedness and oc-clusions in the cluttered scenario cause significant difficul-ties to generate valid grasp poses without collisions, which results in low efficiency and high failure rates. To address these, we present a generic framework called GE-Grasp for robotic motion planning in dense clutter, where we leverage diverse action primitives for occluded object removal and present the generator-evaluator architecture to avoid spatial collisions. Therefore, our GE-Grasp is capable of grasping objects in dense clutter efficiently with promising success rates. Specifically, we define three action primitives: target-oriented grasping for target capturing, pushing, and nontarget-oriented grasping to reduce the crowdedness and occlusions. The gen-erators effectively provide various action candidates referring to the spatial information. Meanwhile, the evaluators assess the selected action primitive candidates, where the optimal action is implemented by the robot. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods of grasping in clutter with respect to motion efficiency and success rates. Moreover, we achieve comparable performance in the real world as that in the simulation environment, which indicates the strong gen-eralization ability of our GE-Grasp.

The proposed system forms the search strategy using the state-of-the-art control concept, dual control for exploitation and exploration, and realises such a function in the aforementioned challenging scenario using an RRT* based path planner.

When the environments are unknown, prior motion planning for navigation may not always be available. This article presents a novel Sim-to-Real method to guide a cable-driven soft robot in a static environment under the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA). The scenario aims to resemble one of the steps during a simplified transoral tracheal intubation process where a robotic endotracheal tube is guided to the upper trachea–larynx location by a flexible video-assisted endoscope/stylet. In SOFA, we employ the quadratic programming inverse solver to obtain collision-free motion strategies for the endoscope/stylet manipulation based on the robot model and encode the virtual eye-in-hand vision. Then, we associate the anatomical features recognized by the virtual vision and the joint space motion using a closed-loop nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model (NARX) network. Afterward, we transfer the learned knowledge to the robot prototype, expecting it to navigate to the desired spot in a new phantom environment automatically based on its eye-in-hand vision only. Experiment results indicate that our soft robot can efficaciously navigate through the unstructured phantom to the desired spot with minimal collision motion according to what it has learned from the virtual environment. The results show that the average R-squared coefficient between the closed-loop NARX-forecasted and SOFA-referenced robot's cable and prismatic joint space motion are 0.963 and 0.997, respectively.

As the area to be explored increases, so does the time it takes for robots to explore it. One approach to reduce the required time is using multiple autonomous robots to perform distributed exploration. However, this significantly increases the associated cost and the complexity of the exploration process. To address these issues, in the past we proposed a leader-follower architecture where multiple two-wheeled passive robots capable of steering only using brakes are pulled by a leader robot. By controlling their relative angle with respect to the leader, the followers could move in arbitrary formations. The proposed follower robots used rubber tires, which allowed it to perform well in rigid ground, but poorly in soft soil. One alternative is to use lugged wheels, which increase the traction in soft soils. In this letter we propose a robot with shape-shifting wheels that allow it to steer in both rigid and soft soils. The wheels use a cam mechanism to push out and retract lugs stored on its inside. The shape of the wheel can be manipulated by controlling the driving torque exerted on the cam mechanism. Through experiments we verified that the developed mechanism allowed the follower robots to control their relative angle with respect to the leader in both rigid and soft soils.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2020.3010495","JAXA's Space Exploration Innovation Hub Center; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9144396","Multi-robot systems;mechanism design;wheeled robots","Wheels;Mobile robots;Force;Torque;Resistance;Shape","","16","","19","IEEE","20 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

CabiNet is a collision model that accepts object and scene point clouds, captured from a single-view depth observation, and predicts collisions for SE(3) object poses in the scene. Our representation has a fast inference speed of 7μs/query with nearly 20% higher performance than baseline approaches in challenging environments. We use this collision model in conjunction with a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) planner to generate collision-free trajectories for picking and placing in clutter. CabiNet also predicts waypoints, computed from the scene's signed distance field (SDF), that allows the robot to navigate tight spaces during rearrangement. This improves rearrangement performance by nearly 35% compared to baselines.

In Ulgen, a system is implemented as a collection of asynchronous processes executing RTA modules which are generalizations of the well-known Simplex architecture. An RTA module is composed of a set of safe controllers (SCs), designed to guarantee certain safety specifications, and a set of advanced controllers (ACs), optimized for performance, each defined to run under the specific conditions of the operating environment, and a decision module implementing the switching logic between the controllers. A source of complexity in achieving safe CPS is that these systems often involve concurrently interacting components with different execution semantics. To this end, Ulgen allows for the definition of RTA modules with either event-driven or time-driven execution semantics and encapsulates such components into RTA modules. It further provides primitives for implementing priority-based communication between asynchronous processes, which is a necessary feature for task prioritization mechanisms, such as contingency plans and interrupt service routines. The framework also provides formal guarantees on the safe execution of RTA modules based on a formal definition of well-formedness. In Ulgen, a well-formed RTA module combines SCs and ACs in a way that guarantees the underlying safety specifications assured by the SCs while delivering the desired performance offered by the ACs. We compare the safety guarantees of Ulgen against other state-of-the-art RTA frameworks and demonstrate its efficacy in implementing safe and performant CPS by presenting an extensive experimental evaluation of five case studies both in a simulation environment and on a real robotic platform.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2023.3246386","NSF(grant numbers:1545126 (VeHICaL),1837132); DARPA(grant numbers:FA8750-18-C-0101 (AA)); Berkeley Deep Drive; C3.ai Digital Transformation Institute; Toyota through the iCyPhy Center; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10048006","Cyber–physical systems (CPSs);formal methods;robotics;runtime assurance (RTA);runtime verification","Batteries;Safety;Runtime;Task analysis;Switches;Computer architecture;Programming","","5","","42","CCBY","17 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With this approach, governments and healthcare institutions can plan for such diseases in the future. This article presents a compact computational model (CCM) to identify and control different COVID-19 variants using IoT-networked robots. The CCM comprises seven physiological variables (PVs) and robotic identification (RI) of infected individuals as alternative intervention strategies. This study uses Market Place Service Robots that correctly identify PV and RI for positively infected individuals. The conditions of the existence and the solution of the deterministic model are derived from a compact flow architecture that we develop. We show that the model has COVID-19-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium. While PV with appropriate isolation and hospital treatment reduces the COVID-19 disease impact by 19% more than RI alone, this study also shows that combining two PV with RI minimizes the impact better than PV or RI alone, by 36% and 43%, respectively. When the PV control parameters are increased, up to 5, in the presence of IoT and RI, up to 99.99% improvement is seen.

Building on the foundation of Fractal Impedance Control (FIC) introduced in our previous work, this paper presents a novel extension to dualarm tele-cooperation, leveraging the non-linear stiffness and passivity of FIC to adapt to diverse cooperative scenarios. Unlike traditional impedance controllers, our approach ensures stability without relying on energy tanks, as demonstrated in our prior research. In this paper, we further extend the FIC framework to bimanual operations, allowing for stable and smooth switching between different dynamic tasks without gain tuning. We also introduce a telemanipulation architecture that offers higher transparency and dexterity, addressing the challenges of signal latency and low-bandwidth communication. Through extensive experiments, we validate the robustness of our method and the results confirm the advantages of the FIC approach over traditional impedance controllers, showcasing its potential for applications in planetary exploration and other scenarios requiring dexterous telemanipulation.

Throughout the history of the lab, subsequent missions have traveled deeper into space, explored more challenging environments, lasted longer, attempted more ambitious science, and returned orders of magnitude more data. This paper is the first in a planned series to document the history of how JPL has commanded its spacecraft in order to achieve the increasingly daring and demanding goals of its missions. This first effort focuses primarily on the onboard technologies associated with JPL's Flight Software (FSW) Core Product Line (FCPL), the Mars rover missions that preceded it, and the Cassini mission to Saturn. It also provides a brief discussion of pre-Cassini missions in order to provide context. Other JPL sequencing technologies (namely VML and the open source F Prime Flight Software) are not discussed in detail here but will instead be the subject of future work, as will any detailed discussions on ground-based software developed to support JPL projects and the interface between onboard autonomy and sequencing. The paper explores the challenges of the more assembly-like sequencing languages common before the mid-1990s (Cassini), the significant paradigm shift that came with the Faster, Better, Cheaper era and Mars Pathfinder (MPF), the development of conditional sequencing for the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER), the SPAM scripting language of Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) and Mars 2020 (M20), the latest developments in the deep space orbiters Psyche and Europa Clipper, and a preliminary look at Sample Retrieval Lander (SRL). VML is also discussed as needed to contextualize the features in JPL's sequencing architecture that were written in response to it. The paper also explores the broader concept of spacecraft behavior. Modern spacecraft behave in highly complex ways and sequencing is only one place where spacecraft designers and operators can encode that complexity. As such, the trades needed to define a sequencing system must take this broader landscape into account. Other important modes of encoding spacecraft behavior include physical hardware, flight software, and real time commanding. Finally, the paper discusses the flexibility JPL's different command and control solutions give to operators to change behaviors in flight. While some sequencing systems are robust enough to resolve complex anomalies or react to unforeseen circumstances in flight, many are not. Historically, JPL's flight system designers have provided many methods to change behavior outside of the normal cadence of design and test, creating a large trade space to do so in flight.","1095-323X","978-1-6654-9032-0","10.1109/AERO55745.2023.10115804","California Institute of Technology; Jet Propulsion Laboratory; National Aeronautics and Space Administration(grant numbers:80NM0018D0004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10115804","","Space vehicles;Sequential analysis;Mars;Satellites;Space missions;Saturn;Aerospace electronics","","3","","49","IEEE","15 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To perform payload grasping, transportation, and release, first, time-optimal reference trajectories are designed through specific waypoints to ensure the fast and reliable execution of the tasks. Then, a two-stage motion control approach is developed based on a robust geometric controller for precise and reliable reference tracking and a linear-quadratic payload regulator for rapid setpoint stabilization of the payload swing.

It is composed of a modified UNet neural network combined with a large-field separable contextual integration (LSCI) module and machine vision techniques for line detection. Such an approach allows the biped robot to accurately detect and locate metal exoskeleton-structure obstacles on glass curtain walls. Moreover, the algorithm adopts point cloud data collected from a depth camera to ensure precise identification of target exoskeleton-structure frames including the positions and tilt angles, facilitating effective real-time collision-free motion planning for the cleaning robot system. Comparative experiments with other neural networks used for image segmentation demonstrate that the proposed LSCI-UNet architecture significantly improves the frame obstacle detection accuracy on exoskeleton-structure glass windows with limited data. The reported method enables the biped cleaning robots to detect obstacles in real-time and effectively navigate on glass walls with exoskeleton-structure beams. Note to Practitioners—Cleaning glass windows of high-altitude buildings imposes significant risks to human workers due to potential falls, which inspires the deployment of window-cleaning robots for such tasks. Bipedal robots exhibit an ability to navigate inclined surfaces of complex exoskeleton structures. Meanwhile, accurate detection and positioning of metal beam obstacles on the windows is crucial for efficient robotic operations in complex environments. However, detecting such obstacles on transparent glass curtain walls remains a considerable challenge. Particularly, the objects behind the glass curtain cause confusion in obstacle detection. To overcome such issue, this paper proposes a new approach of real-time obstacle detection of a biped climbing robot for cleaning glass windows on an exoskeleton-structure building. The effectiveness of the reported methodology has been validated by conducting experimental investigations.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2025.3554653","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52175556); Fundo para o Desenvolvimento das Ciências e da Tecnologia(grant numbers:0004/2022/AKP,0102/2022/A2,0078/2023/RIB3); Universidade de Macau(grant numbers:MYRG-GRG2024-00222-FST-UMDF,MYRGCRG2022-00004-FST-ICI); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10938676","Window-cleaning robot;biped climbing robot;obstacle detection;robotic manipulation;neural networks","Robots;Windows;Glass;Cleaning;Neural networks;Robot kinematics;Image segmentation;Climbing robots;Buildings;Navigation","","2","","27","IEEE","25 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To overcome these shortages, an alternative solution is using heterogeneous robots (fetch and freight robots) cooperatively to accomplish sorting tasks. In this field, the existing works mostly focus on the design of robots, while there is no public literature (to our best knowledge) which studies how to coordinately schedule a large number of fetch and freight robots. To fit this blank, this paper first proposes a cooperative algorithm to schedule hundreds of heterogeneous robots. The algorithm adopts a cloud-edge-terminal architecture, where the cloud is responsible for allocating tasks and robots, the edge computing units monitor the status of each regional area, while the terminals (robots) are able to plan their own paths (guided by the edge computing units) and resolve conflicts by bidding mechanisms.

The simulator contains seven ring-shaped chambers along the J-shape stomach to perform contractions by applying pneumatic actuation. Experiments conducted previously for gastric emptying focused on liquid meals instead of solid meals, which have higher stiffness and require higher break-down forces. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a simulation model of SoGut when it grinds solid food contents that are beads (diameter 1.27 cm) containing agar gel and water at various mixing ratios. The simulation model is based on Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA), with the advantages of finite element method modelling and real-time simulation. First, the relationships between pressure inputs and contraction ratios of the modelling stomach are identified. Next, a series of peristaltic contractions is successfully simulated. An average error at 0.03 of contraction ratio is found, except chamber #5 that has an error at 0.12. Later, beads with different stiffness are placed in the center of chambers and tested to investigate the amount of forces applied to these contents. The stiffness of beads depends on the mixing ratio of agar gel and water, and the motions of beads are constrained on the cross-section plane of the chambers in order to avoid food contents escaping from the contracting regions. The average forces from different chambers applied on the contents in the antrum part of the simulated stomach are less than 0.9 N, which corresponds to the findings in the human stomach reported by literature. Meanwhile, it is also found that the strength of forces generated from the chambers of SoGut depends on the stiffness of the food contents. Additionally, the results of the simulation indicate that when the initial diameters of chambers increase, the provided average forces reduce.","","978-1-6654-3153-8","10.1109/M2VIP49856.2021.9664988","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9664988","Soft robotics;Simulation;Radial contraction actuator;Soft gastric robot","Stomach;Solid modeling;Liquids;Mechatronics;Machine vision;Force;Soft robotics","","2","","24","IEEE","7 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A common solution is to use a layered control architecture, where the top layer uses a simplified model of system dynamics for trajectory generation, and the low layer ensures approximate tracking of this trajectory via feedback control. While such layered control architectures are standard and work well in practice, selecting the simplified model used for trajectory generation typically relies on engineering intuition and experience. In this paper, we propose an alternative data-driven approach to dynamicsaware trajectory generation. We show that a suitable augmented Lagrangian reformulation of a global nonlinear optimal control problem results in a layered decomposition of the overall problem into trajectory planning and feedback control layers. Crucially, the resulting trajectory optimization is dynamicsaware, in that, it is modified with a tracking penalty regularizer encoding the dynamic feasibility of the generated trajectory. We show that this tracking penalty regularizer can be learned from system rollouts for independently-designed low layer feedback control policies, and instantiate our framework in the context of a unicycle and a quadrotor control problem in simulation. Further, we show that our approach handles the sim-to-real gap through experiments on the quadrotor hardware platform without any additional training. For both the synthetic unicycle example and the quadrotor system, our framework shows significant improvements in both computation time and dynamic feasibility in simulation and hardware experiments.","2153-0866","978-1-6654-9190-7","10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10341651","NSF(grant numbers:CPS-2038873,ECCS-2045834,CCR-2112665); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10341651","","Training;Costs;Systematics;Trajectory planning;Computer architecture;Hardware;Trajectory","","2","","35","IEEE","13 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

ESA, JAXA, other space agencies, and commercial entities may contribute additional lunar relay orbiters that are compatible with the NASA’s orbiters via the LunaNet Interoperability Specifications.To ensure sustained human presence at the Moon, NASA plans to deploy surface infrastructure elements that can survive the lunar nights. We are investigating the operation concept and PNT performance of augmenting the lunar relay network with a surface station with the following capabilities: 1. Provide short-range time distribution to orbiting and surface spacecraft. 2. Transmit a GNSS-like signal to augment the orbital determination (OD) schemes of lunar spacecraft for fast OD convergence. The transmitter can also act as a surface beacon that guides the lunar spacecraft during dynamic events like decent and ascent. 3. Receive lunar relay orbiter’s and Earth’s GPS signals and estimate corrections for orbiting spacecraft. This enables improved OD performance and accurate relative navigation of users on the lunar surface. The Joint Doppler Ranging (JDR) method requires as few as one orbiter to perform a real-time position fix of a surface user.

For complex robots, IK methods are often based on root search and nonlinear optimization algorithms. These algorithms can be massively sped up using a neural network to predict a good initial guess, which can then be refined in a few numerical iterations. Besides previous work on learning-based IK, we present a learning approach for the fundamentally more complex problem of IK with collision avoidance. We do this in diverse and previously unseen environments. From a detailed analysis of the IK learning problem, we derive a network and unsupervised learning architecture that removes the need for a sample data generation step. Using the trained network's prediction as an initial guess for a two-stage Jacobian-based solver allows for fast and accurate computation of the collision-free IK. For the humanoid robot, Agile Justin (19 DoF), the collision-free IK is solved in less than 10 ms (on a single CPU core) and with an accuracy of $1 \times 10^{-4}\mathrm{m}$ and $1\times 10^{-3}$ rad based on a high-resolution world model generated from the robot's integrated 3D sensor. Our method massively outperforms a random multi-start baseline in a benchmark with the 19 DoF humanoid and challenging 3D environments. It requires ten times less training time than a supervised training method while achieving comparable results.","2164-0580","979-8-3503-0327-8","10.1109/Humanoids57100.2023.10375143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10375143","","Training;Robot motion;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Humanoid robots;Kinematics;Robot sensing systems","","2","","29","IEEE","1 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, increased computational power in the industrial field allows the implementation of advanced control algorithms such as nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), which is an optimal control scheme that includes system and control constraints imposed by robot dynamics and the environment. Nevertheless, modeling the robot and its environment is a complicated task due to high nonlinearities, such as model uncertainties in the form of complex unmodeled dynamics, varying payloads, and parameter mismatch, leading to fast degradation of NMPC; therefore, online adaptation laws that improve the performance even in unknown environments are needed. Due to the facts presented before, this work combines the universal approximation of RBFNN and the optimality offered by NMPC in a unified adaptive framework that guarantees good performance even under uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics. The proposed framework is tested in simulation using a 2-link planar robotic arm (SCARA Bosch SR-800), where optimization techniques were used to identify the robot's dynamics. Finally, a comparison of the proposed architecture with a baseline nominal NMPC is made with particular attention to trajectory tracking performance, demonstrating the reduction of the tracking error over non-adaptive NMPC.","2576-3555","979-8-3503-1140-2","10.1109/CoDIT58514.2023.10284283","Universidad de las Fuerzas; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10284283","","Adaptation models;Uncertainty;Trajectory tracking;System dynamics;Service robots;Heuristic algorithms;Prediction algorithms","","2","","29","IEEE","24 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article presents a fast real-time instance segmentation network (FRISNET) by fusing the information from the frequency domain and space domain. Based on you only look at coefficients (YOLACT), which is the fastest instance segmentation method, the frequency domain representation is introduced into a convolutional neural network (CNN). By fast Fourier transform (FFT), features of different frequencies extracted from the frequency domain are fused with the characteristic map of the spatial domain. Accurate global location information and clear semantic information are obtained using CNN. To take advantage of the high-resolution information of target location and feature information from the bottom level, as well as the supervision information located at the entirely identical level, a brand fresh bottom-up feature fusion branch and skip connection at the same level are introduced based on the top-down feature pyramid network (FPN) feature fusion network, enabling the feature extraction network to possess diverse feature representation. The proposed instance segmentation model is trained on open standard datasets of PASCAL segmentation boundary detection (PASCAL SBD) and Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO). The results show that the proposed method improves instance segmentation accuracy. It achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 34.5 at 31.77 frames/s (FPS) on MS COCO.

Model-based offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a feasible solution. On the one hand, it eliminates the requirements of interaction with the actual environment. On the other hand, it learns the transition dynamics and reward function from the offline datasets and generates simulated rollouts to accelerate training. Previous model-based offline RL methods adopt probabilistic ensemble neural networks (NN) to model aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. However, this results in a great increase in training time and computing resource requirements. Furthermore, these methods are easily disturbed by the accumulative errors of the environment dynamics models when simulating long-term rollouts. To solve the above problems, we propose an uncertainty-aware sequence modeling architecture called Environment Transformer. It models the probability distribution of the environment dynamics and reward function to capture aleatoric uncertainty and treats epistemic uncertainty as a learnable noise parameter. Benefiting from the accurate modeling of the transition dynamics and reward function, Environment Transformer can be combined with arbitrary planning, dynamics programming, or policy optimization algorithms for offline RL. In this case, we perform Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) to learn a conservative Q-function. Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves or exceeds state-of-the-art performance in widely studied offline RL benchmarks. Moreover, we show that Environment Transformer's simulated rollout quality, sample efficiency, and long-term rollout simulation capability are superior to those of previous model-based offline RL methods.","2153-0866","979-8-3503-7770-5","10.1109/IROS58592.2024.10802094","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10802094","","Training;Uncertainty;Q-learning;Computational modeling;Transformers;Probabilistic logic;Probability distribution;Dynamic programming;Planning;Optimization","","","","40","IEEE","25 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these challenges, we introduce a novel VLM-Assisted Siamese Flow Diffusion (VLM-SFD) framework for efficient imitation learning in dual-arm cooperative manipulation. The proposed VLM-SFD framework exhibits outstanding adaptability, significantly enhancing the ability to rapidly adapt and generalize to diverse real-world tasks from only a minimal number of human demonstrations. Specifically, we propose a Siamese Flow Diffusion Network (SFDNet) employs a dual-encoder-decoder Siamese architecture to embed two target objects into a shared latent space, while a diffusion-based conditioning process—conditioned by task instructions—generates two-stream object-centric motion flows that guide dual-arm coordination. We further design a dynamic task assignment strategy that seamlessly maps the predicted 2D motion flows into 3D space and incorporates a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to adaptively assign the optimal motion to each robotic arm over time.

This is the third time that the HRI research community cannot meet in person, because of the COVID-19 pandemic; originally, we planned and hoped for at least a hybrid conference to be hosted in Sapporo, to finally bring back the conference to Japan. Our theme “Breaking Boundaries,” reflected this notion of breaking the boundaries between virtual and real-world spaces. However, there are more boundaries our community wants to break: between robotic technology and people - in order to create safe, meaningful, and wanted human-robot interactions for people and society, between scientific disciplines, communities, and backgrounds - in order to create new ways of thinking about our future lives with robotic technology. The HRI Conference is the premium venue for publishing and presenting top-quality HRI research and the virtual format might even allow us to attract and include more people who would not have the opportunity to travel to Japan.","","978-1-6654-0731-1","10.1109/HRI53351.2022.9889514","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9889514","","","","","","","IEEE","29 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
