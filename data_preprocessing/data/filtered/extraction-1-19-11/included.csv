10.1002/cav.70032,Computer Animation and Virtual Worlds,"This article presents the architecture of MemorIA, an integrative system that combines existing AI technologies into a coherent educational framework for creating interactive historical agents, with the aim of fostering students' learning interest. MemorIA generates animated digital portraits of historical figures, synchronizing facial expressions with synthesized speech to enable natural conversations with students. The system leverages NVIDIA Audio2Face for real-time facial animation with first-order motion model for portrait manipulation, achieving fluid interaction through low-latency audio-visual streaming. To assess our architecture in a field situation, we conducted a pilot study in middle school history classes, where students and teachers engaged in direct conversation with a virtual Julius Caesar during Roman history lessons. Students asked questions about ancient Rome, receiving contextually appropriate responses. While qualitative feedback suggests a positive trend toward increased student participation, some weaknesses and ethical considerations emerged. Based on this assessment, we discuss implementation challenges, suggest architectural improvements, and explore potential applications across various disciplines. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1002/int.22550,International Journal of Intelligent Systems,"This paper presents a grammar-based evolutionary approach that incorporates abstractions to learn complex collective behaviours through their simpler representations. We propose modifications to the grammar syntax design and genome structure to facilitate evolution of abstractions in separate genome partitions. Two abstraction techniques based on behavioural decomposition and environmental scaffolding are presented to derive these simpler representations. Parallel and incremental learning architectures incorporated with grammatical evolution (GE) are investigated with three complex problems to evaluate their potential in generating collective multi-agent behaviours. The results infer that both learning architectures surpass a generic GE model in performance for evolving complex behaviours. Furthermore, using environmental scaffolding reduces the robustness of the model than when only the behavioural decomposition technique is used. However, it has more potential to generate solutions with better fitness than when scaffoldings are not used. The evaluations suggest that, by incorporating abstraction learning architectures with grammar-based evolution can significantly improve the performance of an agent system in complex problem domains. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1002/spe.2345,Software - Practice and Experience,"The increasing demand of computational and storage resources is shifting users toward the adoption of cloud technologies. Cloud computing is based on the vision of computing as utility, where users no more need to buy machines but simply access remote resources made available on-demand by cloud providers. The relationship between users and providers is defined by a service-level agreement, where the non-fulfillment of its terms is regulated by the associated penalty fees. Therefore, it is important that the providers adopt proper monitoring and managing strategies. Despite their reduced application, intelligent agents constitute a feasible technology to add autonomic features to cloud operations. Furthermore, the volunteer computing paradigm - one of the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) trends of the last decade - can be pulled alongside traditional cloud approaches, with the purpose to 'green' them. Indeed, the combination of data center and volunteer resources, managed by agents, allows one to obtain a more robust and scalable cloud computing platform. The increased challenges in designing such a complex system can benefit from a simulation-based approach, to test autonomic management solutions before their deployment in the production environment. However, currently available simulators of cloud platforms are not suitable to model and analyze such heterogeneous, large-scale, and highly dynamic systems. We propose the AVOCLOUDY simulator to fill this gap. This paper presents the internal architecture of the simulator, provides implementation details, summarizes several notable applications, and provides experimental results that measure the simulator performance and its accuracy. The latter experiments are based on real-world worldwide distributed computations on top of the PlanetLab platform. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1002/spe.2778,Software - Practice and Experience,"One desired aspect of microservice architecture is the ability to self-adapt its own architecture and behavior in response to changes in the operational environment. To achieve the desired high levels of self-adaptability, this research implements distributed microservice architecture model running a swarm cluster, as informed by the Monitor, Analyze, Plan, and Execute over a shared Knowledge (MAPE-K) model. The proposed architecture employs multiadaptation agents supported by a centralized controller, which can observe the environment and execute a suitable adaptation action. The adaptation planning is managed by a deep recurrent Q-learning network (DRQN). It is argued that such integration between DRQN and Markov decision process (MDP) agents in a MAPE-K model offers distributed microservice architecture with self-adaptability and high levels of availability and scalability. Integrating DRQN into the adaptation process improves the effectiveness of the adaptation and reduces any adaptation risks, including resource overprovisioning and thrashing. The performance of DRQN is evaluated against deep Q-learning and policy gradient algorithms, including (1) a deep Q-learning network (DQN), (2) a dueling DQN (DDQN), (3) a policy gradient neural network, and (4) deep deterministic policy gradient. The DRQN implementation in this paper manages to outperform the aforementioned algorithms in terms of total reward, less adaptation time, lower error rates, plus faster convergence and training time. We strongly believe that DRQN is more suitable for driving the adaptation in distributed services-oriented architecture and offers better performance than other dynamic decision-making algorithms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

The raw visual information is processed at different stages to generate hybrid symbolic/sub-symbolic descriptions of the scene, agents and events. The background is incrementally learned at the lowest layer, which is used further in the mid-level for multi-agent tracking with symbolic reasoning. The agent/event discovery is performed at the next higher layer by processing the agent features, status history and trajectory.

Automated reasoning mechanisms for requirements and software verification are by now a well-accepted part of the design process, and model driven architectures support the automation of the refinement process. We claim that we can further push the envelope towards the automatic exploration and selection among design alternatives and show that this is concretely possible for Secure Tropos, a requirements engineering methodology that addresses security and trust concerns. In Secure Tropos, a design consists of a network of actors (agents, positions or roles) with delegation/permission dependencies among them. Accordingly, the generation of design alternatives can be accomplished by a planner which is given as input a set of actors and goals and generates alternative multiagent plans to fulfill all given goals.

10.1007/11881216_34,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,"This paper presents an architecture that makes it possible to construct dynamic systems capable of growing in dimension and adapting its knowledge to environmental changes. An architecture must define the components of the system (agents in this case), as well as the way in which those components communicate and interact with each other in order to achieve the system's goals. The work presented here focuses on the development of an agent-based architecture, based on the use of deliberative agents, that incorporate case based reasoning. The proposed architecture requires an analysis and design methodology that facilitates the building of distributed systems using this technology. The proposal combines elements of existing methodologies such as Gaia and AUML in order to take advantage of their characteristics. Moreover the architecture takes into account the possibility of modelling problems in dynamic environments and therefore the use of autonomous models that evolve over time. To solve this problem the architecture incorporates CBR-agents whose aim is to acquire knowledge and adapt themselves to environmental changes. The architecture has been applied to model for evaluating the interaction between the atmosphere and the ocean, as well as for the planification and optimization of sea routes for vessels.

The former has been proven to have a great influence on the outcomes of simulations as they modify the behaviour of agents to make them escape in groups. This phenomenon strongly affects the efficiency of the evacuation. The latter impacts the ways the people will try to escape, leading to adaptation and unplanned behaviour. This paper presents an evacuation model that includes cognition with a BDI architecture to represent the way agents do complex reasoning, social relationships and a modelling of fear.

10.1007/978-3-030-12988-0_2,Communications in Computer and Information Science,"The spread of autonomous systems into safety-critical areas has increased the demand for their formal verification, not only due to stronger certification requirements but also to public uncertainty over these new technologies. However, the complex nature of such systems, for example, the intricate combination of discrete and continuous aspects, ensures that whole system verification is often infeasible. This motivates the need for novel analysis approaches that modularise the problem, allowing us to restrict our analysis to one particular aspect of the system while abstracting away from others. For instance, while verifying the real-time properties of an autonomous system we might hide the details of the internal decision-making components. In this paper we describe verification of a range of properties across distinct dimensions on a practical hybrid agent architecture. This allows us to verify the autonomous decision-making, real-time aspects, and spatial aspects of an autonomous vehicle platooning system.

Manual annotation of landmarks is a tedious process that requires domain-specific expertise and introduces inter-observer variability. This paper proposes a new detection approach for multiple landmarks based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our hypothesis is that the position of all anatomical landmarks is interdependent and non-random within the human anatomy, thus finding one landmark can help to deduce the location of others. Using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) architecture we construct an environment and agent with implicit inter-communication such that we can accommodate K agents acting and learning simultaneously, while they attempt to detect K different landmarks. During training the agents collaborate by sharing their accumulated knowledge for a collective gain. We compare our approach with state-of-the-art architectures and achieve significantly better accuracy by reducing the detection error by 50%, while requiring fewer computational resources and time to train compared to the naïve approach of training K agents separately.

10.1007/978-3-030-33792-6_19,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,"Computational agents based upon the belief-desire-intention (BDI) architecture generally use reactive rules to trigger the execution of plans. For various reasons, certain plans might be preferred over others at design time. Most BDI agents platforms use hard-coding these preferences in some form of the static ordering of the reactive rules, but keeping the preferential structure implicit limits script reuse and generalization. This paper proposes an approach to add qualitative preferences over adoption/avoidance of procedural goals into an agent script, building upon the well-known notation of conditional ceteris paribus preference networks (CP-nets). For effective execution, the procedural knowledge and the preferential structure of the agent are mapped in an off-line fashion into a new reactive agent script. This solution contrasts with recent proposals integrating preferences as a rationale in the decision making cycle, and so overriding the reactive nature of BDI agents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1007/978-3-030-35664-4_3,Communications in Computer and Information Science,"A long-standing challenge in Reinforcement Learning is enabling agents to learn a model of their environment which can be transferred to solve other problems in a world with the same underlying rules. One reason this is difficult is the challenge of learning accurate models of an environment. If such a model is inaccurate, the agent’s plans and actions will likely be sub-optimal, and likely lead to the wrong outcomes. Recent progress in model-based reinforcement learning has improved the ability for agents to learn and use predictive models. In this paper, we extend a recent deep learning architecture which learns a predictive model of the environment that aims to predict only the value of a few key measurements, which are indicative of an agent’s performance. Predicting only a few measurements rather than the entire future state of an environment makes it more feasible to learn a valuable predictive model. We extend this predictive model with a small, evolving neural network that suggests the best goals to pursue in the current state. We demonstrate that this allows the predictive model to transfer to new scenarios where goals are different, and that the adaptive goals can even adjust agent behavior on-line, changing its strategy to fit the current context. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

But REST does not make it possible to inject artificial intelligence into connected objects, i.e. it cannot allow autonomy and decision-making by the objects themselves. To define an intelligence to a connected object, one can use a Believe Desire Intention agent (BDI an intelligent agent that adopts human behavior) such as Jason Agentspeak. But Jason AgentSpeak does not guarantee orchestration or choreography between connected objects. There are platforms for service orchestration and choreography in IoT, still the interconnection with artificial intelligence needs to be built. In this article, we propose a new approach called Jason-RS. It is a result of pairing Jason BDI agent with the web service technologies to exploit the agent capacity as a service, Jason-RS turn in Java SE and it does not need any middleware. The architecture that we propose allows to create the link between Artificial Intelligence and Services choreography to reduce human intervention in the service choreography. In order to validate the proposed approach, we have interconnected the Iot BeC3 platform and the REST agent (Jason-RS). The decision-making faculty offered by Jason-RS is derived from the information sent by the objects according to the different methods of REST (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) that Jason-RS offers. As a result, the objects feed the inter-agent collaborations and decision-making inside the agent. Finally, we show that Jason-RS allows the Web of Objects to power complex systems such as an artificial intelligence responsible for processing data.

The integration of deep learning and logic reasoning is still an open-research problem and it is considered to be the key for the development of real intelligent agents. This paper presents Deep Logic Models, which are deep graphical models integrating deep learning and logic reasoning both for learning and inference. Deep Logic Models create an end-to-end differentiable architecture, where deep learners are embedded into a network implementing a continuous relaxation of the logic knowledge. The learning process allows to jointly learn the weights of the deep learners and the meta-parameters controlling the high-level reasoning.

CPS are increasingly required to act and interact with one another in dynamic environments. In the last decades, the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) architecture has proven to be ideal for developing agents with flexible behavior.

This paper proposes a revision of the BDI model by integrating real-time mechanisms into the reasoning cycle of the agent. By doing so, the BDI agent can make decisions and execute plans ensuring compliance with strict timing constraints also in dynamic environments, where unpredictable events may occur. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

In this type of system, autonomous agents can aid in the decision making and high-level control of the robot. For example, a robot may have a module for each of the effectors and sensors that it has and an agent with a plan library containing high-level plans to aid in the decision making within these modules. However, when autonomously replacing a node it can be difficult to reconfigure plans in the agent’s plan library while retaining correctness.

Additionally, it is necessary to understand the behaviour of an autonomous vehicle in order to check whether or not it works according to the rules of the road. Here, we propose an agent-based architecture to embed the rules of the road into an agent representing the behaviour of an autonomous vehicle. We use temporal logic to formally represent the rules of the road in a way it should be possible to capture when and how a given rule of the road can be applied.

These systems can suffer from population bloat and so are amenable to compaction techniques that try to strike a balance between population size and performance. A well-studied LCS architecture is XCSF, which in the RL setting acts as a Q-function approximator. We apply XCSF to a deterministic and stochastic variant of the FrozenLake8x8 environment from OpenAI Gym, with its performance compared in terms of function approximation error and policy accuracy to the optimal Q-functions and policies produced by solving the environments via dynamic programming. We then introduce a novel compaction algorithm (Greedy Niche Mass Compaction—GNMC) and study its operation on XCSF’s trained populations. Results show that given a suitable parametrisation, GNMC preserves or even slightly improves function approximation error while yielding a significant reduction in population size. Reasonable preservation of policy accuracy also occurs, and we link this metric to the commonly used steps-to-goal metric in maze-like environments, illustrating how the metrics are complementary rather than competitive. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

10.1007/978-3-030-66412-1_1,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,"The architecture described in this paper encodes a theory of intentions based on the principles of non-procrastination, persistence, and relevance. The architecture reasons with transition diagrams at two different resolutions, with the fine-resolution description defined as a refinement of, and hence tightly-coupled with, a coarse-resolution description. For any given goal, non-monotonic logical reasoning with the coarse-resolution description computes an activity, i.e., a plan, comprising a sequence of abstract actions to be executed to achieve the goal. Each abstract action is implemented as a sequence of concrete actions by automatically zooming to and reasoning with the part of the fine-resolution transition diagram relevant to the coarse-resolution transition and the goal. Each concrete action is executed using probabilistic models of the uncertainty in sensing and actuation, and the corresponding coarse-resolution observations are added to the coarse-resolution history. Experimental results in the context of simulated and physical robots indicate improvements in reliability and efficiency compared with an architecture that does not include the theory of intentions, and an architecture that does not include zooming for fine-resolution reasoning. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Priority between plans is hard-coded in the program, and so the reasons why a certain plan is preferred remain in the programmer’s mind. Recent works that attempt to include explicit preferences in BDI agents treat preferences essentially as a rationale for planning tasks to be performed at run-time, thus disrupting the reactive nature of agents. In this paper we propose a method to include declarative preferences (i.e. concerning states of affairs) in the agent program, and to use them in a manner that preserves reactivity. To achieve this, the plan prioritization step is performed offline, by (a) generating all possible outcomes of situated plan executions, (b) selecting a relevant subset of situation/outcomes couplings as representative summary for each plan, (c) sorting the plans by evaluating summaries through the agent’s preferences. The task of generating outcomes in several conditions is performed by translating the agent’s procedural knowledge to an ASP program using discrete-event calculus. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

However, existing reinforcement learning techniques are incapable of explicitly incorporating already known domain-specific knowledge into the learning process. Therefore, the agents have to explore and learn the domain knowledge independently through a trial and error approach, which consumes both time and resources to make valid responses. Hence, we adapt the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to incorporate an adviser, which allows integrating domain knowledge in the form of pre-learned policies or pre-defined relationships to enhance the agent’s learning process.

As modern-day fleets are well equipped with wireless sensing, processing, and communication devices, fleet operators could proactively respond to dynamic events. However, the use of real-time sensor data to achieve re-optimization is scarce. This observation raises the question of how logistics operators should incorporate the emerging track-and-trace services into their dynamic planning activities. In this paper, we propose a reference architecture that relies on both the Internet of Things and the Smart Logistics paradigms, and aims at enhancing the resilience of logistics networks. Since the decision of when to reschedule the network’s configurations remains nontrivial, we propose a hierarchical set of disruption handling systems to facilitate the trade-off between decision quality and response time. In our design, autonomous logistics agents can quickly anticipate on minor changes in their surroundings, while more severe disruptions require both more data and computational power in higher-level processing nodes (e.g., fog/cloud computing, machine learning, optimization algorithms). We illustrate the need of our architecture in the context of the dynamic vehicle routing problem. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

In these courses, the intervention of tutors and teachers is essential to support students in the teaching-learning process, answer questions about their content, and provide engagement for students. However, as these courses have a vast and diverse audience, tutors and teachers find it difficult to monitor them closely and efficiently with prompt interventions. This work proposes an architecture to favor the construction of knowledge for students, tutors, and teachers through autonomous interference and recommendations of educational resources. The architecture is based on a conversational agent and an educational recommendation system. For the training of predictive models and extraction of semantic information, ontology and logical rules were used, together with inference algorithms and machine learning techniques, which act on a dataset with messages exchanged between course forum participants in the humanities, medicine, and education fields. The messages are classified according to the type (question, answer, and opinion) and parameters about feeling, confusion, and urgency. The architecture can infer the moment in which a student needs help and, through a Conversational Recommendation System, provides the student with the opportunity to revise his or her knowledge on the subject. To help in this task, the architecture can provide educational resources via an autonomous agent, contributing to reducing the degree of confusion and urgency identified in the posts. Initial results indicate that integrating technologies and resources, complementing each other, can support the students and help them succeed in their educational training. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

This is why we propose a model allowing a user to configure the level of the agent’s decision-making autonomy according to their requirements. Our model, based on a BDI architecture, combines control constraints given by the user, an internal model simulating human daily needs for autonomy, and a scheduling process to create an activity plan considering these two parts. Using a calendar, the activities that must be performed in the required time can be given by the user. In addition, the user can indicate whether interruptions can happen during the activity calendar to apply an effect induced by the internal model. The plan generated by our model can be executed in the VE by an animated agent in real-time.

In this paper, we discuss and evaluate a novel type of CTS that leverages recent advances in large language models (LLMs) in two ways: First, the system enables AI-assisted content authoring by inducing an easily editable tutoring script automatically from a lesson text. Second, the system automates the script orchestration in a learning-by-teaching format via two LLM-based agents (Ruffle &Riley) acting as a student and a professor.

There exist several convergent and consistent RL algorithms which have been intensively studied. In their original form, these algorithms require that the environment states and agent actions take values in a relatively small discrete set. Fuzzy representations for approximate, model-free RL have been proposed in the literature for the more difficult case where the state-action space is continuous. In this work, we propose a fuzzy approximation architecture similar to those previously used for Q-learning, but we combine it with the model-based Q-value iteration algorithm. We prove that the resulting algorithm converges. We also give a modified, asynchronous variant of the algorithm that converges at least as fast as the original version.

In this paper we take this idea one step further and develop the concept of a fully integrated argumentation-based agent architecture. Under this architecture, an agent is composed of a collection of modules each of which is responsible for a basic capability or reasoning task of the agent. A local argumentation theory in the module gives preferred decision choices for the module's task in a way that is sensitive to the way the agent is currently situated in its external environment. The inter-module coordination or intra-agent control also relies on a local argumentation theory in each module that defines an internal communication policy between the modules. The paper lays the foundations of this approach, presents an abstract agent architecture and gives the general underlying argumentation machinery minimally required for building such agents, including the important aspects of inter-module coordination via argumentation. It presents the basic properties that we can expect from these agents and illustrates the possibility of this type of agent design with its advantages of high-level of flexibility and expressiveness. © 2012 Springer-Verlag. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

I discuss several technical papers that outline novel architectures in machine learning and how they conceive of the “world”. The agency to learn and the learning curriculum are modulated through worlding (in the sense of setting up and unfolding of the world for artificial agents) in machine learning engineering. In recent computer science articles, large models trained on Internet-scale datasets are framed as general world simulators—despite their partiality, historicity, finite nature, and cultural specificity. I introduce the notion of “model worlds” to refer to composable interactive environments designed for the purpose of machine learning that partake in legitimising that claim. I discuss how large models are grounded through interaction in model worlds, arguing that model worlds mediate between the sheer scale of language models and their hypothetical capacity to generalise to new tasks and domains, rehashing the empiricist logic of “big data”. Further, I show that the emerging capacity of artificial agents to generalise redraws the epistemic boundary between artificial agents and their learning environments. Consequently, superficial statistics of language models and abstract action are made meaningful in distilled model worlds, giving rise to synthetic agency. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1007/s00170-021-07028-z,International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,"This paper presents the design of a multi-agent framework that aids engineers in the adaptation of modular production systems. The framework includes general implementations of agents and other software components for self-learning and adaptation, sensor data analysis, system modelling and simulation, as well as human-computer interaction. During an adaptation process, operators make changes to the production system, in order to increase capacity or manufacture a product variant. These changes are automatically captured and evaluated by the framework, building an experience base of adjustments that is then used to infer adaptation knowledge. The architecture of the framework consists of agents divided in two layers: the agents in the lower layer are associated with individual production modules, whereas the agents in the higher layer are associated with the entire production line. Modelling, learning, and adaptations can be performed at both levels, using a semantic model to specify the structure and capabilities of the production system. An evaluation of a prototype implementation has been conducted on an industrial assembly system. The results indicate that the use of the framework in a typical adaptation process provides a significant reduction in time and resources required. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1007/s00422-009-0342-5,Biological Cybernetics,"In this study, based on behavioral and neurophysiological facts, a new hierarchical multi-agent architecture is proposed to model the human motor control system. Performance of the proposed structure is investigated by simulating the control of sit to stand movement. To develop the model, concepts of mixture of experts, modular structure, and some aspects of equilibrium point hypothesis were brought together. We have called this architecture MODularized Experts Model (MODEM). Human motor system is modeled at the joint torque level and the role of the muscles has been embedded in the function of the joint compliance characteristics. The input to the motor system, i.e., the central command, is the reciprocal command. At the lower level, there are several experts to generate the central command to control the task according to the details of the movement. The number of experts depends on the task to be performed. At the higher level, a ""gate selector"" block selects the suitable subordinate expert considering the context of the task. Each expert consists of a main controller and a predictor as well as several auxiliary modules. The main controller of an expert learns to control the performance of a given task by generating appropriate central commands under given conditions and/or constraints. The auxiliary modules of this expert learn to scrutinize the generated central command by the main controller. Auxiliary modules increase their intervention to correct the central command if the movement error is increased due to an external disturbance. Each auxiliary module acts autonomously and can be interpreted as an agent. Each agent is responsible for one joint and, therefore, the number of the agents of each expert is equal to the number of joints. Our results indicate that this architecture is robust against external disturbances, signal-dependent noise in sensory information, and changes in the environment. We also discuss the neurophysiological and behavioral basis of the proposed model (MODEM). © 2009 Springer-Verlag. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

As these models are often extremely large, however, their use for applications within embedded devices may not be feasible. In this work, we look at one such specific application, retrieval-based dialogue systems, that poses additional difficulties when deployed in environments characterized by limited resources. Research on building dialogue systems able to engage in natural sounding conversation with humans has attracted increasing attention in recent years. This has led to the rise of commercial conversational agents, such as Google Home, Alexa and Siri situated on embedded devices, that enable users to interface with a wide range of underlying functionalities in a natural and seamless manner. In part due to memory and computational power constraints, these agents necessitate frequent communication with a server in order to process the users’ queries. This communication may act as a bottleneck, resulting in delays as well as in the halt of the system should the network connection be lost or unavailable. We propose a new framework for hardware-aware retrieval-based dialogue systems based on the Dual-Encoder architecture, coupled with a clustering method to group candidates pertaining to a same conversation, that reduces storage capacity and computational power requirements. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1007/s00521-022-07691-7,Neural Computing and Applications,"Due to its perceptual limitations, an agent may have too little information about the environment to act optimally. In such cases, it is important to keep track of the action-observation history to uncover hidden state information. Recent deep reinforcement learning methods use recurrent neural networks (RNN) to memorize past observations. However, these models are expensive to train and have convergence difficulties, especially when dealing with high dimensional data. In this paper, we propose influence-aware memory, a theoretically inspired memory architecture that alleviates the training difficulties by restricting the input of the recurrent layers to those variables that influence the hidden state information. Moreover, as opposed to standard RNNs, in which every piece of information used for estimating Q values is inevitably fed back into the network for the next prediction, our model allows information to flow without being necessarily stored in the RNN’s internal memory. Results indicate that, by letting the recurrent layers focus on a small fraction of the observation variables while processing the rest of the information with a feedforward neural network, we can outperform standard recurrent architectures both in training speed and policy performance. This approach also reduces runtime and obtains better scores than methods that stack multiple observations to remove partial observability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

We consider both the NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-301 settings, and compare against various known strong baselines, such as local search and random search. While achieving competitive performance on both benchmarks, the amount of training required for the much larger NAS-Bench-301 is only marginally greater than NAS-Bench-101, illustrating the strong scaling properties of our agent. Our agent is able to achieve strong performance, but the choice of values for certain parameters are crucial to ensuring the succesful training of the agent.

10.1007/s00521-025-11272-9,Neural Computing and Applications,"In multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL), agents can learn to communicate to broaden their view and understanding of the environment and their teammates. Previous works on communication in MADRL mainly rely on centralized or independent value functions for learning communication, which cannot differentiate how communicating agents individually contribute to the overall learning process. Moreover, continuous environments that incorporate continuous state/action spaces have received limited attention in previous research. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for communicating agents and apply centralized but factorized value functions to differentiate how each agent contributes to learning during communication, along with gradient backpropagation. Additionally, to address the complexity introduced by communication, we investigate the use of an attention mechanism that aggregates messages, enabling policies to maintain a fixed input length. We then present a new policy gradient method termed communication with factorized policy gradients (CFPG), featuring full backpropagation from factorized value functions to communicating agents’ architecture. We demonstrate that CFPG can enhance performance and accelerate learning in continuous predator–prey scenarios and multi-agent MuJoCo, when compared to other learning communication methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Furthermore, with the recent development of large-scale artificial intelligence models, we should soon be able to incorporate tacit human knowledge into this architecture. However, there is not yet a method for adjusting the parameters in this architecture which creates a barrier to future extension. In response, we have developed a method for automatically adjusting the parameters using evolutionary computation.

A contrary point of view argues that machine learning has limitations, and, taken in isolation, cannot form the basis of autonomous systems capable of intelligent behaviour in complex environments. In this paper, we explore the contributions that agent-oriented programming can make to the development of future intelligent systems. We briefly review the state of the art in agent programming, focussing particularly on BDI-based agent programming languages, and discuss previous work on integrating AI techniques (including machine learning) in agent-oriented programming. We argue that the unique strengths of BDI agent languages provide an ideal framework for integrating the wide range of AI capabilities necessary for progress towards the next-generation of intelligent systems. We identify a range of possible approaches to integrating AI into a BDI agent architecture. Some of these approaches, e.g., ‘AI as a service’, exploit immediate synergies between rapidly maturing AI techniques and agent programming, while others, e.g., ‘AI embedded into agents’ raise more fundamental research questions, and we sketch a programme of research directed towards identifying the most appropriate ways of integrating AI capabilities into agent programs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Previous research efforts have explored the capabilities of MARL algorithms within Hanabi, focusing largely on advanced architecture design and algorithmic manipulations to achieve state-of-the-art performance for various number of cooperators. However, this often leads to complex solution strategies with high computational cost and requiring large amounts of training data. For humans to solve the Hanabi game effectively, they require the use of conventions, which often allows for a means to implicitly convey ideas or knowledge based on a predefined, and mutually agreed upon, set of “rules” or principles. Multi-agent problems containing partial observability, especially when limited communication is present, can benefit greatly from the use of implicit knowledge sharing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to augmenting an agent’s action space using conventions, which act as a sequence of special cooperative actions that span over and include multiple time steps and multiple agents, requiring agents to actively opt in for it to reach fruition. These conventions are based on existing human conventions, and result in a significant improvement on the performance of existing techniques for self-play and cross-play for various number of cooperators within Hanabi. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

More importantly, there has been a renewed focus on RL since the introduction of deep learning that essentially makes RL feasible to operate in high-dimensional environments. However, there are many diversified research directions in the current literature, such as multi-agent and multi-objective learning, and human-machine interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive software architecture that not only plays a vital role in designing a connect-the-dots deep RL architecture but also provides a guideline to develop a realistic RL application in a short time span. By inheriting the proposed architecture, software managers can foresee any challenges when designing a deep RL-based system. As a result, they can expedite the design process and actively control every stage of software development, which is especially critical in agile development environments. For this reason, we design a deep RL-based framework that strictly ensures flexibility, robustness, and scalability. To enforce generalization, the proposed architecture also does not depend on a specific RL algorithm, a network configuration, the number of agents, or the type of agents. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1007/s10514-020-09960-7,Autonomous Robots,"One of the challenging aspects of open ended or lifelong agent development is that the final behaviour for which an agent is trained at a given moment can be an element for the future creation of one, or even several, behaviours of greater complexity, whose purpose cannot be anticipated. In this paper, we present modular influence network design (MIND), an artificial agent control architecture suited to open ended and cumulative learning. The MIND architecture encapsulates sub behaviours into modules and combines them into a hierarchy reflecting the modular and hierarchical nature of complex tasks. Compared to similar research, the main original aspect of MIND is the multi layered hierarchy using a generic control signal, the influence, to obtain an efficient global behaviour. This article shows the ability of MIND to learn a curriculum of independent didactic tasks of increasing complexity covering different aspects of a desired behaviour. In so doing we demonstrate the contributions of MIND to open-ended development: encapsulation into modules allows for the preservation and re-usability of all the skills acquired during the curriculum and their focused retraining, the modular structure serves the evolving topology by easing the coordination of new sensors, actuators and heterogeneous learning structures. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1007/s10515-014-0168-9,Automated Software Engineering,"We present a verification methodology for analysing the decision-making component in agent-based hybrid systems. Traditionally hybrid automata have been used to both implement and verify such systems, but hybrid automata based modelling, programming and verification techniques scale poorly as the complexity of discrete decision-making increases making them unattractive in situations where complex logical reasoning is required. In the programming of complex systems it has, therefore, become common to separate out logical decision-making into a separate, discrete, component. However, verification techniques have failed to keep pace with this development. We are exploring agent-based logical components and have developed a model checking technique for such components which can then be composed with a separate analysis of the continuous part of the hybrid system.

The present study describes a preliminary simulation of social influence and conformity using three possible cognitive mechanisms: the first is a homophily-based model that weighs belief updating based on generating a latent trust magnitude relying entirely on strategy selection, and the second two are novel similarity-learning and structure-mapping mechanisms embodied in the ACT-R cognitive architecture (Anderson 1990) that spread association via learned similarities based on communicating similar beliefs from other agents. Across three simulations (homophily, similarity, similarity+structure mapping), the homophily model was the only model capable of capturing both influence and conformity effects. The similarity model quickly flipped based on the statistics of the messages (i.e., more opposing messages than supporting messages) while the similarity+structure mapping eventually led to a convergence and averaging across beliefs. Each model exhibited initial learning and larger belief updating while settling to a relatively-stable state over time. While more research is required, the current simulation implies that architectural solutions may not be sufficiently robust to adequately account for influence and conformity effects, while the homophily-based trust model was able to model these effects driven by the dynamics of human memory. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1007/s10845-019-01478-9,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,"This paper provides a methodology to assess the optimal multi-agent architecture for collaborative prognostics in modern fleets of assets. The use of multi-agent systems has been shown to improve the ability to predict equipment failures by enabling machines with communication and collaborative learning capabilities. Different architectures have been postulated for industrial multi-agent systems in general. A rigorous analysis of the implications of their implementation for collaborative prognostics is essential to guide industrial deployment. In this paper, we investigate the cost and reliability implications of using different multi-agent systems architectures for collaborative failure prediction and maintenance optimization in large fleets of industrial assets. Results show that purely distributed architectures are optimal for high-value assets, while hierarchical architectures optimize communication costs for low-value assets. This enables asset managers to design and implement multi-agent systems for predictive maintenance that significantly decrease the whole-life cost of their assets. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

The CPPS is known as a trend of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) focusing on flexibility regarding new products and adaptability to new requirements. This paper focuses on two I4.0 scenarios described by the Platform Industrie 4.0 that describe challenges for the industry towards its digital future. First, it looks at the Order Controlled Production (OCP) scenario that deals with flexible and self-configuring production networks. It describes the dynamic organization of production resources required to execute a production order. Second, the Adaptable Factory (AF) application scenario is discussed, which focuses on the configuration of production resources and describes the adaptability of an individual facility through (physical) modification. This paper first provides a detailed analysis of the requirements from these scenarios. Furthermore, it analyses the current Multi-Agent System (MAS) architectures and agent-based planning and decision support systems requirements. MAS can be used to create application-independent I4.0 systems with arbitrary hardware automation platforms. To create a scalable communication network that also supports application independence and enables the semantically machine-readable description of the exchanged data, the OPC UA standard was adopted. As a result of the study, the concept shows how different and independent automation platforms can be seamlessly connected via OPC UA. The proposed MAS concept has been evaluated in different use cases, namely OCP and AF. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1007/s10845-023-02278-y,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,"To achieve a highly agile and flexible production, a transformational shift is envisioned whereby industrial production systems evolve to be more decentralized, interconnected, and intelligent. Within this vision, production assets collaborate with each other, exhibiting a high degree of autonomy. Furthermore, information about individual production assets is accessible throughout their entire life-cycles. To realize this vision, the use of advanced information technology is required. Two commonly applied software paradigms in this context are Software Agents (referred to as Agents) and Digital Twins (DTs). This work presents a systematic comparison of Agents and DTs in industrial applications. The goal of the study is to determine the differences, similarities, and potential synergies between the two paradigms. The comparison is based on the purposes for which Agents and DTs are applied, the properties and capabilities exhibited by these software paradigms, and how they can be allocated within the Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0. The comparison reveals that Agents are commonly employed in the collaborative planning and execution of production processes, while DTs are generally more applied to monitor production resources and process information. Although these observations imply characteristic sets of capabilities and properties for both Agents and DTs, a clear and definitive distinction between the two paradigms cannot be made. Instead, the analysis indicates that production assets utilizing a combination of Agents and DTs would demonstrate high degrees of intelligence, autonomy, sociability, and fidelity. To achieve this, further standardization is required, particularly in the field of DTs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1007/s10845-024-02494-0,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,"Self-organizing manufacturing network has emerged as a viable solution for adaptive manufacturing control within the mass personalization paradigm. This approach involves three critical elements: system modeling and control architecture, interoperable communication, and adaptive manufacturing control. However, current research often separates interoperable communication from adaptive manufacturing control as isolated areas of study. To address this gap, this paper introduces Knowledge Graph-enhanced Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method that integrates interoperable communication via Knowledge Graphs with adaptive manufacturing control through Reinforcement Learning. We hypothesize that implicit domain knowledge obtained from historical production job allocation records can guide each agent to learn more effective scheduling policies with accelerated learning rates. This is based on the premise that machine assignment preferences effectively could reduce the Reinforcement Learning search space. Specifically, we redesign machine agents with new observation, action, reward, and cooperation mechanisms considering the preference of machines, building upon our previous MARL base model. The scheduling policies are trained under extensive simulation experiments that consider manufacturing requirements. During the training process, our approach demonstrates improved training speed compared with individual Reinforcement Learning methods under the same training hyperparameters. The obtained scheduling policies generated by our Knowledge Graph-enhanced MARL also outperform both individual Reinforcement Learning methods and heuristic rules under dynamic manufacturing settings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1007/s10845-025-02654-w,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,"In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems present a viable solution for achieving greater storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of multi-deep storage systems. Building on this background, this work presents a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to optimize the retrieval process in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and objective function is total tardiness minimization. To effectively capture the system’s topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep warehouse. For processing this representation, we design a novel neural network architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer’s strong generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in optimizing retrieval tardiness. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1007/s10846-021-01348-8,Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications,"The main goal in task planning is to build a sequence of actions that takes an agent from an initial state to a goal state. In robotics, this is particularly difficult because actions usually have several possible results, and sensors are prone to produce measurements with error. Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are commonly employed, thanks to their ability to model the uncertainty of actions that modify and monitor the state of a system. However, since solving a POMDP is computationally expensive, their usage becomes prohibitive for most robotic applications. In this article, we propose a task planning architecture for service robotics. In the context of service robot design, we present a scheme to encode knowledge about the robot and its environment, that promotes the modularity and reuse of information. Also, we introduce a new recursive definition of a POMDP that enables our architecture to autonomously build a hierarchy of POMDPs, so that it can be used to generate and execute plans that solve the task at hand. Experimental results show that, in comparison to baseline methods, by following a recursive hierarchical approach the architecture is able to significantly reduce the planning time, while maintaining (or even improving) the robustness under several scenarios that vary in uncertainty and size. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

To address the challenges associated with continuous learning constraints and knowledge capacity in this context, cognitive architectures inspired by human cognition have gained significance. This study contributes to existing research by introducing a cognitive-attentional system employing a constructive neural network-based learning approach for continuous acquisition of procedural knowledge. We replace an incremental tabular Reinforcement Learning algorithm with a constructive neural network deep reinforcement learning mechanism for continuous sensorimotor knowledge acquisition, thereby enhancing the overall learning capacity. The primary emphasis of this modification centers on optimizing memory utilization and reducing training time. Our study presents a learning strategy that amalgamates deep reinforcement learning with procedural learning, mirroring the incremental learning process observed in human sensorimotor development. This approach is embedded within the CONAIM cognitive-attentional architecture, leveraging the cognitive tools of CST. The proposed learning mechanism allows the model to dynamically create and modify elements in its procedural memory, facilitating the reuse of previously acquired functions and procedures. Additionally, it equips the model with the capability to combine learned elements to effectively adapt to complex scenarios. A constructive neural network was employed, initiating with an initial hidden layer comprising one neuron. However, it possesses the capacity to adapt its internal architecture in response to its performance in procedural and sensorimotor learning tasks, inserting new hidden layers or neurons. Experimentation conducted through simulations involving a humanoid robot demonstrates the successful resolution of tasks that were previously unsolved through incremental knowledge acquisition. Throughout the training phase, the constructive agent achieved a minimum of 40% greater rewards and executed 8% more actions when compared to other agents. In the subsequent testing phase, the constructive agent exhibited a 15% increase in the number of actions performed in contrast to its counterparts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

10.1007/s10922-017-9405-4,Journal of Network and Systems Management,"Since the concept of merging the capabilities of mobile devices and cloud computing is becoming increasingly popular, an important question is how to optimally schedule services/tasks between the device and the cloud. The main objective of this article is to investigate the possibilities for using machine learning on mobile devices in order to manage the execution of services within the framework of Mobile Cloud Computing. In this study, an agent-based architecture with learning possibilities is proposed to solve this problem. Two learning strategies are considered: supervised and reinforcement learning. The solution proposed leverages, among other things, knowledge about mobile device resources, network connection possibilities and device power consumption, as a result of which a decision is made with regard to the place where the task in question is to be executed. By employing machine learning techniques, the agent working on a mobile device gains experience in determining the optimal place for the execution of a given type of task. The research conducted allowed for the verification of the solution proposed in the domain of multimedia file conversion and demonstrated its usefulness in reducing the time required for task execution. Using the experience gathered as a result of subsequent series of tests, the agent became more efficient in assigning the task of multimedia file conversion to either the mobile device or cloud computing resources. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

We map the problem of creating an agent program on to multiple learning problems that can be represented in a ""supervised concept learning'' setting. The acquired procedural knowledge is partitioned into a hierarchy of goals and represented with first order rules. Using an inductive logic programming (ILP) learning component allows our framework to naturally combine structured behavior observations, parametric and hierarchical goal annotations, and complex background knowledge. To deal with the large domains we consider, we have developed an efficient mechanism for storing and retrieving structured behavior data. We have tested our approach using artificially created examples and behavior observation traces generated by AI agents.

10.1007/s10994-023-06383-0,Machine Learning,"Human social learning is an effective process that has inspired many existing machine learning approaches, such as learning from observation and learning by demonstration. In this paper, we introduce another form of social learning, learning from a casual conversation or LCC a machine learning approach in which an artificially intelligent agent learns new information through an extended natural language dialog with a human. Our system enables the agent to add or change information in its knowledge base as a result of the human’s conversational text inputs. LCC seeks to close an important gap in the state of the art that has focused on teaching computer agents how to perform specific tasks. Furthermore, LCC could also provide an efficient way to enhance the knowledge base of certain types of systems without requiring the involvement of a programmer. LCC does not require the user to enter specific information; instead, the user can converse naturally with the agent. As part of its learning process, LCC identifies the text inputs from the conversing human that contain information worth learning, and then determines whether the inputs are heretofore unknown and learns it; in agreement with what it already “knows” and ignores it; or in conflict with what it “knows” and it must resolve the conflict. LCC’s architecture consists of multiple sub-systems combined to perform the above tasks. Its learning component can add new information to the knowledge base, confirm existing information, and/or update existing information found to be related to the user input. The LCC system functionality was rigorously assessed with test statements comprising various difficulty levels. Furthermore, its acceptance by human users was evaluated by two separate groups of human test subjects—one group who interacted with the system, and a second group that evaluated the logs of the interactions of the first group. The collected results were all found to be acceptable and within the range of our expectations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Brooks proposal boils down to the architectural rejection of central control in intelligent agents-Which, however, turns out to be crucial.

One core feature that humans bring to tasks, when dealing with the ambiguity, emergent knowledge, and social context presented by the world, is reflection.

10.1007/s11235-025-01324-9,Telecommunication Systems,"Conflicting goals of self-organizing components in O-RAN open, modularized architectures present a major issue for the management of telecommunications networks. The use of autonomic network control results in individual management applications making real-time reconfigurations to the network without user intervention. A major unresolved challenge presents as each autonomic agent operates with its own specific goals, resulting in potential conflicting actions. Many orchestration techniques have been proposed to avoid deploying components that do not work together harmoniously due to competing goals and effects. However, efficient operation of a telecommunications network involves trade-offs between competing goals. This paper proposes the CAMINO - Contextually Aware Mediation of Intent for Network Orchestration architecture as an extension to the O-RAN Software Management and Orchestration (SMO) function. CAMINO preemptively detects conflicts between the individual reconfiguration actions of competing components. CAMINO implements a novel, contextual, enhanced intent-based architecture utilizing information from non-traditional sources to determine how to resolve the conflict. CAMINO facilitates the operator’s intent for the network through analysis of both telecommunications data sources and external data sources, i.e., weather, traffic, planned events, incident information. CAMINO preemptively detects conflict between the competing actions of autonomic network configuration functions. Reconfiguration actions in the network that are predicted to cause degradation of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) can be over-ridden using preemptive conflict detection. CAMINO specifically targets predicted network degradations that conflict with the current intent of the network operator, are contra-indicated by telecommunications data sources, or are assessed as being incompatible with current conditions in the operating environment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Our proposed architecture learns to map from first-person views and plans a sequence of actions towards goals in the environment.

CMP constructs a top-down belief map of the world and applies a differentiable neural net planner to produce the next action at each time step. The accumulated belief of the world enables the agent to track visited regions of the environment. We train and test CMP on navigation problems in simulation environments derived from scans of real world buildings. Our experiments demonstrate that CMP outperforms alternate learning-based architectures, as well as, classical mapping and path planning approaches in many cases.

However, current HISs are primarily designed to function as office applications rather than as comprehensive management and supporting tools. Due to their inflexible architecture, integrating modern technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) models and medical robotics (MR) is hindered. Therefore, we have conceptualized an object-oriented HIS (oHIS) as a pragmatic digital twin (PDT) of the entire patient care in a hospital and developed a functional research framework software for further investigations to bridge the gap between reality and models via oHIS. Material and methods: In an interdisciplinary team of engineers and physicians, we conducted a requirements assessment on the surgical wards of the TUM University Hospital in Munich. Then, we designed the research framework named OMNI-SYS and developed it into a functional research platform capable of bridging the gap between a model management system and real-world agents. Finally, we evaluated the framework simulating a clinical use case. Results: Our analysis revealed that future-proof HIS is an under-researched topic. The integration of new technologies into clinical practice is not sufficiently prepared. Therefore, our approach could solve this shortcoming allowing for human agents, devices, models, and robots to interact in a PDT. Models can be integrated as quasi-natural objects and interact with representations of tangible objects in real time. This approach enables even the integration of new technologies that are still unimaginable today. Our oHIS research framework enabled a functional object representation in a simulated use case. Conclusion: oHIS could significantly facilitate the integration of future technologies like AI models and MR. The OMNI-SYS framework could serve as a cornerstone for further research into this new approach.

10.1007/s11633-017-1093-8,International Journal of Automation and Computing,"The recently introduced theory of practopoiesis offers an account on how adaptive intelligent systems are organized. According to that theory, biological agents adapt at three levels of organization and this structure applies also to our brains. This is referred to as tri-traversal theory of the organization of mind or for short, a T3-structure. To implement a similar T3-organization in an artificially intelligent agent, it is necessary to have multiple policies, as usually used as a concept in the theory of reinforcement learning. These policies have to form a hierarchy. We define adaptive practopoietic systems in terms of hierarchy of policies and calculate whether the total variety of behavior required by real-life conditions of an adult human can be satisfactorily accounted for by a traditional approach to artificial intelligence based on T2-agents, or whether a T3-agent is needed instead. We conclude that the complexity of real life can be dealt with appropriately only by a T3-agent. This means that the current approaches to artificial intelligence, such as deep architectures of neural networks, will not suffice with fixed network architectures. Rather, they will need to be equipped with intelligent mechanisms that rapidly alter the architectures of those networks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Such a paradigm is also desirable for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) tasks, given the combinatorially increased interactions among agents and with the environment. However, in MARL, the paradigm of offline pre-training with online fine-tuning has not been studied, nor even datasets or benchmarks for offline MARL research are available. In this paper, we facilitate the research by providing large-scale datasets and using them to examine the usage of the decision transformer in the context of MARL. We investigate the generalization of MARL offline pre-training in the following three aspects: 1) between single agents and multiple agents, 2) from offline pretraining to online fine tuning, and 3) to that of multiple downstream tasks with few-shot and zero-shot capabilities. We start by introducing the first offline MARL dataset with diverse quality levels based on the StarCraftII environment, and then propose the novel architecture of multi-agent decision transformer (MADT) for effective offline learning. MADT leverages the transformer’s modelling ability for sequence modelling and integrates it seamlessly with both offline and online MARL tasks. A significant benefit of MADT is that it learns generalizable policies that can transfer between different types of agents under different task scenarios. On the StarCraft II offline dataset, MADT outperforms the state-of-the-art offline reinforcement learning (RL) baselines, including BCQ and CQL. When applied to online tasks, the pre-trained MADT significantly improves sample efficiency and enjoys strong performance in both few-short and zero-shot cases.

It commonly uses a sampling-and-updating framework to iteratively improve the solution, where exploration and exploitation are also needed to be well balanced.

10.1007/s12369-024-01172-8,International Journal of Social Robotics,"Recent advances in robotics and artificial intelligence have made it necessary or desired for humans to get involved in interactions with social robots. A key factor for the human acceptance of these robots is their awareness of environmental and social norms. In this paper, we introduce SONAR (for SOcial Norm Aware Robots), a novel robot-agnostic control architecture aimed at enabling social agents to autonomously recognize, act upon, and learn over time social norms during interactions with humans. SONAR integrates several state-of-the-art theories and technologies, including the belief-desire-intention (BDI) model of reasoning and decision making for rational agents, fuzzy logic theory, and large language models, to support adaptive and norm-aware autonomous decision making. We demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of SONAR via real-life experiments involving human-robot interactions (HRI) using a Nao robot for scenarios of casual conversations between the robot and each participant. The results of our experiments show that our SONAR implementation can effectively and efficiently be used in HRI to provide the robot with environmental and social and norm awareness. Compared to a robot with no explicit social and norm awareness, introducing social and norm awareness via SONAR results in interactions that are perceived as more positive and enjoyable by humans, as well as in higher perceived trust in the social robot. Moreover, we investigate, via computer-based simulations, the extent to which SONAR can be used to learn and adapt to the social norms of different societies. The results of these simulations illustrate that SONAR can successfully learn adequate behaviors in a society from a relatively small amount of data. We publicly release the source code of SONAR, along with data and experiments logs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1007/s12369-025-01280-z,International Journal of Social Robotics,"Adaptation to user preferences and the ability to infer and interpret human beliefs and intents, known as the Theory of Mind (ToM), are two critical aspects of effective human-robot collaboration. Despite their importance, very few studies have investigated the impact of adaptive robots with ToM capabilities. This work presents an exploratory comparative study to investigate how social robots simulating ToM capabilities affect user performance and perception. We design a two-tier architecture. The Q-learning agent on the first layer learns the robot’s higher-level behaviour. On the second layer, a heuristic-based ToM infers the user’s intended strategy and is responsible for implementing the robot’s assistance, as well as providing the motivation behind its choice. We conducted a user study in a real-world setting, involving 56 participants who interacted with either an adaptive robot simulating ToM capabilities, or with a robot lacking such capabilities. Our results suggest that participants in the ToM condition performed better, accepted the robot’s assistance more often, and perceived its ability to adapt, predict and detect their intentions to a greater extent. Our preliminary findings could inform future research and pave the way for the design of robot architectures for adaptive behaviour with ToM capabilities, where the choice of action is decoupled from its implementation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1007/s12559-018-9553-1,Cognitive Computation,"From social dining in households to product assembly in manufacturing lines, goal-directed reasoning and cooperation with other agents in shared workspaces is a ubiquitous aspect of our day-to-day activities. Critical for such behaviours is the ability to spontaneously anticipate what is doable by oneself as well as the interacting partner based on the evolving environmental context and thereby exploit such information to engage in goal-oriented action sequences. In the setting of an industrial task where two robots are jointly assembling objects in a shared workspace, we describe a bioinspired neural architecture for goal-directed action planning based on coupled interactions between multiple internal models, primarily of the robot’s body and its peripersonal space. The internal models (of each robot’s body and peripersonal space) are learnt jointly through a process of sensorimotor exploration and then employed in a range of anticipations related to the feasibility and consequence of potential actions of two industrial robots in the context of a joint goal. The ensuing behaviours are demonstrated in a real-world industrial scenario where two robots are assembling industrial fuse-boxes from multiple constituent objects (fuses, fuse-stands) scattered randomly in their workspace. In a spatially unstructured and temporally evolving assembly scenario, the robots employ reward-based dynamics to plan and anticipate which objects to act on at what time instances so as to successfully complete as many assemblies as possible. The existing spatial setting fundamentally necessitates planning collision-free trajectories and avoiding potential collisions between the robots. Furthermore, an interesting scenario where the assembly goal is not realizable by either of the robots individually but only realizable if they meaningfully cooperate is used to demonstrate the interplay between perception, simulation of multiple internal models and the resulting complementary goal-directed actions of both robots. Finally, the proposed neural framework is benchmarked against a typically engineered solution to evaluate its performance in the assembly task. The framework provides a computational outlook to the emerging results from neurosciences related to the learning and use of body schema and peripersonal space for embodied simulation of action and prediction. While experiments reported here engage the architecture in a complex planning task specifically, the internal model based framework is domain-agnostic facilitating portability to several other tasks and platforms. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1007/s12559-019-09685-5,Cognitive Computation,"One of the aims of cognitive robotics is to endow robots with the ability to plan solutions for complex goals and then to enact those plans. Additionally, robots should react properly upon encountering unexpected changes in their environment that are not part of their planned course of actions. This requires a close coupling between deliberative and reactive control flows. From the perspective of robotics, this coupling generally entails a tightly integrated perceptuomotor system, which is then loosely connected to some specific form of deliberative system such as a planner. From the high-level perspective of automated planning, the emphasis is on a highly functional system that, taken to its extreme, calls perceptual and motor modules as services when required. This paper proposes to join the perceptual and acting perspectives via a unique representation where the responses of all software modules in the architecture are generalized using the same set of tokens. The proposed representation integrates symbolic and metric information. The proposed approach has been successfully tested in CLARC, a robot that performs Comprehensive Geriatric Assessments of elderly patients. The robot was favourably appraised in a survey conducted to assess its behaviour. For instance, using a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), patients reported an average of 4.86 when asked if they felt confident during the interaction with the robot. This paper proposes a mechanism for bringing the perceptual and acting perspectives closer within a distributed robotics architecture. The idea is built on top of the blackboard model and scene graphs. The modules in our proposal communicate using a short-term memory, writing the perceptual information they need to share with other agents and accessing the information they need for determining the next goals to address. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

The accompanying lack of information is a source of high-stress pressure and anxiety for emergency medical services authorities. Deciding on the best proactive plan and action in this environment is a complicated process, which calls for intelligent agents to automatically produce knowledge in the manner of human-like intelligence. Research in high-stakes decision-making systems has increasingly focused on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), but recent developments in prediction systems give little prominence to explanations based on human-like intelligence. This work investigates XAI based on cause-and-effect interpretations for supporting high-stakes decisions. We review recent applications in the first aid and medical emergency fields based on three perspectives: available data, desirable knowledge, and the use of intelligence. We identify the limitations of recent AI, and discuss the potential of XAI for dealing with such limitations.

In 1987, Bratman proposed their integration into a belief–desire–intention (BDI) theory that was seminal in AI. Since then numerous approaches were built on the BDI paradigm, both practical (BDI architectures and BDI agents) and formal (BDI logics). The logical approaches that were most influential are due to Cohen and Levesque and to Rao and Georgeff. However, three fundamental problems remain up to now. First, the practical and the formal approaches evolved separately and neither fertilised the other. Second, only few formal approaches addressed some important issues such as the revision of intentions or the fundamentally paraconsistent nature of desires, and it seems fair to say that there is currently no consensical, comprehensive logical account of intentions. Finally, only few publications study the interaction between intention and other concepts that are naturally connected to intention, such as actions, planning, and the revision of beliefs and intentions. Our paper summarizes the state of the art, discusses the main open problems, and sketches how they can be addressed. We argue in particular that research on intention should be better connected to fields such as reasoning about actions, automated planning, and belief revision and update. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1007/s13243-020-00081-z,Journal of Remanufacturing,"Introduction: Motivated by high ecological and economical potentials and driven by new laws, remanufacturing is receiving increasing attention as a process that puts used products into “as good as new or better” condition. Within this process, there are many challenges, which are unseen in manufacturing, such as the uncertainties resulting from unknown conditions of the used products. This places special demands on the control of the remanufacturing system (RS). Methodology: To handle these uncertainties an agent-based hybrid control architecture comprising centralized and decentralized components is presented. In the former, the scheduling takes place including the consideration of the use of automated guided vehicles (AGV) to realize flexible material handling within the RS. The scheduling of machines and AGVs is thereby considered simultaneously and not separately, as it is the case in currently available control systems. For the optimization of the simultaneous scheduling Constraint Programming (CP) is used. In the decentralized component, all participants within the RS will be networked as a cyber-physical system and controlled by respective agents. These agents can communicate with each other in order to find solutions. The architecture is implemented as a multi-agent system. Results: Simulation results, using benchmark instances, show that simultaneous scheduling results in a 19.7% reduction of the makespan. Furthermore, the CP-based approach delivers the best results, compared to other approaches for simultaneous scheduling, which are also achieved in a significantly shorter computing time. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1007/s13748-025-00394-9,Progress in Artificial Intelligence,"This work presents a novel architecture for an open-ended learning system that integrates intrinsic motivation (IM) and classical planning to enable agents continuously learn and improve their knowledge over time in an unsupervised fashion. The main goal is to allow the agent to autonomously distill its experience into Probabilistic Planning Domain Definition Language (PPDDL) terms, thereby making causal relationships explicit and supporting automated planning. Starting with a virtually empty set of predefined tasks or goals, the agent harnesses intrinsic motivation to explore the environment autonomously, continuously using and enriching the high-level knowledge acquired through its experience in a virtuous cycle. Experimental evaluation in the Treasure Game domain demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach: starting with only a small set of primitive actions, we show how an agent can autonomously build and refine a high-level representation of the environment. Planning-based strategies grounded in this representation significantly outperform uninformed exploration by reaching intermediate sub-goals more efficiently and substantially reducing the time required to achieve the final objective. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1007/s40295-021-00288-7,Journal of the Astronautical Sciences,"Leading space agencies are increasingly investing in the gradual automation of space missions. In fact, autonomous flight operations may be a key enabler for on-orbit servicing, assembly and manufacturing (OSAM) missions, carrying inherent benefits such as cost and risk reduction. Within the spectrum of proximity operations, this work focuses on autonomous path-planning for the reconstruction of geometry properties of an uncooperative target. The autonomous navigation problem is called active Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem, and it has been largely studied within the field of robotics. Active SLAM problem may be formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Previous works in astrodynamics have demonstrated that is possible to use Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to teach an agent that is moving along a pre-determined orbit when to collect measurements to optimize a given mapping goal. In this work, different RL methods are explored to develop an artificial intelligence agent capable of planning sub-optimal paths for autonomous shape reconstruction of an unknown and uncooperative object via imaging. Proximity orbit dynamics are linearized and include orbit eccentricity. The geometry of the target object is rendered by a polyhedron shaped with a triangular mesh. Artificial intelligent agents are created using both the Deep Q-Network (DQN) and the Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) method. State-action value functions are approximated using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and trained according to RL principles. Training of the RL agent architecture occurs under fixed or random initial environment conditions. A large database of training tests has been collected. Trained agents show promising performance in achieving extended coverage of the target. Policy learning is demonstrated by displaying that RL agents, at minimum, have higher mapping performance than agents that behave randomly. Furthermore, RL agent may learn to maneuver the spacecraft to control target lighting conditions as a function of the Sun location. This work, therefore, preliminary demonstrates the applicability of RL to autonomous imaging of an uncooperative space object, thus setting a baseline for future works. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Given the increasing number of propositions of multi-agent systems (MAS) for smart grids control, operation and restoration, these frameworks must be compatible with agent concepts. Although multi-agent systems for processing oscillographic data have been proposed, no proper method was developed to demonstrate computational benefits in the case of high volume of data. In order to address this matter, this paper proposes a set of guidelines for the development of MAS. Based on the proposed architecture, a prototype was developed, and a set of tests were performed on the oscillographic database of the Itaipu power plant, which includes the evaluation of oscillography classification accuracy, the analysis of parallel processing and the automatic analysis of a set of real disturbances.

In this paper we reflect on the influence of the PHelpS peer help system on our subsequent research agenda as well as some of the broader influences of our work. In particular, we discuss a number of research projects arising out of PHelpS directly or indirectly, including the I-Help (aka iHelp) system, a peer help system that has been widely deployed in university courses; a distributed multi-agent architecture for peer help systems that uses fragmented learner modelling to support its activities; the active user modelling paradigm which views ""learner model"" as a computation not a knowledge structure; the ecological approach, a general architecture for learning systems in which patterns mined from learner interactions with learning objects inform pedagogical decisions; investigations, especially into privacy and reputation, arising from the large scale deployment of iHelp supported by evidence mined from iHelp data; and research into novel affective and social motivation techniques.

Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 1, 94–111 2013). However, constructing tutoring systems that are pedagogically effective has been widely recognized as a challenging problem (Murray 2003; Murray, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 10, 98–129, 1999). In this paper, we explore the use of computational models of apprentice learning, or computer models that learn interactively from examples and feedback, for authoring expert-models via demonstrations and feedback (Matsuda et al. International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 25(1), 1–34 2014) across a wide range of domains. To support these investigations, we present the Apprentice Learner Architecture, which posits the types of knowledge, performance, and learning components needed for apprentice learning. We use this architecture to create two models: the Decision Tree model, which non-incrementally learns skills, and the Trestle model, which instead learns incrementally. Both models draw on the same small set of prior knowledge (six operators and three types of relational knowledge) to support expert model authoring. Despite their limited prior knowledge, we demonstrate their use for efficiently authoring a novel experimental design tutor and show that they are capable of learning an expert model for seven additional tutoring systems that teach a wide range of knowledge types (associations, categories, and skills) across multiple domains (language, math, engineering, and science). This work shows that apprentice learner models are efficient for authoring tutors that would be difficult to build with existing non-programmer authoring approaches (e.g., experimental design or stoichiometry tutors). Further, we show that these models can be applied to author tutors across eight tutor domains even though they only have a small, fixed set of prior knowledge. This work lays the foundation for new interactive machine-learning based authoring paradigms that empower teachers and other non-programmers to build pedagogically effective educational technologies at scale. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1007/s40747-023-00985-w,Complex and Intelligent Systems,"Multi-agent multi-target search strategies can be utilized in complex scenarios such as post-disaster search and rescue by unmanned aerial vehicles. To solve the problem of fixed target and trajectory, the current multi-agent multi-target search strategies are mainly based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, the training of agents by the DRL tend to be brittle due to their sensitivity to the training environment, which makes the strategies learned by the agents fall into local optima frequently, resulting in poor system robustness. Additionally, sparse rewards in DRL will lead to the problems such as difficulty in system convergence and low utilization efficiency of the sampled data. To address the problem that the robustness of the agents is weakened and the sparse rewards exist in the multi-objective search environment, we propose a MiniMax Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient based on the Parallel Hindsight Experience Replay (PHER-M3DDPG) algorithm, which adopts the framework of centralized training and decentralized execution in continuous action space. To enhance the system robustness, the PHER-M3DDPG algorithm employs a minimax learning architecture, which adaptively adjusts the learning strategy of agents by involving adversarial disturbances. In addition, to solve the sparse rewards problem, the PHER-M3DDPG algorithm adopts a parallel hindsight experience replay mechanism to increase the efficiency of data utilization by involving virtual learning targets and batch processing of the sampled data.

Recently, the large language model (LLM) has demonstrated immense potential across various fields with its unique planning and reasoning abilities. However, there are still many challenges beyond its capabilities due to deficiencies in its training data and inherent illusions. Thus, integrating LLMs and tools into tool learning agents has become a new emerging research direction. To this end, we present a systematic investigation and comprehensive review of tool-learning agents in this paper. We start by introducing the definition of the tool learning task for Agents and then illustrating the typical architecture of the tool-learning models. Since these tools are all defined by users, LLM does not know what tools there are and what their functions are. Thus, LLMs should first find appropriate tools and split the tool retrieval methods into two categories: training-based and non-training-based. To accurately complete the user task, it is important to decompose the task into several sub-tasks and execute them in the correct order. Following that, we introduce the tool planning methods and organize these works by whether they rely on the model’s inherent reasoning capabilities for planning or utilize external reasoning tools. Due to the rapid development of this field, we also introduce an emerging frontier direction: using multimodal tools for LLM. In addition, we compile current open-source benchmarks and evaluation metrics, focusing on their scale, composition, calculation methods, and assessment dimensions. Next, we introduce several application scenarios for the LLM-based tool learning methods. Finally, we discuss the safety and ethical issues involved in tool learning. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Effective resolution of this issue is pivotal for attaining rapid situational awareness in expansive, time-sensitive missions such as disaster mitigation and strategic intelligence gathering. Nonetheless, prevailing methodologies for multi-UAV search frequently encounter limitations in concurrently achieving exhaustive spatial coverage and elevated target acquisition efficacy. To overcome these deficiencies, this study introduces a dual-timescale hierarchical reinforcement learning paradigm tailored for collaborative multi-UAV search missions. The proposed Dual-Timescale Hierarchical Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DTH-MADDPG) architecture incorporates a high-level strategic controller and an array of low-level decentralized agents, thereby enabling temporally stratified policy optimization.

This provides a new avenue for real-time data processing on a global scale. However, effectively scheduling tasks to optimize resource utilization, reduce processing delay, and ensure the timeliness of task execution has become a critical issue in SatEC. Existing task scheduling algorithms often fail to fully consider task deadlines and priority orders, leading to deficiencies in handling urgent tasks and optimizing overall computational efficiency. In response to these issues, we propose a multi-agent advantage actor-critic (MA2C) algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, aiming to effectively address the task scheduling challenges in SatEC. The MA2C algorithm employs two cooperative agents to optimize scheduling strategies: one agent is responsible for prioritizing tasks, while the other focuses on task offloading decisions. These two agents interact in real-time, dynamically adjusting their strategies to adapt to environmental changes, effectively enhancing scheduling efficiency. Furthermore, the agent design adopts an encoder-decoder architecture, combined with self-attention (SA) mechanisms and temporal convolutional network (TCN) technology to extract environmental features, achieving real-time optimization of task scheduling. The simulation results indicate that the MA2C algorithm outperforms existing algorithms across various scenarios.

GATR integrates the Actor-Critic architecture with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE), and innovatively introduces a topology-aware dual-channel graph modeling mechanism to dynamically aggregate neighborhood information while explicitly encoding physical interference relationships, thereby mitigating partial observability constraints.

10.1007/s44443-025-00311-z,Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences,"Retrieving relevant medical cases or documents is a critical information retrieval (IR) task in clinical decision support, particularly in cardiology, yet traditional search methods struggle with complex semantic queries in healthcare. Recent advances in large language models offer powerful language understanding, but LLMs alone cannot reliably retrieve factual cases due to knowledge cutoffs and hallucinations. We focus on a case retrieval task – given a textual description of a patient case, find similar prior cases or pertinent literature – formulated as a general IR problem rather than a purely medical study. Conventional lexical methods often miss semantic similarities, while static dense retrievers falter on out-of-domain medical vocabularies. LLMs can comprehend queries and context, but without external knowledge they may produce inaccurate or non-transparent results. We propose a novel LLM-augmented multi-agent retrieval framework that marries an LLM with dedicated retrieval agents in an iterative cooperation mechanism. Our method uses a LLM as a “planner” agent to reformulate queries and integrate medical (e.g., cardiology) context, and a retrieval agent (with a knowledge index) to fetch candidate cases; the agents interact iteratively, refining search and reranking results via a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) loop. This multi-agent design contributes three innovations: (1) an iterative query refinement strategy guided by LLM reasoning chains; (2) a cooperative retrieval architecture where an LLM agent and a search agent exchange information to improve relevance; (3) an LLM-based relevance estimator that grounds the LLM with retrieved evidence to mitigate hallucinations. Experiments on three open medical text datasets show our method outperforms baseline models by 5.3–6.1 percentage points in Recall@10 and NDCG, with statistically significant gains. We also observe improved generalization to novel conditions and robustness to query noise compared to baselines. The proposed framework, while validated on medical text, is broadly applicable to other knowledge-intensive retrieval tasks (legal case search, technical support archives), providing a foundation for intelligent IR systems that leverage both learning-based understanding and explicit retrieval for transparency and up-to-date knowledge. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Unfortunately, integrating devices from different architectures or wireless technologies into a single sensor network is not an easy task for designers and developers. In this sense, distributed architectures, such as service-oriented architectures and multi-agent systems, can facilitate the integration of heterogeneous sensor networks. In addition, the sensors' capabilities can be expanded by means of intelligent agents that change their behavior dynamically.

HERA is based on Services laYers over Light PHysical devices (SYLPH), a distributed platform which integrates a service-oriented approach into heterogeneous WSNs. As SYLPH, HERA can be executed over multiple devices independently of their wireless technology, their architecture or the programming language they use. However, HERA goes one step ahead of SYLPH and adds reactive agents to the platform and also a reasoning mechanism that provides HERA Agents with Case-Based Planning features that allow solving problems considering past experiences.

10.1016/j.aei.2025.103135,Advanced Engineering Informatics,"Object-goal navigation is a task in embodied AI where an agent is navigated to a specified object within unfamiliar indoor scenarios. This task is crucial for engineering activities such as training agents in 3D simulated environments and deploying these models in actual mobile robots. Extensive research has been conducted to develop various navigation methods, including end-to-end reinforcement learning and modular map-based approaches. However, fully enabling an agent to perceive and understand the environment, and to navigate towards a target object as efficiently as humans, remains a considerable challenge. In this study, we introduce a data-driven and modular map-based approach, trained on a dataset incorporated with common-sense knowledge of object-to-room relationships extracted from a Large Language Model (LLM), aiming to enhance the efficiency of object-goal navigation. This approach enables the agent to seek the target object in rooms where it is commonly found (e.g., a bed in a bedroom, a couch in a living room), according to LLM-based common-sense knowledge. Additionally, we employ the multi-channel Swin-Unet architecture for multi-task learning, integrating multimodal sensory inputs to effectively extract meaningful features for spatial comprehension and navigation. Results from the Habitat simulator show that our framework surpasses the baseline by an average of 10.6% in the Success-weighted by Path Length (SPL) efficiency metric. Real-world demonstrations confirm that our method can effectively navigate multiple rooms in the object-goal navigation task.

This paper explores the application of LLM-powered agent systems in drone-based visual inspection, focusing on three core aspects. First, a multi-agent framework is proposed, composed of five specialized sub-agents—Router, PathPlanner, Controller, Perceptioner, and Retriever—that collaboratively handle inspection subtasks such as 3D spatial reasoning, path planning, and UAV control. Second, a novel image-based pipeline is introduced to generate multi-criteria semantic point clouds and abstract them into 3D Scene Graphs (3DSGs), enabling spatial-semantic reasoning aligned with human intent. These 3DSGs act as both knowledge storage and reasoning engines. Third, the system is evaluated through simulations and laboratory experiments, demonstrating its ability to automate inspection workflows and provide a foundation for extensible AI-agent systems. The results highlight the advantages of LLM-based agents in flexible task delegation and high-level decision-making. While current implementations rely on general-purpose LLMs accessed via commercial APIs—introducing some latency and adaptation gaps—these aspects also point to promising directions for future optimization and domain-specific enhancement. Overall, the study presents an early yet promising step toward collaborative human–machine intelligence in infrastructure inspection, where autonomous agents augment human decision-making through interactive, context-aware support. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.aej.2024.08.105,Alexandria Engineering Journal,"In most practical applications, the feature space of the training datasets and the target domain datasets are inconsistent, or the data distribution between them is inconsistent, which leads to the problem of data starvation and makes it difficult for terminal devices to obtain high accurate results. Aiming at the problems of limited terminal device resources, low accuracy of data processing results, and unsatisfactory processing speed, a Heterogeneous Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) Framework based on Transfer Learning (TL) is proposed, abbreviated as HMECF-TL. This framework adopts a cloud-edge-end three-layer architecture. It uses model transfer to optimize the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model at each layer to achieve the goal of improving data processing speed and accuracy. Furthermore, a multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm having Attention Mechanism (DRLAAM) is designed to further increase the timeliness performance of computation-intensive applications. The performance of HMECSF-TL framework is verified by simulation experiments, which not only reduces the delay by more than 24.66 %, but also improves the accuracy by more than 8.34 %. The framework not only increase the computing capacity to solve the shortage of terminal device resources, but also improve the quality of data processing to solve the problem of data starvation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.aej.2025.04.033,Alexandria Engineering Journal,"Water resource management and disaster response have become some of the most challenging tasks, especially when disasters pose a threat, as delays could lead to more impacts. The centralized system used for water dynamics and disaster control usually presents itself as a scalability problem since more clients present a problem, the system's latency is high, and the system is always prone to a single-point failure. The previous approach lacks flexibility and does not synchronously guarantee the integration of several subjects in real time, especially during unpredictable disaster conditions. The proposed FL-MAPPO model surpasses current methods by facilitating decentralized, privacy-protecting decision-making minimizing latency and single-point failures. In contrast to LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and DRNN, which are based on centralized data processing, FL-MAPPO provides real-time adaptability and effective resource management. Experimental results validate that it has lower MSE, higher R² scores, and quicker response times, making it better suited for flood prediction and disaster response. To this end, this study advances a solution through a Decentralized Learning-Driven Multi-Agent Autonomous System (DL-MAAS). The new feature is a Decentralized Cooperation environment in which intelligent and self-managing agents learn utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Federated Learning (FL) algorithms for enhancing smart water management and real-time disaster relief. IoT devices are adopted for sensing and data acquisition, adaptive learning for decision-making, and optimization of energy use among the agents in the system through metaheuristic algorithms. The research methodology for implementing the proposed solution involves the design of a multi-layered architecture, including data acquisition, decentralized learning, and real-time execution. With a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.112, R-squared (R²) of 0.953, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.207, the proposed method is better than existing approaches for big, real-time flood predictive systems. Data show that decentralized systems provide orders of magnitude higher efficiency in water distribution, time of response to disasters, and energy usage compared to conventional centralized systems. These results indicate the significant opportunity for decentralized multi-agent systems in the sustainability of disaster management and water resources. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.07.081,Applied Energy,"In the UK, buildings contribute about one third of the energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. Space heating and cooling systems are among the biggest energy consumers in buildings. This research aims to develop a novel Building Energy Management System (BEMS) to reduce the energy consumption of the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system while fulfilling each occupant’ thermal comfort requirement. This paper presents a newly developed novel method, Epistemic-Deontic-Axiologic (EDA) Agent-based solution to support the Energy Management System meeting the dual targets of occupant thermal comfort and energy efficiency. The multi-agent solutions are applied to the BEMS. The problem decomposition method is used to define the architecture of the system. The Epistemic-Deontic-Axiologic (EDA) agent model is applied to develop the rational local and personal agents inside the system. These EDA-based agents select their optimal action plan by considering the occupants’ thermal sensations, their behavioural adaptations and the energy consumption of the HVAC system. The Newly-developed personal thermal sensation models and group-of-people-based thermal sensation models generated by support vector machine (SVM) based algorithms are applied to evaluate the occupants’ thermal sensations. These models are developed from the data collected in a real built environment. Simulation results prove that the newly-developed BEMS can help the HVAC system reduce the energy consumption by up to 10% while fulfilling the occupants’ thermal comfort requirements. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116349,Applied Energy,"Distributed energy systems play a significant role in the integration of renewable energy technologies. The Energy Internet links a fleet of distributed energy systems to each other and with the grid. Interactions between the distributed energy systems via information sharing could significantly enhance the efficiency of their real-time operation. However, privacy and security concerns hinder such interactions. A game-theoretic approach can help in this regard, and enable consideration of some of these factors when maintaining interactions between energy systems. Although a game-theoretic approach is used to understand energy systems' operation, such complex interactions between the energy systems are not considered at the early design phase, leading to many practical problems, and often leading to suboptimal designs. The present study introduces a game-theoretic approach that enables consideration of complex interactions among energy systems at the early design phase. Three different architectures are considered in the study, i.e., energy eystem prior to grid (ESPG), fully cooperative (FCS), and non-cooperative (NCS) scenarios, in which each distributed energy system is taken as an agent. A novel distributed optimization algorithm is developed for both FCS and NCS. The study reveals that FCS and NCS reduce the cost, respectively, by 30% and 15% compared to ESPG. In addition to cost reduction, there is a significant change in the energy system design when moving from FCS to NCS scenarios, clearly indicating the requirement for a scenario that lies between NCS and FCS. This will lead to reducing design costs while maintaining privacy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118497,Applied Energy,"The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources has the potential to contribute towards the decarbonisation of the building energy sector. However, this transition brings its own challenges including that of energy integration and potential grid instability issues arising due the stochastic nature of variable renewable energy sources. One potential approach to address these issues is demand side management, which is increasingly seen as a promising solution to improve grid stability. This is achieved by exploiting demand flexibility and shifting peak demand towards periods of peak renewable energy generation. However, the energy flexibility of a single building needs to be coordinated with other buildings to be used in a flexibility market. In this context, multi-agent systems represent a promising tool for improving the energy management of buildings at the district and grid scale. The present research formulates the energy management of four buildings equipped with thermal energy storage and PV systems as a multi-agent problem. Two multi-agent reinforcement learning methods are explored: a centralised (coordinated) controller and a decentralised (cooperative) controller, which are benchmarked against a rule-based controller. The two controllers were tested for three different climates, outperforming the rule-based controller by 3% and 7% respectively for cost, and 10% and 14% respectively for peak demand. The study shows that the multi-agent cooperative approach may be more suitable for districts with heterogeneous objectives within the individual buildings. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

However, the rapid evolution of Agentic AI, including Generative AI (GenAI) agents, has outpaced a cohesive understanding of its applications, challenges, and strategic implications. This narrative review explores the role of Agentic AI in shaping an intelligent future, focusing on its key attributes—autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, and learning ability—and its potential to transform organizational performance. We identify a research gap in synthesizing the diverse capabilities of Agentic AI (e.g., multimodal processing, hierarchical architectures, and machine learning outsourcing) and providing actionable strategies for adoption. The paper examines how Agentic AI enables autonomous decision-making, automates processes, and enhances efficiency through tools like LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, and AutoGPT. It highlights the transition from assisted (“Copilot”) to autonomous (“Autopilot”) models and the importance of hierarchical agent structures for system coordination. Key contributions include a framework for organizations to formulate GenAI strategies, addressing business needs, tool selection, human resource training, and risk management. Findings reveal that Agentic AI significantly improves productivity, reduces costs, and drives innovation, though challenges such as privacy, security, and ethical concerns remain. Future research should focus on industry-specific case studies to deepen understanding, explore the ethical and social impacts (e.g., privacy, data security, labor market effects), and investigate the integration of Agentic AI with emerging technologies like quantum computing.

10.1016/j.artint.2016.07.002,Artificial Intelligence,"Human–Robot Interaction challenges Artificial Intelligence in many regards: dynamic, partially unknown environments that were not originally designed for robots; a broad variety of situations with rich semantics to understand and interpret; physical interactions with humans that requires fine, low-latency yet socially acceptable control strategies; natural and multi-modal communication which mandates common-sense knowledge and the representation of possibly divergent mental models. This article is an attempt to characterise these challenges and to exhibit a set of key decisional issues that need to be addressed for a cognitive robot to successfully share space and tasks with a human. We identify first the needed individual and collaborative cognitive skills: geometric reasoning and situation assessment based on perspective-taking and affordance analysis; acquisition and representation of knowledge models for multiple agents (humans and robots, with their specificities); situated, natural and multi-modal dialogue; human-aware task planning; human–robot joint task achievement. The article discusses each of these abilities, presents working implementations, and shows how they combine in a coherent and original deliberative architecture for human–robot interaction. Supported by experimental results, we eventually show how explicit knowledge management, both symbolic and geometric, proves to be instrumental to richer and more natural human–robot interactions by pushing for pervasive, human-level semantics within the robot's deliberative system. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.artint.2024.104228,Artificial Intelligence,"Compared to autonomous agent learning, lifelong agent learning tackles the additional challenge of accumulating skills in a way favourable to long term development. What an agent learns at a given moment can be an element for the future creation of behaviours of greater complexity, whose purpose cannot be anticipated. Beyond its initial low-level sensorimotor development phase, the agent is expected to acquire, in the same manner as skills, values and goals which support the development of complex behaviours beyond the reactive level. To do so, it must have a way to represent and memorize such information. In this article, we identify the properties suitable for a representation system supporting the lifelong development of agents through a review of a wide range of memory systems and related literature. Following this analysis, our second contribution is the proposition and implementation of such a representation system in MIND, a modular architecture for lifelong development. The new variable module acts as a simple memory system which is strongly integrated to the hierarchies of skill modules of MIND, and allows for the progressive structuration of behaviour around persistent non-symbolic representations. Variable modules have many applications for the development and structuration of complex behaviours, but also offer designers and operators explicit models of values and goals facilitating human interaction, control and explainability. We show through experiments two possible uses of variable modules. In the first experiment, skills exchange information by using a variable representing the concept of “target”, which allows the generalization of navigation behaviours. In the second experiment, we show how a non-symbolic representation can be learned and memorized to develop beyond simple reactive behaviour, and keep track of the steps of a process whose state cannot be inferred by observing the environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

We describe Argus, an approach that melds recent advances in flexible, declarative communication protocols with BDI architectures. For concreteness, we adopt Jason as an exemplar of the BDI paradigm and show how to support protocol-based reasoning in it. Specifically, Argus contributes (1) a novel architecture and formal operational semantics combining protocols and BDI; (2) a code generation-based programming model that guides the implementation of agents; and (3) integrity checking for incoming and outgoing messages that help ensure that the agents are well-behaved. The Argus conceptual architecture builds quite naturally on top of Jason.

10.1016/j.bica.2012.04.005,Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures,"Distributed Adaptive Control (DAC) is a theory of the design principles underlying the Mind, Brain, Body Nexus (MBBN) that has been developed over the last 20. years. DAC assumes that the brain maintains stability between an embodied agent and its environment through action. It postulates that in order to act, or know how, the brain has to answer four fundamental questions: why, what, where, when. Thus the function of the brain is to continuously solve the, so called, H4W problem. The DAC theory is expressed as a robot based neural architecture organized in two complementary structures: layers and columns. The organizational layers are called: reactive, adaptive and contextual and its columnar organization defines the processing of states of the world, the self and the generation of action. Each layer is described with respect to its key hypotheses, implementation and specific benchmarks. After this overview of the key elements of DAC, the mapping of its key assumptions towards the invertebrate and mammalian brain is described. In particular, this review will focus on the systems involved in realizing the core principles underlying the reactive layer: the allostatic control of fundamental behavior systems in the vertebrate brain and the emergent non-linearity through neuronal mass action in the locust brain. The adaptive layer will be analyzed in terms of the classical conditioning paradigm and its neuronal substrate the amygdala-cerebellum-neocortex complex together with episodic memory and the formation of sense-act couplets in the hippocampus. For the contextual layer the ability of circuits in the prefrontal cortex to acquire and express contextual plans for action is described. The general overview of DAC's explanation of MBBN is combined by examples of application scenarios in which DAC has been validated including mobile and humanoid robots, neurorehabilitation and the large-scale interactive space Ada. After 20. years of research DAC can be considered a mature theory of MBBN. It has build up a track record of explaining core aspects of mind, brain and behavior, has made testable and verified predictions at the level of behavior, physiology and anatomy, has been shown to be able to control complex real-world artefacts and has been successfully applied to brain repair and neurorehabilitation.

10.1016/j.bica.2013.05.006,Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures,"A novel way to model an agent interacting with an environment is introduced, called an Enactive Markov Decision Process (EMDP). An EMDP keeps perception and action embedded within sensorimotor schemes rather than dissociated, in compliance with theories of embodied cognition. Rather than seeking a goal associated with a reward, as in reinforcement learning, an EMDP agent learns to master the sensorimotor contingencies offered by its coupling with the environment. In doing so, the agent exhibits a form of intrinsic motivation related to the autotelic principle (Steels, 2004), and a value system attached to interactions called interactional motivation. This modeling approach allows the design of agents capable of autonomous self-programming, which provides rudimentary constitutive autonomy - a property that theoreticians of enaction consider necessary for autonomous sense-making (e.g.; Froese & Ziemke, 2009). A cognitive architecture is presented that allows the agent to discover, memorize, and exploit spatio-sequential regularities of interaction, called Enactive Cognitive Architecture (ECA).

At the same time, the interaction between an artificial agent and the environment is deeply affected by uncertainty due to the imprecision in the description of the world, and the unpredictability of the effects of the agent's actions. Such an agent needs meta-cognition in terms of both self-awareness and control. Self-awareness is related to the internal conditions that may possibly influence the completion of the task, while control is oriented to performing actions that maintain the internal model of the world and the perceptions aligned. In this work, a general meta-cognitive architecture is presented, which is aimed at overcoming these problems. The proposed architecture describes an artificial agent, which is capable to combine cognition and meta-cognition to solve problems in an uncertain world, while reconciling opposing requirements and goals. While executing a plan, such an agent reflects upon its actions and how they can be affected by its internal conditions, and starts a new goal setting process to cope with unforeseen changes. The work defines the concept of ""believability"" as a generic uncertain quantity, the operators to manage believability, and provides the reader with the u-MDP that is a novel MDP able to deal with uncertain quantities expressed as possibility, probability, and fuzziness.

In recent years, many cognitive models have focused on dual process theories to better describe and implement complex cognitive skills in artificial agents, but creativity has been approached only at a descriptive level. In previous works we have described various modules of the cognitive architecture that allows a robot to execute creative paintings. By means of dual process theories we refine some relevant mechanisms to obtain artworks, and in particular we explain details about resolution level of the CA dealing with different strategies of access to the Long Term Memory (LTM) and managing the interaction between S1 and S2 processes of the dual process theory. The creative process involves both divergent and convergent processes in either implicit or explicit manner. This leads to four activities (exploratory, reflective, tacit, and analytic) that, triggered by urges and motivations, generate creative acts. These creative acts exploit both the LTM and the WM in order to make novel substitutions to a perceived image by properly mixing parts of pictures coming from different domains. The paper highlights the role of the interaction between S1 and S2 processes, modulated by the resolution level which focuses the attention of the creative agent by broadening or narrowing the exploration of novel solutions, or even drawing the solution from a set of already made associations.

Integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with Discrete Event Simulation (DES) enables model-free control of flow-shop production systems under non-exponential, stochastic processing times. A Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent dynamically manages WIP levels in a CONstant Work In Progress (CONWIP) environment, learning optimal control policies directly from system interactions. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments with varying machine numbers, processing times, and system variability. The results show robust performance in tracking the target throughput and adapting the processing time variability, achieving Mean Absolute Percentual Errors (MAPE) in the throughput – calculated as the percentage difference between the actual and the target throughput – ranging from 0.3% to 2.3% with standard deviations of 5. 5% to 8. 4%.

Although work on collective intentionality in philosophy, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science has many points of agreement, several key issues remain under debate. This paper argues that the dynamics of intention - in particular, the inter-related processes of plan-related group decision making and intention updating - play crucial roles in an explanation of collective intentionality. Furthermore, it is in these dynamic aspects that coordinated group activity differs most from individual activity. The paper specifies a model of the dynamics of agent intentions in the context of collaborative activity. Its integrated treatment of group decision making and coordinated updating of group-related intentions fills an important gap in prior accounts of collective intentionality, thus helping to resolve a long-standing debate about the nature of intentions in group activity. The paper also defines an architecture for collaboration-capable computer agents that satisfies the constraints of the model and is a natural extension of the standard architecture for resource-bounded agents operating as individuals. The new architecture is both more principled and more complete than prior architectures for collaborative multi-agent systems. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

10.1016/j.cogsys.2011.07.003,Cognitive Systems Research,"We introduce an approach to simulate the early mechanisms of emergent cognition based on theories of enactive cognition and on constructivist epistemology. The agent has intrinsic motivations implemented as inborn proclivities that drive the agent in a proactive way. Following these drives, the agent autonomously learns regularities afforded by the environment, and hierarchical sequences of behaviors adapted to these regularities. The agent represents its current situation in terms of perceived affordances that develop through the agent's experience. This situational representation works as an emerging situation awareness that is grounded in the agent's interaction with its environment and that in turn generates expectations and activates adapted behaviors. Through its activity and these aspects of behavior (behavioral proclivity, situation awareness, and hierarchical sequential learning), the agent starts to exhibit emergent sensibility, intrinsic motivation, and autonomous learning. Following theories of cognitive development, we argue that this initial autonomous mechanism provides a basis for implementing autonomously developing cognitive systems. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.cogsys.2016.12.002,Cognitive Systems Research,"This article presents an agent architecture for controlling an autonomous agent in stochastic, noisy environments. The architecture combines the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model with the belief-desire-intention (BDI) framework. The Hybrid POMDP-BDI agent architecture takes the best features from the two approaches, that is, the online generation of reward-maximizing courses of action from POMDP theory, and sophisticated multiple goal management from BDI theory. We introduce the advances made since the introduction of the basic architecture, including (i) the ability to pursue and manage multiple goals simultaneously and (ii) a plan library for storing pre-written plans and for storing recently generated plans for future reuse. A version of the architecture is implemented and is evaluated in a simulated environment. The results of the experiments show that the improved hybrid architecture outperforms the standard POMDP architecture and the previous basic hybrid architecture for both processing speed and effectiveness of the agent in reaching its goals. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

We argue that such aspects may constitute not only a technological problem that, in our opinion, should be addressed in order to build artificial agents able to exhibit intelligent behaviors in general scenarios, but also an epistemological one, since they limit the plausibility of the comparison of the CAs’ knowledge representation and processing mechanisms with those executed by humans in their everyday activities.

One focus of current development in virtual agents, robotics and digital games is on increasingly complex and realistic systems that more accurately simulate intelligence found in nature. This development introduces a multitude of control parameters creating high computational costs. The resulting complexity limits the applicability of AI systems. One solution to this problem it to focus on smaller, more manageable, and flexible systems which can be simultaneously created, instantiated, and controlled. Here we introduce a biologically inspired systems-engineering approach for enriching behaviour arbitration with a low computational overhead. We focus on an easy way to control the maintenance, inhibition and alternation of high-level behaviours (goals) in cases where static priorities are undesirable. The models we consider here are biomimetic, based on neuro-cognitive research findings from dopaminic cells responsible for controlling goal switching and maintenance in the mammalian brain. The most promising model we find is applicable to selection problems with multiple conflicting goals. It utilizes a ramp function to control the execution and inhibition of behaviours more accurately than previous mechanisms, allowing an additional layer of control on existing behaviour prioritization systems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.cogsys.2019.01.003,Cognitive Systems Research,"CORTEX is a cognitive robotics architecture inspired by three key ideas: modularity, internal modelling and graph representations. CORTEX is also a computational framework designed to support early forms of intelligence in real world, human interacting robots, by selecting an a priori functional decomposition of the capabilities of the robot. This set of abilities was then translated to computational modules or agents, each one built as a network of software interconnected components. The nature of these agents can range from pure reactive modules connected to sensors and/or actuators, to pure deliberative ones, but they can only communicate with each other through a graph structure called Deep State Representation (DSR). DSR is a short-term dynamic representation of the space surrounding the robot, the objects and the humans in it, and the robot itself. All these entities are perceived and transformed into different levels of abstraction, ranging from geometric data to high-level symbolic relations such as “the person is talking and gazing at me”. The combination of symbolic and geometric information endows the architecture with the potential to simulate and anticipate the outcome of the actions executed by the robot. In this paper we present recent advances in the CORTEX architecture and several real-world human-robot interaction scenarios in which they have been tested. We describe our interpretation of the ideas inspiring the architecture and the reasons why this specific computational framework is a promising architecture for the social robots of tomorrow. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.cogsys.2019.01.006,Cognitive Systems Research,"Recent advances in neurosciences and cognitive sciences show us that the human neocortex is not a slave to the experiences from our perception and that the memories stored in hippocampus are goal weighted during the replay of the experiences for the purpose of re-learning from them. Temporal difference reinforcement learning systems that use neural networks as function approximators rely on an experience replay memory structure similar to the hippocampus. We bring forward this similarity and present a novel way of using a goal weighted prioritization of the memory that is biologically inspired. Furthermore, we introduce a novel prioritization criteria called Variety of Experience Index, or VEI, for weighting the selection of the experiences that are stored in the replay memory. Weighting the experiences based on two different extremes of VEI can behaviourally modify the agent's learning process, generating different types of learning agents that exhibit different personality traits along the dimension of Openness to Experience. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

In particular, the proposed framework relies on the assumption that certain classes of problems cannot be solved by simply learning or injecting new external knowledge in the declarative memory of a cognitive artificial agent but, on the other hand, require a mechanism for the automatic and creative re-framing, or re-formulation, of the available knowledge. We show how such mechanism can be obtained trough a framework of dynamic knowledge generation that is able to tackle the problem of commonsense concept combination. In addition, we show how such a framework can be employed in the field of cognitive architectures in order to overcome situations like the impasse in SOAR by extending the possible options of its subgoaling procedures. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.cogsys.2019.09.023,Cognitive Systems Research,"It is difficult to study the mind, but cognitive architectures are one tool. As the mind emerges from the behaviour of the brain, neuropsychological methods are another method to study the mind, though a rather indirect method. A cognitive architecture that is implemented in spiking neurons is a method of studying the mind that can use neuropsychological evidence directly. A neural cognitive architecture, based on rule based systems and associative memory, can be readily implemented, and would provide a good bridge between standard cognitive architectures, such as SOAR, and neuropsychology. This architecture could be implemented in spiking neurons, and made available via the Human Brain Project, which provides a good collaborative environment. The architecture could be readily extended to use spiking neurons for subsystems, such as spatial reasoning, and could evolve over time toward a complete architecture. The theory behind this architecture could evolve over time. Simplifying assumptions, made explicit, such as those behind the rule based system, could gradually be replaced by more neuropsychologically accurate behaviour. The overall task of collaborative architecture development would be eased by direct evidence of the actual neural cognitive architectures in human brains.

10.1016/j.cogsys.2021.11.005,Cognitive Systems Research,"In this paper we present a computational modeling account of an active self in artificial agents. In particular we focus on how an agent can be equipped with a sense of control and how it arises in autonomous situated action and, in turn, influences action control. We argue that this requires laying out an embodied cognitive model that combines bottom-up processes (sensorimotor learning and fine-grained adaptation of control) with top-down processes (cognitive processes for strategy selection and decision-making). We present such a conceptual computational architecture based on principles of predictive processing and free energy minimization. Using this general model, we describe how a sense of control can form across the levels of a control hierarchy and how this can support action control in an unpredictable environment. We present an implementation of this model as well as first evaluations in a simulated task scenario, in which an autonomous agent has to cope with un-/predictable situations and experiences corresponding sense of control. We explore different model parameter settings that lead to different ways of combining low-level and high-level action control. The results show the importance of appropriately weighting information in situations where the need for low/high-level action control varies and they demonstrate how the sense of control can facilitate this. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.cogsys.2023.101188,Cognitive Systems Research,"We review current and emerging knowledge-informed and brain-inspired cognitive systems for realizing adversarial defenses, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), and zero-shot or few-shot learning. Data-driven machine learning models have achieved remarkable performance and demonstrated capabilities surpassing humans in many applications. Yet, their inability to exploit domain knowledge leads to serious performance limitations in practical applications. In particular, deep learning systems are exposed to adversarial attacks, which can trick them into making glaringly incorrect decisions. Moreover, complex data-driven models typically lack interpretability or explainability, i.e., their decisions cannot be understood by human subjects. Furthermore, models are usually trained on standard datasets with a closed-world assumption. Hence, they struggle to generalize to unseen cases during inference in practical open-world environments, thus, raising the zero- or few-shot generalization problem. Although many conventional solutions exist, explicit domain knowledge, brain-inspired neural networks and cognitive architectures offer powerful new dimensions towards alleviating these problems. Prior knowledge is represented in appropriate forms like mathematical relations, logic rules, knowledge graphs, and large language models (LLMs). and incorporated in deep learning frameworks to improve performance. Brain-inspired cognition methods use computational models that mimic the human brain to enhance intelligent behavior in artificial agents and autonomous robots. Ultimately, these models achieve better explainability, higher adversarial robustness and data-efficient learning, and can, in turn, provide insights for cognitive science and neuroscience—that is, to deepen human understanding on how the brain works in general, and how it handles these problems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.cogsys.2024.101234,Cognitive Systems Research,"The theory of Enactive Inference was proposed by Karl Friston and his colleagues to explain how the brain infers knowledge about the world through the subject's interactive experiences. Sensorimotor states induce perturbations in neural activity, and the brain infers hypothetical causes in the world that may explain these perturbations. This article aims to reconcile this neuroscience theory with computer science and artificial-intelligence theories wherein artificial agents receive input data derived from the environment's state and infer internal data structures used to guide decisions. Two critical challenges arise in both the agent's active role and the inference algorithm's scalability as the environment's complexity increases. To address these challenges, we formalize artificial enactive inference through a new Spatial Enactive Markov Decision Process (SEMDP) model. This model rests on low-level control loops enacted in a three-dimensional Euclidean space containing objects. Based on the SEMDP, we present a proof-of-concept cognitive architecture and an experiment to demonstrate the transcription of the theory of enactive inference into the domain of artificial intelligence and robotics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

System 1 is an intuitive, automatic, and fast-thinking system working effortlessly, without conscious effort. System 2 is a deliberate, analytical, and slower-thinking system employing conscious effort and attention. This work proposes an innovative approach that exploits techniques typical of information retrieval (the trie data structure) to efficiently encode the solutions’ repository at the border between System 2 and System 1. This repository stores the solutions (successful plans) the agent has already used and can re-enact to achieve the goals. System 2 conceives new plans and delegates System 1 to execute them. If the plan is successful (and so it becomes a solution), System 1 stores that in the repository to quickly retrieve any solution that may help fulfil the goals deliberated by System 2 in the future. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.cogsys.2025.101338,Cognitive Systems Research,"Despite impressive recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), current deep neural networks still lack the adaptability and energy efficiency inherent to biological systems. Here we suggest that this problem may be overcome by taking inspiration from the brain where neurons operate as autonomous agents, each capable of adjusting its synaptic connections and internal states based on local information. Currently, typical artificial neurons are static nodes, which is in striking contrast to the rich, dynamic computations performed by biological neurons. In this review, we propose redesigning artificial neurons as self-regulating, agent-like units, making actions to maximize future energy/reward. Similarly, as single-celled organisms which can autonomously navigate in complex environments in search for food, neurons can also be viewed as autonomous decision-makers, seeking to maximize their own energy resources. Thus, neurons could be operating similarly like reinforcement learning (RL) agents, which make actions to obtain maximum future reward. Here first we review literature illustrating that biological neurons perform complex computations and employ local, predictive learning rules to anticipate future activity to maximize metabolic energy. Next, we provide examples of recent biologically inspired learning algorithms where artificial neurons are empowered with computational flexibility, similarly to autonomous agents. Networks with neurons using such local learning rules can in some examples outperform current AI algorithms. We also discuss how this can improve scalability of current multi-agent systems (MAS) and energy efficiency. Therefore, designing neurons as autonomous agents may provide an important step toward building human-like cognition. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Methods based on memory replay are commonly adopted in the literature. This work presents a consciousness-based model integrated with a continual learning scheme for class-incremental learning in visual recognition. We suggest a reciprocal relation between memory maintenance and the learning activity of the system based on psychological evidence. The memory capability fits the continual learning problem. In return, a self-evaluation of knowledge mechanism is proposed for the robot to discriminate the important learning data during interactions to alleviate the memory constraint without degrading the distribution representation of abnormal data. The implemented robotic agent autonomously puts more effort into learning novel knowledge without human intervention. The cognitive architecture based on the Global Workspace Theory for the robotic agent is presented, with which the agent can automatically associate information from different modalities. Memory consolidation is implemented to run in parallel to the memory formation process. The work is validated in a class-incremental object recognition experiment on a robotic agent.

Management scalability limitations though, are not adequately addressed when monitoring tasks requiring the employment of multi-hop agents are considered. This is because agent-based architectures lack mechanisms that guarantee near-optimal agents itineraries so as to minimise the total migration cost in terms of the round-trip latency and the incurred traffic. This is of particular importance when the management of networks spanning multiple subnets is involved. To address these issues, we have adapted an algorithm originally designed to solve network design problems to the specific problematic of MA itinerary planning. The algorithm suggests the optimal number of MAs that minimise the overall cost and also constructs optimal itineraries for each of them.

This shift facilitates the transition from a specialized intelligence approach, where artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms handle isolated tasks, to artificial general intelligence (AGI)-driven networks, where agents possess broader reasoning capabilities and can manage diverse network functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel agentic paradigm that combines LLMs with real-time optimization algorithms towards Trustworthy AI, defined as symbiotic agents. Optimizers at the LLM's input-level provide bounded uncertainty steering for numerically precise tasks, whereas output-level optimizers supervised by the LLM enable adaptive real-time control. We design and implement two novel agent types including: (i) Radio Access Network (RAN) optimizers, and (ii) multi-agent negotiators for Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). We further propose an end-to-end architecture for AGI-driven networks and evaluate it on a 5G testbed capturing channel fluctuations from moving vehicles. Results show that symbiotic agents reduce decision errors fivefold compared to standalone LLM-based agents, while smaller language models (SLM) achieve similar accuracy with a 99.9 % reduction in Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) resource overhead and in near-real-time (near-RT) loops of 82ms. A multi-agent demonstration for collaborative RAN on the real-world testbed highlights significant flexibility in service-level agreement and resource allocation, reducing RAN over-utilization by approximately 44 %.

Operators rely on the plant automation system, particularly the DCS, for managing the plant operations which themselves have become open, and involve multiple third-party technologies, instruments, and software. The structural-, scale- and dynamic-complexity makes it challenging for operators to infer the conditions in the plant quickly and make timely decisions, especially during abnormal situations. A process supervision system that assists the operators by providing holistic decision support is therefore essential. Here, we propose an multi agents based architecture for supervision of large-scale chemical plants. The key insight in the proposed architecture is that the process descriptors used for developing the supervision models themselves are not static and change routinely. The proposed architecture uses an ontology to represent all the process descriptors formally, so that any changes can be captured and their effects propagated seamlessly.

The CBR-based approach leverages a historical knowledge base that is dynamically updated based on user feedback, allowing for a more responsive and adaptive system. This feedback plays a crucial role in the processes of case retrieval, review, and retention within the CBR cycle, enabling the system to evolve based on user interactions. An empirical study involving 22 participants was conducted to assess the impact of user feedback on system recommendations. This study included both static and dynamic test scenarios, focusing on aspects such as visibility, support, usefulness, and data integration.

10.1016/j.dajour.2023.100359,Decision Analytics Journal,"Assistant Conversational Agents (chatbots) are becoming increasingly complex and sophisticated since they are enabled to understand and respond to human language. Chatbots have varying organizational functions, from customer support to personal assistance, and have dominated the digital market as they are efficient and effective. Chatbots can collect valuable information from customers through interaction which can result in a better customer experience, but an inappropriate or inadequate response can also lead to the loss of customers. Therefore, the chatbots must be intelligent enough to provide the most efficient and effective response to positively impact the customers and add value to the business and organization. Over the years, several streams of research have been conducted, and multiple chatbots have been created, but they have their limitation, which has been discussed in this article. We suggest a method to upgrade the performance of the chatbots so that they can respond to the user query with better accuracy. The proposed model shows the implementation of a chatbot using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), attention mechanism, Bag of Words (BOW), and beam search decoding. The sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture with an LSTM encoder and decoder has been used. The dialog dataset is preferred to train and test the model, and the BleuN algorithm is used to determine the chatbot's accuracy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.dss.2013.05.017,Decision Support Systems,"In this paper we propose HANA, a software architecture for agents that need to bilaterally negotiate joint plans of action in realistic scenarios. These negotiations may involve humans and are repeated along time. The architecture is based on a BDI model that represents the uncertainty on the environment as graded beliefs, desires and intentions. The architecture is modular and can easily be extended by incorporating different models (e.g. trust, intimacy, personality, normative...) that update the set of beliefs, desires or intentions. The architecture is dynamic as it monitors the environment and updates the beliefs accordingly. We introduce an innovative search& negotiation method that facilitates HANA agents to cope with huge spaces of joint plans. This method implements an anytime search algorithm that generates partial plans to feed the negotiation process. At the same time the negotiation guides the search towards joint plans that are more likely to be accepted. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.dt.2022.04.001,Defence Technology,"The scale of ground-to-air confrontation task assignments is large and needs to deal with many concurrent task assignments and random events. Aiming at the problems where existing task assignment methods are applied to ground-to-air confrontation, there is low efficiency in dealing with complex tasks, and there are interactive conflicts in multiagent systems. This study proposes a multiagent architecture based on a one-general agent with multiple narrow agents (OGMN) to reduce task assignment conflicts. Considering the slow speed of traditional dynamic task assignment algorithms, this paper proposes the proximal policy optimization for task assignment of general and narrow agents (PPO-TAGNA) algorithm. The algorithm based on the idea of the optimal assignment strategy algorithm and combined with the training framework of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) adds a multihead attention mechanism and a stage reward mechanism to the bilateral band clipping PPO algorithm to solve the problem of low training efficiency. Finally, simulation experiments are carried out in the digital battlefield. The multiagent architecture based on OGMN combined with the PPO-TAGNA algorithm can obtain higher rewards faster and has a higher win ratio. By analyzing agent behavior, the efficiency, superiority and rationality of resource utilization of this method are verified. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Norms have been widely proposed as a means of defining and enforcing societal constraints by using the deontic concepts of obligations, permissions and prohibitions to describe what must, may and should not be done, respectively. However, recent efforts to provide norm-enabled agent architectures that guide plan choices suffer from interfering with an agent's reasoning process, and thus limit the agent's autonomy more than is required by the norms alone. In this paper we describe an extension of the Beliefs-Desires-Intentions (BDI) architecture that enables normative reasoning used to help agents choose and customise plans taking norms into account. The paper makes three significant contributions: we provide a formal framework to represent norms compactly and to manage them; we present a formal characterisation of the normative positions induced by norms of an agent's execution within a given time period; and finally, we put forth a mechanism for plan selection and ranking taking into consideration a set of normative restrictions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

This paper is motivated by the need for devising new intelligent methods that enable efficient and scalable training of collaborative robots on a variety of tasks that foster their adaptability to new tasks and environments. Recent advances in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) provide new possibilities to realize this vision. The state-of-the-art in deep RL offers proven algorithms that enable autonomous learning and mastery of a variety of robotic manipulation tasks with minimal human intervention. However, current deep RL algorithms predominantly specialize in a narrow range of tasks, are sample inefficient, and lack sufficient stability, which hinders their adoption in real-life, industrial settings. This paper develops and tests a Hyper-Actor Soft Actor–Critic (HASAC) deep RL framework based on the notions of task modularization and transfer learning to tackle this limitation. The goal of the proposed HASAC is to enhance an agent's adaptability to new tasks by transferring the learned policies of former tasks to the new task through a ”hyper-actor”. The HASAC framework is tested on the virtual robotic manipulation benchmark, Meta-World. Numerical experiments indicate superior performance by HASAC over state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms in terms of reward value, success rate, and task completion time. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

10.1016/j.engappai.2023.106085,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,"Missions involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicle usually consist of reaching a set of regions, performing some actions in each region, and returning to a determined depot after all the regions have been successfully visited or before the fuel/battery is totally consumed. Hence, planning a route becomes an important task for many applications, especially if a team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is considered. From this team, coordination and cooperation are expected to optimize results of the mission. In this paper, a system for managing multiple cooperative Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is presented. This system divides the routing problem into two stages: initial planning and routing solving. Initial planning is a first step where the regions to be visited are grouped in multiple clusters according to a distance criterion, with each cluster being assigned to each of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. Routing solving computes the best route for every agent considering the clusters of the initial planning and a variant of the Orienteering Problem. This variant introduces the concept of shared regions, allowing an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle to visit regions from other clusters and compensating for the suboptimal region clustering of the previous stage. The Orienteering Problem with shared regions is solved using the deep learning architecture Transformer along with a deep reinforcement learning framework. This architecture is able to obtain high-quality solutions much faster than conventional optimization approaches. Extensive results and comparison with other Combinatorial Optimization algorithms, including cooperative and non-cooperative scenarios, have been performed to show the benefits of the proposed solution. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

However, when considering using BDI agents for controlling teams of multiple robots, few works explore the full potential of this approach. In this paper, we aim to integrate various BDI agent features to control a cooperative team of autonomous firefighting Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), utilizing a layered architecture that combines the Jason BDI language with the Robot Operating System (ROS). In addition, we also present a new Mission-Management (MM) library, whose internal mechanisms enable the declarative definition of various missions, such as search-fire, extinguish-fire; assist other UAV, and refill. Missions can be temporarily suspended, resumed, or even interrupted. The underlying mechanism orchestrates the missions’ execution, making it simple to navigate between them. Our contention is that this library helps the developer to further exploit an important feature of BDI agents: the balance between reactiveness and proactiveness. An evaluation scenario was developed extending our previous firefighting-UAV application with significantly more functionality, incorporating wind direction and the finite nature of both battery-power and fire-retardant. Our new agent also includes a more sophisticated agent-collaboration algorithm based on the well-established Contract Net Protocol (CNP).

The proposed system introduces a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based control architecture combining fuzzy inference, neuro-emotional learning, and distributed multi-agent coordination. At the core of the approach is a Bidirectional Fuzzy Brain Emotional Learning Prediction (BFBEL-P) model, which integrates fuzzy logic and an online adaptive neural structure to enable trajectory forecasting without pre-training or prior knowledge of the environment. From an engineering perspective, this AI model is deployed in UAV swarm navigation, where robust decision-making, predictive coordination, and obstacle avoidance are essential for target interception missions. In contrast to conventional prediction methods, such as curve fitting, nonlinear model predictive control (MPC), and deep learning-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, the BFBEL-P framework offers fast convergence, low computational cost, and high adaptability. The system incorporates multi-threaded data fusion across the swarm to achieve consensus-driven predictions and maintain situational awareness, even under sensor failures or occlusions. Simulation results show that BFBEL-P improves short-term prediction accuracy by 82.2%, reduces prediction time by 15%, and achieves a 100% tracking success rate across benchmark scenarios.

However, MAS technology is found to be lacking in some critical environments as real-time environments. An interaction-based vision of a real-time system involves the purchase of a responsibility by any entity or agent for the accomplishment of a required service under possibly hard or soft temporal conditions. This vision notably increases the complexity of these kinds of systems. The main problem in the architecture development of agents in real-time environments is with the deliberation process where it is difficult to integrate complex bounded deliberative processes for decision-making in a simple and efficient way.

All these features are embedded into a modular, cognitively-inspired framework, specifically designed for voice-based semi-guided emotional conversations in real time. The validation process involved an experiment with 64 participants interacting with six distinct VHs, each designed to provoke a different basic emotion.

The VHs successfully generated the intended emotional valence in the users, while arousal was not evoked, though it could be recognized in the VHs.

The framework improves operational safety and comprises two levels: a high-level local path planning (LPP) unit and a low-level path following (PF) unit, each consisting of a DRL agent. The LPP agent is responsible for planning a path under consideration of dynamic vessels, closing a gap in the current research landscape. In addition, the LPP agent adequately considers traffic rules and the geometry of the waterway. We thereby introduce a novel application of a spatial–temporal recurrent neural network architecture to continuous action spaces. The LPP agent outperforms a state-of-the-art artificial potential field (APF) method by increasing the minimum distance to other vessels by 65% on average. The PF agent performs low-level actuator control while accounting for shallow water influences and the environmental forces winds, waves, and currents. Compared with a proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller, the PF agent yields only 61% of the mean cross-track error (MCTE) while significantly reducing control effort (CE) in terms of the required absolute rudder angle.

However, this may not be the most efficient strategy due to reservoir heterogeneity and complexity. In this study, we propose a multi-agent physics informed reinforcement learning (MAPIRL) framework to optimize the waterflooding process. The MAPIRL approach utilizes a Markov decision process to formulate the optimization problem, where multiple RL agents are trained to interact with a reservoir simulation model and receive rewards for each action. The proposed approach uses an actor–critic RL architecture to train the agents to find the optimal strategy. The agents interact with the environment during several episodes until convergence is achieved. We evaluated the effectiveness of the MAPIRL approach based on the improvement in net present value (NPV), which reflects the economic benefits of the optimized waterflooding strategy. Then, we compared the MAPIRL approach with the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm. The comparison revealed that the MAPIRL approach outperformed the MOPSO algorithm in terms of net present value. In conclusion, the MAPIRL approach is a scientifically accurate method for optimizing waterflooding in mature oil fields, providing a more efficient and robust waterflooding strategy that reduces water consumption and associated costs while maximizing the economic benefits.

However, there are still significant drawbacks compared to traditional feedback control approaches for magnetic confinement. In this work, we address key drawbacks of the RL method; achieving higher control accuracy for desired plasma properties, reducing the steady-state error, and decreasing the required time to learn new tasks. We build on top of Degrave et al. (2022), and present algorithmic improvements to the agent architecture and training procedure. We present simulation results that show up to 65% improvement in shape accuracy, achieve substantial reduction in the long-term bias of the plasma current, and additionally reduce the training time required to learn new tasks by a factor of 3 or more.

In fusion engineering, path planning is complex, as it is linked with various interfacing systems within the RM design. Traditionally, path planning in this field is performed manually, involving step-by-step path generation and clearance measurements using CAD tools. This study aims to explore existing tools for path planning and develop a novel, a more automated approach to generating in-vessel RM paths for IVCs. The primary goals are to increase the speed of path assessments, improve task consistency, and lay the foundation for a more unified path planning process in the future. To assess path feasibility, a specific use case has been constructed as an experiment. Catia, a CAD tool, is used for manual path planning, while the game engine Unity is utilized to investigate Machine Learning (ML) methods for path planning in fusion devices. Reinforcement Learning (RL), known for its capabilities in interactive environments, is employed in Unity via ML-Agents plugin. The environment is a Vacuum-Vessel (VV) sector, where the interactive agent is a Blanket segment.

One of its main goals is to facilitate real-time Intrusion Detection, as accurate and swift responses are crucial in this field, especially if automatic abortion mechanisms are running. The formulation of this hybrid IDS combines Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) within a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to detect intrusions in dynamic computer networks. Temporal restrictions are imposed on this IDS, in order to perform real/execution time processing and assure system response predictability. Therefore, a dynamic real-time multi-agent architecture for IDS is proposed in this study, allowing the addition of predictable agents (both reactive and deliberative). In particular, two of the deliberative agents deployed in this system incorporate temporal-bounded CBR. This upgraded CBR is based on an anytime approximation, which allows the adaptation of this Artificial Intelligence paradigm to real-time requirements.

Although significant research and experimentation have driven the development of network slicing, existing architectures often fall short in intrinsic architectural intelligent security capabilities. This paper proposes an architecture-intelligent security mechanism to improve the NS solutions. We idealized a security-native architecture that deploys intelligent microservices as federated agents based on machine learning, providing intra-slice and architectural operation security for the Slicing Future Internet Infrastructures (SFI2) reference architecture. It is noteworthy that federated-learning approaches match the highly distributed modern microservice-based architectures, thus providing a unifying and scalable design choice for NS platforms addressing both service and security. Using ML-Agents and Security Agents, our approach identified Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) and intrusion attacks within the slice using generic and non-intrusive telemetry records, achieving an average accuracy of approximately 95.60% in the network slicing architecture and 99.99% for the deployed slice – intra-slice.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep learning techniques are tools of increasing importance for this, as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can provide a general solution to this problem. However, the heterogeneity of scenarios in which DRL models may be deployed is vast, making the design of universal plug-and-play models extremely difficult. Moreover, the real deployment of DRL models on the Edge, and in the IoT in particular, is limited by two factors: firstly, the computational complexity of the training procedure, and secondly, the need for a relatively long exploration phase, during which the agent proceeds by trial and error. A natural solution to both these issues is to use simulated environments by creating a Digital Twin (DT) of the environment, which can replicate physical entities in the digital domain, providing a standardized interface to the application layer. DTs allow for simulation and testing of models and services in a simulated environment, which may be hosted on more powerful Cloud servers without the need to exchange all the data generated by the real devices. In this paper, we present a novel architecture based on the emerging Web of Things (WoT) standard, which provides a DT of a smart environment and applies DRL techniques on real time data. We discuss the theoretical properties of DRL training using DTs, showcasing our system in an existing real deployment, comparing its performance with a legacy system. Our findings show that the implementation of a DT, specifically for DRL models, allows for faster convergence and finer tuning, as well as reducing the computational and communication demands on the Edge network.

Thus, this study proposed a deep reinforcement learning based multi-level dynamic reconfiguration method for urban distribution networks in a cloud-edge collaboration architecture to obtain a real-time optimal multi-level dynamic reconfiguration solution. First, the multi-level dynamic reconfiguration method was discussed, which included feeder-, transformer-, and substation-levels. Subsequently, the multi-agent system was combined with the cloud-edge collaboration architecture to build a deep reinforcement learning model for multi-level dynamic reconfiguration in an urban distribution network. The cloud-edge collaboration architecture can effectively support the multi-agent system to conduct “centralized training and decentralized execution” operation modes and improve the learning efficiency of the model. Thereafter, for a multi-agent system, this study adopted a combination of offline and online learning to endow the model with the ability to realize automatic optimization and updation of the strategy. In the offline learning phase, a Q-learning-based multi-agent conservative Q-learning (MACQL) algorithm was proposed to stabilize the learning results and reduce the risk of the next online learning phase. In the online learning phase, a multi- agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm based on policy gradients was proposed to explore the action space and update the experience pool.

First, we establish a stochastic sequential optimization problem, which is an NP-hard, that maximizes the SU's detection accuracy by the dynamic and optimal control of the energy sensing/detection threshold. It can enable SUs to select an available channel and sector without causing interference to the primary network. To address it in a distributed environment, the problem is transformed into a decentralized partially observed Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) problem. Second, in order to determine the best control for the Dec-POMDP in a practical environment without any prior knowledge of state–action transition probabilities, we develop a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-based algorithm, which is referred to as MA-DCSS. This algorithm adopts the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture. Third, we analyzed its computational complexity and showed the proposed approach's scalability by the polynomial computational complexity, in terms of the number of channels, sectors, and SUs.

When the agent's input changes owing to the drone's sensors or mission variations, significant retraining overhead is required to handle the changes in the input data pattern and the neural network architecture to accommodate the input data. These difficulties severely limit their applicability in dynamic real-world environments. In this paper, we propose an efficient DRL method that leverages the knowledge of the source agent to accelerate the training of the target agent under task variations. The proposed method consists of three phases: collecting training data for the target agent using the source agent, supervised pre-training of the target agent, and DRL-based fine-tuning.

FAST can operate either stand alone in simulation mode (off-line) by reading the measured values from data files, or on-line connected to the process plant through an OPC interface. The OPC interface allows the tool to be connected to almost any process which features a SCADA system for supervisory control. When running in online mode, each process is monitored by a software agent. In case of a fault, FAST will detect it and will indicate the faulty device to the SCADA. The SCADA can display and record the fault allowing the implementation of early countermeasures. For some faults, FAST can also automatically reconfigure the process to temporarily avoid an emergency stop. This functionality is specially useful in systems with high level of autonomy, difficult access or for which maintenance operations cannot be immediately implemented.

SCCP often involves various uncertainties such as emergency customer orders, inaccurate estimate of processing time or unpredictable machine breakdown. All these dynamic disturbance factors disturb the rhythm of the regular production and results in the reduction of productivity. How to make a robust and adaptable dynamic reactive scheduling in a computationally efficient manner and be able to assess the quality of the schedule to improve the steel production during SCCP are the key factors for iron and steel manufacturing productivity. This problem is difficult due to various processing routs selection, complicated dynamic disturbances, and combinational explosion of the optimization search space. This paper presents a novel Lagrangian relaxation neural network (LRNN) for the scheduling of SCCP by combing recurrent neural network optimization ideas for constraint handling.

Uniform exponential convergence to zero of the estimation errors is proven in the presence of communication failures, under a persistence of excitation assumption. Finally, the observer performance is evaluated in simulation, showing the merits of the proposed method and suggesting directions for future developments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

These architectures are promising in terms of their fast learning ability and low computational cost. In this paper, the objective is to establish performance–guaranteed emotional learning–inspired control (ELIC) strategies for autonomous multi–agent systems (MAS), where each agent incorporates an ELIC structure to support the consensus controller. The objective of each ELIC structure is to identify and compensate model differences between the theoretical assumptions taken into account when tuning the consensus protocol, and the real conditions encountered in the real system to be stabilized. Stability of the closed-loop MAS is demonstrated using a Lyapunov analysis. Simulation results based on the consensus task of a group of inverted pendulums demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ELIC for stabilization of nonlinear MAS. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.ifacol.2020.12.897,IFAC-PapersOnLine,"In cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC), autonomous vehicles are grouped into a string of platoon and, the main objective is to automatically adapt their speed using on-board sensors and communication with the preceding vehicle to maintain a desired inter-vehicle distance. Cruise control is achieved in the presence of parametric uncertainty in the vehicle dynamics using principles of adaptive control. This work proposes a novel combined CACC strategy for an uncertain homogeneous platoon with guaranteed parameter convergence and asymptotic string stability. A novel distributed consensus-based parameter estimator is proposed in conjunction with a model reference adaptive control (MRAC) algorithm using a direct control-gain update law. The algorithm ensures exponential parameter estimation error convergence to zero as well as asymptotic convergence of tracking-error to zero. Conventional CACC protocols require a condition of persistence of excitation (PE) for parameter convergence, which is required for better transient performance in converging to a string stable configuration. The PE condition is highly restrictive in the context of cruise control since velocity profiles which are demanded in the platoon model do not typically satisfy the PE condition. In contrast, the proposed scheme can ensure parameter convergence under a significantly milder condition, coined as collective initial excitation (C-IE). The C-IE condition is an extension of the concept of initial excitation (IE), which is recently proposed in the context of adaptive control of single agent system. Unlike IE, the C-IE condition caters to distributed estimation in the context of multi-agent systems. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first work on CACC framework, which ensures exponential convergence of parameter estimation error of each vehicle under the mild condition of C-IE, which further leads to asymptotic convergence of the entire vehicle platoon to a string stable configuration. Simulation study dictates that the proposed CACC architecture outperforms the existing CACC algorithms in terms of tracking and estimation performance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

This paper proposes an innovative approach to industrial automation, introducing validation and reprompting architectures utilizing large language model (LLM)-based autonomous control agents. The proposed agentic system-comprising of operator, validator, and reprompter agents-enables autonomous management of control tasks, adapting to unforeseen disturbances without human intervention. By utilizing validation and reprompting architectures, the framework allows agents to recover from errors and continuously improve decision-making in real-time industrial scenarios. We hypothesize that this mechanism will enhance performance and reliability across a variety of LLMs, offering a path toward fully autonomous systems capable of handling unexpected challenges, paving the way for robust, adaptive control in complex industrial environments. To demonstrate the concept's effectiveness, we created a simple case study involving a temperature control experiment embedded on a microcontroller device, validating the proposed approach. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Thus, they require mechanisms for acquiring and accepting norms, determining when norms are relevant to their case, and making decisions about norm compliance. Up until now the existing proposals on norm-autonomous agents assume that agents interact within a deterministic environment that is certainly perceived. In practise, agents interact by means of sensors and actuators under uncertainty with non-deterministic and dynamic environments. Therefore, the existing proposals are unsuitable or, even, useless to be applied when agents have a physical presence in some real-world environment. In response to this problem we have developed the n-BDI architecture. In this paper, we propose a multi-context graded BDI architecture (called n-BDI) that models norm-autonomous agents able to deal with uncertainty in dynamic environments.

However, smart grids face critical communication bottlenecks due to the ever-increasing volume of data from distributed sensors. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), specifically a type of pre-trained Foundation Model (FM) architecture suitable for time series data due to its efficiency and privacy-preserving properties. These GenAI models are distributed to agents, or data holders, empowering them to fine-tune the foundation model with their local datasets. By fine-tuning the foundation model, the updated model can produce synthetic data that mirrors real-world grid conditions. The server aggregates fine-tuned model from all agents and then generates synthetic data which considers all data collected in the grid. This synthetic data can be used to train global machine learning models for specific tasks like anomaly detection and energy optimization. Then, the trained task models are distributed to agents in the grid to leverage them. The paper highlights the advantages of GenAI for smart grid communication, including reduced communication burden, enhanced privacy through anonymized data transmission, and improved efficiency and scalability. By enabling a distributed and intelligent communication architecture, GenAI introduces a novel way for a more secure, efficient, and sustainable energy future. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.imavis.2009.02.012,Image and Vision Computing,"The major goal of the COSPAL project is to develop an artificial cognitive system architecture, with the ability to autonomously extend its capabilities. Exploratory learning is one strategy that allows an extension of competences as provided by the environment of the system. Whereas classical learning methods aim at best for a parametric generalization, i.e., concluding from a number of samples of a problem class to the problem class itself, exploration aims at applying acquired competences to a new problem class, and to apply generalization on a conceptual level, resulting in new models. Incremental or online learning is a crucial requirement to perform exploratory learning. In the COSPAL project, we mainly investigate reinforcement-type learning methods for exploratory learning, and in this paper we focus on the organization of cognitive systems for efficient operation. Learning is used over the entire system. It is organized in the form of four nested loops, where the outermost loop reflects the user-reinforcement-feedback loop, the intermediate two loops switch between different solution modes at symbolic respectively sub-symbolic level, and the innermost loop performs the acquired competences in terms of perception-action cycles. We present a system diagram which explains this process in more detail. We discuss the learning strategy in terms of learning scenarios provided by the user. This interaction between user ('teacher') and system is a major difference to classical robotics systems, where the system designer places his world model into the system. We believe that this is the key to extendable robust system behavior and successful interaction of humans and artificial cognitive systems. We furthermore address the issue of bootstrapping the system, and, in particular, the visual recognition module. We give some more in-depth details about our recognition method and how feedback from higher levels is implemented. The described system is however work in progress and no final results are available yet.

Often, this data is sourced from third parties, such as crowdsourcing platforms, to enable swift and efficient annotation collection for supervised learning. Yet, such an approach is susceptible to poisoning attacks where malicious agents deliberately insert harmful data to skew the resulting model behavior. Current countermeasures to these attacks either come at a significant cost, lack full efficacy, or are simply non-applicable. This study introduces and evaluates the potential of personalized model architectures as a defense against these threats. By comparing two top-performing personalized model architectures, User-ID and HuBi-Medium, against a standard non-personalized baseline across two NLP tasks and various simulated attack scenarios, we found that the personalized model architectures significantly outperformed the baseline. The robustness advantage increased with the rise in malicious annotations. Notably, the User-ID model excelled in safeguarding predictions for legitimate users from the influence of malicious annotations.

The task is harder when multiple languages have to be supported, and training datasets can be beneficial. This work focuses on the development of an intelligent system, an automated multilingual customer service conversational agent (chatbot) for university students, which supports both Greek and English and combines Intent Classification or Intent Extraction (IE) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) to understand the content (i.e. type of actions conveyed and respective entities) of users' messages. We focus on the development of the fundamental tasks required by a conversational agent to provide customer services in the education industry and manage requests with instant responses and increased customer satisfaction. Instead of handling IE and NER separately, as it is common in the related work, we develop a joint model that combines Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) layers and generates outputs both for IE and NER. We introduce a novel, open access dataset for customer services in education industry, the UniWay dataset, that has been used for training and evaluating our model, comprises students' questions in English and Greek about essential information related to their studies. A comparative evaluation of the proposed model versus state-of-the-art standalone and joint model solutions in UniWay and xSID datasets, results in improvement of the performance for the IE task up to 1.4% and it is on par with the state-of-the-art for the NER task.

Yet, many implementations remain monolithic, limiting interoperability and reusability. This paper introduces a semantic and modular architecture for orchestrating AI-driven DTs, designed to enable scalable integration and standardized coordination across industrial systems. The system employs a semantic API aligned with NGSI-LD, to expose industrial entities such as processes, anomalies, assets, and contextual KPIs (e.g., energy usage, CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, tool wear, product quality). AI techniques ranging from threshold adjustment to symbolic learning are encapsulated as modular agents, each performing targeted optimization tasks. These agents operate over the semantic API, which ensures consistent, interpretable interactions across modules. A Manager and a Recommender agent are defined to coordinate execution; while not yet deployed at runtime, their logic is implemented through semantic interfaces that support traceable, modular activation. The system is validated using synthetic data simulating machining, assembly, and inspection tasks. Results show measurable improvements in sustainability-related KPIs following each module's activation. More importantly, the semantic orchestration layer enables modularity, interoperability, and AI reuse.

Most tools consider a mature system, yet during transition and ramp up disturbances and inefficiency are common. The traditional methods, using centralised planning and control structures are too rigid and often resort to simple dispatch heuristics in this highly dynamic environment. Distributed systems have been proposed to leverage their self-organising and flexible traits to manage highly volatile and complex scenarios. Anarchic manufacturing, a free market based distributed planning and control system, delegates decision-making authority and autonomy to system elements at the lowest level; this system has previously been shown to manage job and flowshop style problems. The system has been adapted to use a dynamic batching mechanism, where jobs cooperate to benefit from economies of scale. The batch enables a direct economic viability assessment within the free market architecture, whether an individual machine should changeover production to another product type. This profitability assessment considers the overall system state and an agent's individual circumstance, which in turn reduces system myopia. Four experiments, including a real-world automotive case study, evaluate the anarchic manufacturing system against two centralised systems, using three different ramp-up curves. Although not always best performing against centralised systems, the anarchic manufacturing system is shown to manage transition scenarios effectively, displaying self-organising and flexible characteristics.

The main contribution of this paper is to provide researchers and practitioners with an overview of applications and applied embeddings and to motivate further research in neural agent-based production. Findings indicate that neural agents are not only deployed in diverse applications, but are also increasingly implemented in multi-agent environments or in combination with conventional methods — leveraging performances compared to benchmarks and reducing dependence on human experience.

However, with very few exceptions, most of recent research assumes static pre-defined roles during collaboration with centralised architectures devoid of runtime communication that can influence task responsibility and execution. Furthermore, from an information system standpoint, they lack the self-organisation needed to cope with today's manufacturing landscape that is characterised by product variants. Therefore, this study presents collaborative agents for manufacturing ontology (CAMO), which is an information model based on description logic that maintains a self-organising team network between collaborating human–robot multi-agent system (MAS). CAMO is implemented using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). It models popular notions of net systems and represents the agent, manufacturing, and interaction contexts that accommodate generalisability to different assemblies and agent capabilities. As a novel element, a dynamic consensus-driven collaboration based on parametric validation of semantic representations of agent capabilities via runtime dynamic communication is presented. CAMO is instantiated as agent beliefs in a framework that benefits from real-time dynamic communication with the assembly design environment and incorporates a mixed-reality environment for use by the operator. The employment of web technologies to project scalable notions of intentions via mixed reality is discussed for its novelty from a technology standpoint and as an intention projection mechanism.

It has solved problems beyond the realm of traditional, hand-crafted machine learning algorithms and captured the imagination of practitioners who are inundated with all types of data. As public awareness of the efficacy of DL increases so does the desire to make use of it. But even for highly trained professionals it can be daunting to approach the rapidly increasing body of knowledge in the field. Where does one start? How does one determine if a particular DL model is applicable to their problem? How does one train and deploy them?

Most previous exploration methods relied on complex architectures to estimate state novelty or introduced sensitive hyperparameters, resulting in instability. To mitigate these issues, we propose an efficient adaptive trajectory-constrained exploration strategy for DRL. The proposed method guides the agent's policy away from suboptimal solutions by regarding previous offline demonstrations as references. Specifically, this approach gradually expands the exploration scope of the agent and strives for optimality in a constrained optimization manner. Additionally, we introduce a novel policy-gradient-based optimization algorithm that utilizes adaptive clipped trajectory-distance rewards for both single- and multi-agent reinforcement learning. We provide a theoretical analysis of our method, including a deduction of the worst-case approximation error bounds, highlighting the validity of our approach for enhancing exploration.

These models struggle to adapt to changing conditions or transfer knowledge across different negotiation contexts, making them ineffective in dynamic environments. To address this research gap, we propose a novel negotiation model that uses deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to enable agents learn adaptable, generalizable strategies through the notion of “strategy templates”. These templates include (a) choice parameters to select tactics, (b) time parameters to control when tactics are activated, and (c) attribute-value parameters to guide acceptance and inform bidding decisions. As a result, we enable negotiation agents dynamically adapt their strategies, through pre-training on teacher strategies and refining them via online learning in diverse environments. Our agents also derive a user model to approximate partially specified user preferences, thus handling preference uncertainty more effectively. We developed a proof-of-concept prototype using an actor-critic architecture based on DRL, supplemented by stochastic search techniques for the estimation of user model and multi-objective optimization for making mutually beneficial offers. Experimental evaluations show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both individual and social-welfare utilities, demonstrating its ability to transfer experience across domains and excel in previously unseen scenarios.

In this paper, a number of computationally implemented cognitive models of spatial memory are reviewed and compared. Three categories of models are considered: symbolic models, neural network models, and models that are part of a systems-level cognitive architecture. Representative models from each category are described and compared in a number of dimensions along which simulation models can differ (level of modeling, types of representation, structural accuracy, generality and abstraction, environment complexity), including their possible mapping to the underlying neural substrate. Neural mappings are rarely explicated in the context of behaviorally validated models, but they could be useful to cognitive modeling research by providing a new approach for investigating a model's plausibility.

In such distributed scenario, the training problem can be formulated as the (regularized) optimization of a non-convex social cost function, given by the sum of local (non-convex) costs, where each agent contributes with a single error term defined with respect to its local dataset. To devise a flexible and efficient solution, we customize a recently proposed framework for non-convex optimization over networks, which hinges on a (primal) convexification–decomposition technique to handle non-convexity, and a dynamic consensus procedure to diffuse information among the agents. Several typical choices for the training criterion (e.g., squared loss, cross entropy, etc.) and regularization (e.g., ℓ<inf>2</inf> norm, sparsity inducing penalties, etc.) are included in the framework and explored along the paper. Convergence to a stationary solution of the social non-convex problem is guaranteed under mild assumptions. Additionally, we show a principled way allowing each agent to exploit a possible multi-core architecture (e.g., a local cloud) in order to parallelize its local optimization step, resulting in strategies that are both distributed (across the agents) and parallel (inside each agent) in nature.

Therefore, the ability to learn and behave in multi-agent environments is essential for any autonomous system that intends to interact with people. Due to the presence of multiple simultaneous learners in a multi-agent learning environment, the Markov assumption used for single-agent environments is not tenable, necessitating the development of new Policy Learning algorithms. Recent Actor–Critic algorithms proposed for multi-agent environments, such as Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients and Counterfactual Multi-Agent Policy Gradients, find a way to use the same mathematical framework as single agent environments by augmenting the Critic with extra information. However, this extra information can slow down the learning process and afflict the Critic with Curse of Dimensionality. To combat this, we propose a novel Deep Neural Network configuration called Deep Multi-Critic Network. This architecture works by taking a weighted sum over the outputs of multiple critic networks of varying complexity and size. The configuration was tested on data collected from a real-world multi-agent environment. The results illustrate that by using Deep Multi-Critic Network, less data is needed to reach the same level of performance as when not using the configuration. This suggests that as the configuration learns faster from less data, then the Critic may be able to learn Q-values faster, accelerating Actor training as well. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.neunet.2021.09.017,Neural Networks,"Decentralization is a central characteristic of biological motor control that allows for fast responses relying on local sensory information. In contrast, the current trend of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based approaches to motor control follows a centralized paradigm using a single, holistic controller that has to untangle the whole input information space. This motivates to ask whether decentralization as seen in biological control architectures might also be beneficial for embodied sensori-motor control systems when using DRL. To answer this question, we provide an analysis and comparison of eight control architectures for adaptive locomotion that were derived for a four-legged agent, but with their degree of decentralization varying systematically between the extremes of fully centralized and fully decentralized. Our comparison shows that learning speed is significantly enhanced in distributed architectures—while still reaching the same high performance level of centralized architectures—due to smaller search spaces and local costs providing more focused information for learning. Second, we find an increased robustness of the learning process in the decentralized cases—it is less demanding to hyperparameter selection and less prone to becoming trapped in poor local minima. Finally, when examining generalization to uneven terrains—not used during training—we find best performance for an intermediate architecture that is decentralized, but integrates only local information from both neighboring legs. Together, these findings demonstrate beneficial effects of distributing control into decentralized units and relying on local information. This appears as a promising approach towards more robust DRL and better generalization towards adaptive behavior. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.neunet.2021.11.004,Neural Networks,"Learning to interact with the environment not only empowers the agent with manipulation capability but also generates information to facilitate building of action understanding and imitation capabilities. This seems to be a strategy adopted by biological systems, in particular primates, as evidenced by the existence of mirror neurons that seem to be involved in multi-modal action understanding. How to benefit from the interaction experience of the robots to enable understanding actions and goals of other agents is still a challenging question. In this study, we propose a novel method, deep modality blending networks (DMBN), that creates a common latent space from multi-modal experience of a robot by blending multi-modal signals with a stochastic weighting mechanism. We show for the first time that deep learning, when combined with a novel modality blending scheme, can facilitate action recognition and produce structures to sustain anatomical and effect-based imitation capabilities. Our proposed system, which is based on conditional neural processes, can be conditioned on any desired sensory/motor value at any time step, and can generate a complete multi-modal trajectory consistent with the desired conditioning in one-shot by querying the network for all the sampled time points in parallel avoiding the accumulation of prediction errors. Based on simulation experiments with an arm-gripper robot and an RGB camera, we showed that DMBN could make accurate predictions about any missing modality (camera or joint angles) given the available ones outperforming recent multimodal variational autoencoder models in terms of long-horizon high-dimensional trajectory predictions. We further showed that given desired images from different perspectives, i.e. images generated by the observation of other robots placed on different sides of the table, our system could generate image and joint angle sequences that correspond to either anatomical or effect-based imitation behavior. To achieve this mirror-like behavior, our system does not perform a pixel-based template matching but rather benefits from and relies on the common latent space constructed by using both joint and image modalities, as shown by additional experiments. Moreover, we showed that mirror learning (in our system) does not only depend on visual experience and cannot be achieved without proprioceptive experience. Our experiments showed that out of ten training scenarios with different initial configurations, the proposed DMBN model could achieve mirror learning in all of the cases where the model that only uses visual information failed in half of them. Overall, the proposed DMBN architecture not only serves as a computational model for sustaining mirror neuron-like capabilities, but also stands as a powerful machine learning architecture for high-dimensional multi-modal temporal data with robust retrieval capabilities operating with partial information in one or multiple modalities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.neunet.2022.02.027,Neural Networks,"Humans learn to recognize and manipulate new objects in lifelong settings without forgetting the previously gained knowledge under non-stationary and sequential conditions. In autonomous systems, the agents also need to mitigate similar behaviour to continually learn the new object categories and adapt to new environments. In most conventional deep neural networks, this is not possible due to the problem of catastrophic forgetting, where the newly gained knowledge overwrites existing representations. Furthermore, most state-of-the-art models excel either in recognizing the objects or in grasp prediction, while both tasks use visual input. The combined architecture to tackle both tasks is very limited. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid model architecture consists of a dynamically growing dual-memory recurrent neural network (GDM) and an autoencoder to tackle object recognition and grasping simultaneously. The autoencoder network is responsible to extract a compact representation for a given object, which serves as input for the GDM learning, and is responsible to predict pixel-wise antipodal grasp configurations. The GDM part is designed to recognize the object in both instances and categories levels. We address the problem of catastrophic forgetting using the intrinsic memory replay, where the episodic memory periodically replays the neural activation trajectories in the absence of external sensory information. To extensively evaluate the proposed model in a lifelong setting, we generate a synthetic dataset due to lack of sequential 3D objects dataset. Experiment results demonstrated that the proposed model can learn both object representation and grasping simultaneously in continual learning scenarios. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.neunet.2022.06.020,Neural Networks,"Conflictual cues and unexpected changes in human real-case scenarios may be detrimental to the execution of tasks by artificial agents, thus affecting their performance. Meta-learning applied to reinforcement learning may enhance the design of control algorithms, where an outer learning system progressively adjusts the operation of an inner learning system, leading to practical benefits for the learning schema. Here, we developed a brain-inspired meta-learning framework for inhibition cognitive control that i) exploits the meta-learning principles in the neuromodulation theory proposed by Doya, ii) relies on a well-established neural architecture that contains distributed learning systems in the human brain, and iii) proposes optimization rules of meta-learning hyperparameters that mimic the dynamics of the major neurotransmitters in the brain. We tested an artificial agent in inhibiting the action command in two well-known tasks described in the literature: NoGo and Stop-Signal Paradigms. After a short learning phase, the artificial agent learned to react to the hold signal, and hence to successfully inhibit the motor command in both tasks, via the continuous adjustment of the learning hyperparameters. We found a significant increase in global accuracy, right inhibition, and a reduction in the latency time required to cancel the action process, i.e., the Stop-signal reaction time. We also performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the behavioral effects of the meta-parameters, focusing on the serotoninergic modulation of the dopamine release. We demonstrated that brain-inspired principles can be integrated into artificial agents to achieve more flexible behavior when conflictual inhibitory signals are present in the environment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

We compile a dataset of checkpoints from neural networks trained within the multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, thus potentially producing previously unseen combinations of neural network parameters. In particular, our generative model is a conditional transformer-based variational autoencoder that, when provided with random noise and a specified performance metric – in our context, returns – predicts the appropriate distribution over the parameter space to achieve the desired performance metric. Our method successfully generates parameters for a specified optimal return without further fine-tuning. We also show that the parameters generated using this approach are more constrained and less variable and, most importantly, perform on par with those trained directly under the multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. We test our method on the neural network architectures commonly employed in the most advanced state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.plrev.2019.04.009,Physics of Life Reviews,"What is the place of emotion in intelligent robots? In the past two decades, researchers have advocated for the inclusion of some emotion-related components in the general information processing architecture of autonomous agents, say, for better communication with humans, or to instill a sense of urgency to action. The framework advanced here goes beyond these approaches and proposes that emotion and motivation need to be integrated with all aspects of the architecture. Thus, cognitive-emotional integration is a key design principle. Emotion is not an “add on” that endows a robot with “feelings” (for instance, reporting or expressing its internal state). It allows the significance of percepts, plans, and actions to be an integral part of all its computations. It is hypothesized that a sophisticated artificial intelligence cannot be built from separate cognitive and emotional modules. A hypothetical test inspired by the Turing test, called the Dolores test, is proposed to test this assertion. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

10.1016/j.procs.2010.04.249,Procedia Computer Science,"We discuss some limitations of reflexive agents to motivate the need to develop cognitive agents and propose a hierarchical, layered, architecture for cognitive agents. Our examples often involve the discussion of cognitive agents in highway traffic models. A cognitive agent is an agent capable of performing cognitive acts, i.e. a sequence of the following activities: ""Perceiving"" information in the environment and provided by other agents, ""Reasoning"" about this information using existing knowledge, ""Judging"" the obtained information using existing knowledge, ""Responding"" to other cognitive agents or to the external environment, as it may be required, and ""Learning"", i.e. changing (and, hopefully augmenting) the existing knowledge if the newly acquired information allows it. We describe how computational intelligence techniques (e.g., fuzzy logic, neural networks, genetic algorithms, etc) allow mimicking to a certain extent the cognitive acts performed by human beings. The order with which the cognitive actions take place is important and so is the order with which the various computational intelligence techniques are applied. We believe that a hierarchical layered model should be defined for the generic cognitive agents in a style akin to the hierarchical OSI 7 layer model used in data communication. We outline in broad sense such a reference model. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.procs.2014.08.191,Procedia Computer Science,"This paper provides an outline of historical attempts to achieve human-like decision-making within machines. It concludes with a proposed conceptual approach of how researchers might pursue cognitive mission systems designs in the future. A number of potential success stories need to be explored in order to revise existing techniques and identify which techniques could be componentised for use in this future design. Existing cognitive systems have evolved over time, using; LISt Processing (LISP), PROLOG and Object Oriented Programming (OOP) languages. These were used to represent information using lists, scripts, frames, schemas, production rules, procedural, semantic and declarative processes. As Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques evolved, a number of frameworks emerged; such as Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD), Procedural Reasoning System (PRS), Collaborative Agent for Simulating Teamwork (CAST), Adaptive Character of Thought- Rational (ACT-R), distributed Multi-Agent Reasoning System (dMars), State, Operator And Result (SOAR) and Java Agent Compiler and Kernel (JACK). Many of these failed to gain traction because the problem-space has become more complex and existing heuristic code quickly becomes unwieldy with no guaranteed solution. Although currently heuristic systems relieve humans of routine activities, they are not able to independently reproduce intuition, insight or cognitive learning. Researchers have repetitively attempted to enhance the level of decision-making capabilities, but few have achieved success without augmented human support. Emerging frameworks continue to re-use a number of recurring themes to solve constrained problems, although most techniques cannot transform information into knowledge or wisdom. This paper highlights a number of the more successful concepts that could be used to progressively derive components to form a working cognitive decision-making model within a future mission system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

The complexity of many tasks arising in these domains makes them difficult to solve with pre-programmed agent behaviors. The agents must instead discover a solution on their own, using learning. In this paper, we present MLIMAS a framework for Machine Learning in Interactive Multi-Agent Systems. The MLIMAS is proposed to provide answers to the issues arising from integrating machine learning algorithms in interactive multi-agent systems, focusing on three questions i) what are the learning targets for agents?, (ii) how can the machine learning system be integrated into the agent architecture?, and (iii) how can agents learn interactively?. MLIMAS addresses those three questions plus supporting multi-agent systems consisting of autonomous and adaptive agents acting in real-time and noisy environments. As a result of such required capabilities, MLIMAS allows dynamic and intelligent behavior of the agents to efficiently achieve their local and coalition goals such through modeling other agents actions, and interactively taking benefits of self and others preferences in learning and achieving the agents goals. We studied the proposed framework in the Taxi Domain compared with the traditional Q-Learning algorithm without interactive share of information. Our experiments showed 2 times improvement for the average award received per agents trail rather than the traditional Q-Learning approach. In addition, we have got %80 improvement for the same number of trials of the agents to reach the passengers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

The resulting SiMA-C mental architecture solves the problem of adapting an agent's decision on the current internal state (demands from bodily needs and norms) and the external environment (affordances) and hence mediates between them.

Humans in such cases typically rely on social factors, such as individual relationships and ethical background. An artificial autonomous agent in such cases can be more useful and efficient as an actor in a human team, if its behavior is believable, i.e., similar to the naturally motivated human behavior. This similarity can be achieved in a cognitive architecture through the attribution of characters to actors and human-like reasoning in terms of ethical norms and moral schemas applied to developing individual relationships among characters. Whether the actor's behavior is sufficiently human-like and human-compatible in this sense, can be judged based on a Turing-like test that is described and analyzed here in simplistic videogame settings. The challenge for an artificial actor is to be preferred, over its human rival, as a trustworthy partner of the human participant. Additional metrics include behavioral characteristics derived from the study of cognitive architecture eBICA. The paradigm extends to other settings as well, and can be useful for evaluation of cognitive architectures that support near-human-level social emotionality. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

It is hypothesized that the second model will be more efficient in eliciting user's empathy to a virtual cobot based on this model. Here the object of study is a virtual pet: a penguin. Two models controlling the pet were compared: a reinforcement learning model (a Q-learning algorithm) and the emotional cognitive architecture eBICA (Samsonovich, 2013).

In the game, the game agent or Non-Players character can be modelled using several techniques to achieve the goal (e.g. reinforcement learning, deep neural network and Monte Carlo Tree Search). Deep neural networks and Monte Carlo Tree Search, two more sophisticated techniques in reinforcement learning algorithms, assisted the present reinforcement learning in resolving more challenging issues. However, this area has two challenges: the minimum number of data to model and generalization to different environments. Determining a minimum number of data required by the architecture to train the model is quite a cumbersome task to be applied to real-world jobs and situations since it demands substantial data to be explicitly provided and trial-and-error re-configuration. This work proposes a Data-Efficient Reinforcement Learning model by augmenting the data and implementing episodic memory. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, this research compares it to several models, such as the Deep Q-Network (DQN) with episodic memory to the same model with data augmentation and episodic memory. The model adds to the observations before being stored in the agent's memory, causing the agent to use the same logic and take the same action in comparable situations.

Two predictive models, a Decision Tree (DT) and a Deep Learning (DL) classifier, were developed and compared. The results show that the DT model is effective for short-term predictions but limited in broader applications, while the DL classifier shows potential for long-term prediction without requiring direct access to the game's AI.

10.1016/j.procs.2024.09.337,Procedia Computer Science,"Businesses heavily rely on data sourced from various channels like news articles, financial reports, and consumer reviews to drive their operations, enabling informed decision-making and identifying opportunities. However, traditional manual methods for data extraction are often time-consuming and resource-intensive, prompting the adoption of digital transformation initiatives to enhance efficiency. Yet, concerns persist regarding the sustainability of such initiatives and their alignment with the United Nations (UN)'s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This research aims to explore the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as a sustainable solution for Information Extraction (IE) and processing. The research methodology involves reviewing existing solutions for business decision-making, noting that many systems require training new machine learning models, which are resource-intensive and have significant environmental impacts. Instead, we propose a sustainable business solution using pre-existing LLMs that can work with diverse datasets. We link domain-specific datasets to tailor LLMs to company needs and employ a Multi-Agent architecture to divide tasks such as information retrieval, enrichment, and classification among specialized agents. This approach optimizes the extraction process and improves overall efficiency. Through the utilization of these technologies, businesses can optimize resource utilization, improve decision-making processes, and contribute to sustainable development goals, thereby fostering environmental responsibility within the corporate sector. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

The primary goal of this paper is to provide a Proof of Concept for the approach. Our method has demonstrated the ability to achieve Sharpe Ratio (SR) values comparable to those of classical online RRL while accelerating the training process by a factor of 24.6. This training method is model-agnostic and input-agnostic, enhancing its flexibility with complex model architectures. However, a significant limitation is the assumption that the agent's actions influence rewards but do not affect the rest of the environment. This assumption may hinder generalisation to some non-financial tasks.

Traditional approaches in both reinforcement learning (RL) and neural networks (NNs) often struggle with several critical challenges. Specifically, RL methods face difficulties in balancing conflicting objectives and quickly adapting to changing contexts, particularly in industrial applications where operational efficiency must be balanced with system maintenance. Similarly, traditional NNs lack the ability to incorporate contextual awareness, limiting their robustness and adaptability in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing several solutions. First, we introduce a context-aware balanced RL framework that integrates supervised learning principles into RL, enhancing the ability of intelligent agents to make balanced decisions that consider both external operational goals and internal ""health""metrics. Second, we propose a Context-Aware NN architecture that incorporates contextual attributes, improving the network's performance and relevance in dynamic environments. Third, we present a Self-Context-Aware NN architecture, which enhances model robustness by incorporating sample attribution analysis as a contextual attribute. Finally, we developed a context-aware digital vaccination framework for enhancing models' robustness.

10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.528,Procedia Manufacturing,"This paper presents an Intentional Architectural Framework for developing Knowledge-Intensive Service System Architectures (IAF-KISSA). This framework enables the specification and evaluation of knowledge-intensive service systems (KISS) architectures at the levels of network, performance, engagement, and activities. A chosen architecture then allows designing, developing, and adapting a KISS throughout its lifecycle. This research is motivated by the lack of service systems engineering (SSE) methods specifically created for KISS, despite their economic importance in industrialized economies. Examples of KISS include joint innovation initiatives and IT outsourcing contracts. KISS possess a number of distinctive characteristics, including: the knowledge-intensity of their processes and outputs; the inter-organizational coproduction of outputs, and the multi-stakeholder perspective that drives the evaluation of these systems’ performance. SSE aims to define and discover dynamic relationships among entities in order to plan, design, and adapt services systems to cocreate value [1,2]. SSE calls for a change in perspective in service engineering, from services as products to services as socio-technical systems where actors and resources are configured to collaboratively create value. An important challenge for the field of SSE is the creation of advanced models, methods, and tools for developing service system architectures. However, current service system architectures typically retain a functional and provider perspective on service systems operations without accounting for KISS characteristics. Using an intentional approach leads to modeling a service system in terms of agents, goals, strategies, and dependencies, thus addressing these concerns by moving from a functional to a strategic level of analysis [4]. Using an intentional approach to architecting KISS is thus ideally suited to their social and behavioral complexity. IAF-KISSA contributes a novel approach for architecting KISS, a type of service system that has hitherto been beyond the scope of SSE. Moreover, given the importance of knowledge for all types of service systems [2], IAF-KISSA could provide an innovative manner in which to architect service systems in general. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

The concept of reinforcement learning offers a suitable approach to train agents on learning control strategies, further advancing automation. While applications training directly on real-world processes are rare due to economical and safety constraints, simulations offer a way to develop and evaluate agents prior to deployment. With the rise of service-based business models, the simulation owner and the machine learning expert are likely to be different stakeholders in a joint project. Due to different requirements for both simulations and reinforcement-learning agents, the stakeholders may be reluctant or unable to grant full access to the respective software. This poses a serious impediment to the potential of the digital transformation. In this paper, a distributed architecture is proposed, which allows the remote training of reinforcement learning agents on a simulation. It is shown that this architecture allows the cooperation between two stakeholders by exposing a suitable technical interface to the simulation.

The complexity of products created in such a distributed environment often requires close collaborations among a number of design and production partners. In this paper, an agent-based system for coordinated product development and manufacture is presented. The system consists of two categories of agents. The first category consists solely of a managing agent (MA) and the second consists of many functional agents such as the manufacturability evaluation agent, resource agent, process-planning agent, scheduling agent, etc. Each agent represents a domain expert and it can be installed in an individual computer. All the agents could be dispersed in geographically different regions and communicate with one another through the Internet. With each functional agent having specific functionality, the MA is the center of the intelligent system. It assists the work of other agents and enables them to collaborate closely with one another. With such a system in place, a product life cycle can be optimized from product design to final manufacturing as all the procedures are considered comprehensively and integrally, and each procedure is performed in a way as to ease and expedite the work of other agents. An agent language, which includes many specifically defined performatives, is defined. Each agent can perform its task intelligently by interpreting the commands (performatives) from other agents.

It is very difficult for small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) to satisfy their customer with quality product in reasonable price. Large firms are spending huge amount of their budget in generating technology development. To cope with this competitive market, usually, SMEs concentrate on their core expertise and outsource some non-core items or activities. The outsourcing decision (when, what, whom) is very crucial for small-scale industries. Realizing this scenario, in this article, an automated self-adaptive multi-agent system has been proposed. The proposed system will help SMEs to take an appropriate decision to mitigate the uncertainty in supply chain. The developed system exploits the ""Outsourcing of operations"" feature by its agents to conclude the manufacturing processes faster and reduce the idle time of certain machines with less human intervention. The communication protocol for agents has been described to give an insight of their communication. It was explained how various agents like outsourcing, material planning and supplier selection will come into action at different stages and take appropriate outsourcing decisions. Therefore, this multi-agent architecture will facilitate small scale manufacturing industries to execute their manufacturing processes and complex logistics issues efficiently.

Therefore this paper reviews the relevant literature to identify the necessary components of such architectures. Depending on the control system's intention and use cases, the properties of the organizational paradigm, an adequate ontology and basic design patterns regarding the distribution and order-relationships of the system entities are to be defined conceptually. For the implementation, a role model, an interaction model, and a data model are required.

However, it is a potential trend to enhance the efficacy and safety of the disassembly of EV batteries based on human-robot collaboration (HRC) method. Because of the uncertainty of retired EV battery disassembly and the inefficiency of the existing disassembling sequence, it is difficult to be fully accomplish through HRC disassembly. The collaborative disassembly of EV batteries by humans and robots can be conceptualized as agents engaging with and learning from the environment, and modeled as a multi-agent Markov game process. This paper aims to address the challenge of HRC in the disassembly of EV batteries by recognizing the dual attributes of partial observability and non-smoothness in the suitable disassembly scenario. A partially observable multi-agent reinforcement learning environment is constructed, incorporating the structural aspects of the EV battery and the disassembly task. The framework is extended to the QMIX-HRC algorithm on the QMIX architecture (as a value-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm), specifically designed to tackle the sequence problem in human-robot collaborative disassembly of EV batteries.

Machine learning techniques are becoming increasingly used in engineering and maintenance, with reinforcement learning being one of the most promising. In this paper, we propose a gamma degradation process together with a novel maintenance model in which repairs are increasingly imperfect, i.e., the beneficial effect of system repairs decreases as more repairs are performed, reflecting the degradational behavior of real-world systems. To generate maintenance policies for this system, we developed a reinforcement-learning-based agent using a Double Deep Q-Network architecture. This agent presents two important advantages: it works without a predefined preventive threshold, and it can operate in a continuous degradation state space. Our agent learns to behave in different scenarios, showing great flexibility. In addition, we performed an analysis of how changes in the main parameters of the environment affect the maintenance policy proposed by the agent.

The system features two vision-based models—one for weather classification and one for crop identification—built on the MiT-B0 Vision Transformer architecture and optimized for low-resolution (128 × 128) image inputs. These models run on resource-constrained hardware suitable for rural deployment and support efficient, on-device processing. Weather prediction spans 11 classes (e.g., frost, lightning, rain, sandstorm), while crop classification covers 5 major crops. The system achieves an accuracy of 88 % for weather and 93 % for crops, with high F1-scores and low MAE, Kappa, and Hamming loss values. Predictions are interpreted by a rule-based agentic AI layer that triggers actions across multiple IoT actuators, such as smart irrigation, NDVI sensors, frost alarms, drones, and pest detectors. The decision engine supports both joint rule logic (e.g., activating hail protectors when hail is detected in maize fields) and fallback single-condition rules. Python-implemented case studies show seamless model–AI–IoT interaction in combined and separate scenarios.

The control architecture is validated in a robot system imitating in a goal-directed manner a grasping and placing sequence displayed by a human model.

10.1016/j.robot.2018.05.016,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,"Low-level control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has been extensively addressed by classical control techniques. However, the variable operating conditions and hostile environments faced by AUVs have driven researchers towards the formulation of adaptive control approaches. The reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm is a powerful framework which has been applied in different formulations of adaptive control strategies for AUVs. However, the limitations of RL approaches have lead towards the emergence of deep reinforcement learning which has become an attractive and promising framework for developing real adaptive control strategies to solve complex control problems for autonomous systems. However, most of the existing applications of deep RL use video images to train the decision making artificial agent but obtaining camera images only for an AUV control purpose could be costly in terms of energy consumption. Moreover, the rewards are not easily obtained directly from the video frames. In this work we develop a deep RL framework for adaptive control applications of AUVs based on an actor-critic goal-oriented deep RL architecture, which takes the available raw sensory information as input and as output the continuous control actions which are the low-level commands for the AUV's thrusters. Experiments on a real AUV demonstrate the applicability of the stated deep RL approach for an autonomous robot control problem. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.robot.2021.103731,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,"In this paper, we propose a two-stage learning framework for visual navigation in which the experience of the agent during exploration of one goal is shared to learn to navigate to other goals. We train a deep neural network for estimating the robot's position in the environment using ground truth information provided by a classical localization and mapping approach. The second simpler multi-goal Q-function learns to traverse the environment by using the provided discretized map. Transfer learning is applied to the multi-goal Q-function from a maze structure to a 2D simulator and is finally deployed in a 3D simulator where the robot uses the estimated locations from the position estimator deep network. In the experiments, we first compare different architectures to select the best deep network for location estimation, and then compare the effects of the multi-goal reinforcement learning method to traditional reinforcement learning. The results show a significant improvement when multi-goal reinforcement learning is used. Furthermore, the results of the location estimator show that a deep network can learn and generalize in different environments using camera images with high accuracy in both position and orientation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.robot.2023.104489,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,"Deep reinforcement learning, by taking advantage of neural networks, has made great strides in the continuous control of robots. However, in scenarios where multiple robots are required to collaborate with each other to accomplish a task, it is still challenging to build an efficient and scalable multi-agent control system due to increasing complexity. In this paper, we regard each unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with its manipulator as one agent, and leverage the power of multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) for the cooperative navigation and manipulation of a load. We propose solutions for addressing navigation to grasping point problem in targeted and flexible scenarios, and mainly focus on how to develop model-free policies for the UAVs without relying on a trajectory planner. To overcome the challenges of learning in scenarios with an increasing number of grasping points, we incorporate the demonstrations from an Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) algorithm into our framework to guide the policy training and adapt two novel techniques into the architecture of MADDPG. Furthermore, curriculum learning with the attention mechanism is utilized by reusing knowledge from fewer grasping points to facilitate the training of a load with more points. Our experiments were validated by a load with three, four and six grasping points respectively in Coppeliasim simulator and then transferred into the real world with Crazyflie quadrotors. Our results show that the average tracking deviations from the desirable grasping point to the final position of the UAV can be less than 10 cm in some real-world experiments. Compared with state-of-the-art model-free reinforcement learning and swarm optimization algorithms, results show that our proposed methods outperform other baselines with a reasonable success rate especially in the scenarios with more grasping points. Furthermore, the learned optimal policies enable UAVs to reach and hover over all the grasping points before manipulation without any collision. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of both targeted and flexible navigation, highlighting their respective advantages and disadvantages. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

10.1017/S0269888913000337,Knowledge Engineering Review,"Agent programming languages have often avoided the use of automated (first principles or hierarchical) planners in favour of predefined plan/recipe libraries for computational efficiency reasons. This allows for very efficient agent reasoning cycles, but limits the autonomy and flexibility of the resulting agents, oftentimes with deleterious effects on the agent's performance. Planning agents can, for instance, synthesise a new plan to achieve a goal for which no predefined recipe worked, or plan to make viable the precondition of a recipe belonging to a goal being pursued. Recent work on integrating automated planning with belief-desire-intention (BDI)-style agent architectures has yielded a number of systems and programming languages that exploit the efficiency of standard BDI reasoning, as well as the flexibility of generating new recipes at runtime.

10.1017/S0269888921000023,Knowledge Engineering Review,"We propose a fully distributed actor-critic architecture, named diffusion-distributed-Actor-critic Diff-DAC, with application to multitask reinforcement learning (MRL). During the learning process, agents communicate their value and policy parameters to their neighbours, diffusing the information across a network of agents with no need for a central station. Each agent can only access data from its local task, but aims to learn a common policy that performs well for the whole set of tasks. The architecture is scalable, since the computational and communication cost per agent depends on the number of neighbours rather than the overall number of agents. We derive Diff-DAC from duality theory and provide novel insights into the actor-critic framework, showing that it is actually an instance of the dual-Ascent method. We prove almost sure convergence of Diff-DAC to a common policy under general assumptions that hold even for deep neural network approximations. For more restrictive assumptions, we also prove that this common policy is a stationary point of an approximation of the original problem. Numerical results on multitask extensions of common continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that Diff-DAC stabilises learning and has a regularising effect that induces higher performance and better generalisation properties than previous architectures. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1017/S0269888921000035,Knowledge Engineering Review,"Designing hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithms that exhibit safe behaviour is not only vital for practical applications but also facilitates a better understanding of an agent's decisions. We tackle this problem in the options framework (Sutton, Precup & Singh, 1999), a particular way to specify temporally abstract actions which allow an agent to use sub-policies with start and end conditions. We consider a behaviour as safe that avoids regions of state space with high uncertainty in the outcomes of actions. We propose an optimization objective that learns safe options by encouraging the agent to visit states with higher behavioural consistency. The proposed objective results in a trade-off between maximizing the standard expected return and minimizing the effect of model uncertainty in the return. We propose a policy gradient algorithm to optimize the constrained objective function. We examine the quantitative and qualitative behaviours of the proposed approach in a tabular grid world, continuous-state puddle world, and three games from the Arcade Learning Environment: Ms. Pacman, Amidar, and QBert. Our approach achieves a reduction in the variance of return, boosts performance in environments with intrinsic variability in the reward structure, and compares favourably both with primitive actions and with riskneutral options. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1017/S0269888924000018,Knowledge Engineering Review,"Emerging reinforcement learning algorithms that utilize human traits as part of their conceptual architecture have been demonstrated to encourage cooperation in social dilemmas when compared to their unaltered origins. In particular, the addition of a mood mechanism facilitates more cooperative behaviour in multi-agent iterated prisoner dilemma (IPD) games, for both static and dynamic network contexts. Mood-altered agents also exhibit humanlike behavioural trends when environmental aspects of the dilemma are altered, such as the structure of the payoff matrix used. It is possible that other environmental effects from both human and agent-based research will interact with moody structures in previously unstudied ways. As the literature on these interactions is currently small, we seek to expand on previous research by introducing two more environmental dimensions; voluntary interaction in dynamic networks, and stability of interaction through varied network restructuring. From an initial Erdos-Renyi random network, we manipulate the structure of a network IPD according to existing methodology in human-based research, to investigate possible replication of their findings. We also facilitated strategic selection of opponents through the introduction of two partner evaluation mechanisms and tested two selection thresholds for each. We found that even minimally strategic play termination in dynamic networks is enough to enhance cooperation above a static level, though the thresholds for these strategic decisions are critical to desired outcomes. More forgiving thresholds lead to better maintenance of cooperation between kinder strategies than stricter ones, despite overall cooperation levels being relatively low. Additionally, moody reinforcement learning combined with certain play termination decision strategies can mimic trends in human cooperation affected by structural changes to the IPD played on dynamic networks - as can kind and simplistic strategies such as Tit-For-Tat. Implications of this in comparison with human data is discussed, and suggestions for diversification of further testing are made. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

In particular, large dialogue corpora annotated with contextual information and speech acts are urgently required. We explore how existing dialogue corpora (usually consisting of utterance transcriptions) can be automatically processed to yield new corpora where dialogue context and speech acts are accurately represented. We present a conceptual and computational framework for generating such corpora. As an example, we present and evaluate an automatic annotation system which builds 'Information State Update' (ISU) representations of dialogue context for the Communicator (2000 and 2001) corpora of human-machine dialogues (2,331 dialogues). The purposes of this annotation are to generate corpora for reinforcement learning of dialogue policies, for building user simulations, for evaluating different dialogue strategies against a baseline, and for training models for context-dependent interpretation and speech recognition. The automatic annotation system parses system and user utterances into speech acts and builds up sequences of dialogue context representations using an ISU dialogue manager. We present the architecture of the automatic annotation system and a detailed example to illustrate how the system components interact to produce the annotations. We also evaluate the annotations, with respect to the task completion metrics of the original corpus and in comparison to hand-annotated data and annotations produced by a baseline automatic system. The automatic annotations perform well and largely outperform the baseline automatic annotations in all measures.

State of the art methods in AHT are data-driven, using a large labeled dataset of prior observations to model the behavior of other agent types and to determine the ad hoc agent's behavior. These methods are computationally expensive, lack transparency, and make it difficult to adapt to previously unseen changes. Our recent work introduced an architecture that determined an ad hoc agent's behavior based on non-monotonic logical reasoning with prior commonsense domain knowledge and models learned from limited examples to predict the behavior of other agents. This paper describes KAT, a knowledge-driven architecture for AHT that substantially expands our prior architecture's capabilities to support: (a) online selection, adaptation, and learning of the behavior prediction models; and (b) collaboration with teammates in the presence of partial observability and limited communication. We illustrate and experimentally evaluate KAT's capabilities in two simulated benchmark domains for multiagent collaboration: Fort Attack and Half Field Offense. We show that KAT's performance is better than a purely knowledge-driven baseline, and comparable with or better than a state of the art data-driven baseline, particularly in the presence of limited training data, partial observability, and changes in team composition. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

This statement is based on the assumption that the ability to master natural languages is the ultimate frontier for this new paradigm and perhaps an essential step to achieving the so-called general artificial intelligence. Autonomous knowledge generation implies that a machine will be able, for instance, to retrieve and understand the contents of the scientific literature and provide interpretations for existing data, allowing it to propose and address new scientific problems. While one may assume that the continued development of AI tools exploiting large-language models, with more data used for training, may lead these systems to learn autonomously, this learning can be accelerated by devising human-assisted strategies to deal with specific tasks. For example, strategies may be implemented for AI tools to emulate the analysis of multivariate data by human experts or in identifying and explaining patterns in temporal series. In addition to generic AI tools, such as Chat AIs, one may conceive personal AI agents, potentially working together, that are likely to serve end users in the near future.

However, so far, the problem-solving abilities of many human and non-human animals are clearly superior to those of artificial systems. Here we propose steps to integrate biologically inspired hierarchical mechanisms to enable advanced problem-solving skills in artificial agents. We first review the literature in cognitive psychology to highlight the importance of compositional abstraction and predictive processing.

However, because the cloud computing centre and fog computing-enabled access points (F-APs) in the F-RAN have different computation and communication capabilities, it is crucial to make an efficient computation offloading and resource allocation strategy that can fully exploit the potential of the F-RAN system. In this paper, the authors investigate a decentralized low-complexity deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework for joint computation task offloading and resource allocation in the F-RAN, which supports assistive computing-enabled tasks offloading between F-APs. Considering the constraints of task latency, wireless transmission rate, transmission power, and computational resource capacity, the authors formulate the system processing efficiency maximization problem by jointly optimizing offloading mode selection, channel allocation, power control, and computation resource allocation in the F-RAN. To solve this non-linear and non-convex problem, the authors propose a federated DRL-based computation offloading and resource allocation algorithm to improve the task processing efficiency and ensure privacy in the system, which can significantly reduce the computing complexity and signalling overhead of the training process compared with the centralized learning-based method. Specifically, each local F-AP agent consists of dueling deep Q-network (DDQN) and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) networks to appropriately deal with discrete and continuous valuable action spaces, respectively.

10.1049/cmu2.70096,IET Communications,"The increasing demand for ultra-reliable, low-latency, and high-throughput connectivity in dense urban environments presents significant challenges for next-generation 6G networks. Traditional cellular networks, with their fixed cell boundaries and centralized base station control, are inadequate to meet the dynamic needs of such environments. A promising solution is the cell-free network architecture, where a distributed set of access points (APs) jointly serve users without fixed cell boundaries. However, efficient access point selection and accurate user localization are crucial to achieving high performance in such networks. This paper presents a decentralized approach using Belief-Desire-Intention eXtended (BDIx) agents for dynamic AP selection and localization within a cluster-based cell-free 6G communications network. Various clustering algorithms (K-means, DBSCAN, self-organizing maps, MeanShift, ClusterGAN, and Autoencoders) are evaluated for their ability to optimize network throughput, energy efficiency, and spectral utilization. A hybrid localization framework, such as centroid-based, differential circles, and multilateration methods, is employed to achieve accurate user positioning. The results demonstrate that machine learning-based clustering methods, notably Gaussian mixture model (GMM), self-organizing map (SOM), and ClusterGAN, offer significant improvements in throughput (up to 46.3%) and power reduction (up to 32.8%) over traditional methods. Regarding localization, deep learning models such as MLP, CNN, and TCN outperform deterministic methods, achieving sub-meter accuracy with minimal errors (MeanDist < 1 m, (Formula presented.) > 0.999).

Deep Q-network (DQN) is one of the more popular methods of deep reinforcement learning that allows the agent that controls the vehicle to learn through its mistakes based on its actions and interactions with the environment. This paper presents the implementation of DQN to an autonomous self-driving vehicle control in two different simulated environments; first environment is in Python which is a simple 2D environment and then advanced to Unity software separately which is a 3D environment. Based on the scores and pixel inputs, the agent in the vehicle learns and adapts to its surrounding. It develops the best solution strategy to direct itself in the environment where its task is to manoeuvre the vehicle from point to point on a simulated highway scenario. The implemented DQN technique approximates the action value function with convolutional neural network. This evaluates the Q-function for the Q-learning architecture and updates the action value function. This paper shows that DQN is an effective learning method for the agent of an autonomous vehicle.

10.1049/ntw2.70016,IET Networks,"Coping with the unprecedented surge in traffic volume necessitates a profound overhaul of traditional networking architectures. In response, software-defined networking (SDN) has emerged as a groundbreaking architecture that separates the control plane from the data plane, relocating it to a more computationally capable central controller. This paradigm shift paves the way for integrating recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) for traffic engineering and routing. This paper presents a systematic guide to implementing this integration in Java-based, open-source, open-network operating system (ONOS) SDN controllers. The control plane implementation in ONOS and data plane implementation in Mininet constitute a holistic SDN framework for evaluating the performance of RL-based traffic engineering and routing schemes. Furthermore, we implement a direct-policy transfer algorithm to enhance the RL agent's reaction time to link failures in the network topology. Considering end-to-end delay, throughput, and packet-loss ratio as our performance evaluation metrics, we compare and contrast the performance of four existing schemes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1049/sil2/9674618,IET Signal Processing,"With the rapid advancement of the Internet of Things (IoTs) and 6G technologies, traditional terrestrial networks are becoming less capable of supporting demanding computational tasks. This limitation stems from their restricted coverage and poor adaptability to changing environmental conditions. Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks offer global coverage. However, existing mobile edge computing (MEC) frameworks struggle with unstable links, high decision complexity, and limited real-time performance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a LEO satellite-enhanced MEC off-loading architecture based on improved multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL). By integrating ground terminals, LEO satellite edge servers, cloud servers into a three-tier collaborative system, and introducing an independent Q-value mechanism, the proposed method jointly optimizes task off-loading and resource allocation in dynamic environments. This design reduces algorithm complexity and enhances decision flexibility. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in end-to-end latency, energy efficiency, and convergence speed, while maintaining robust performance under varying satellite densities and user workloads. These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for efficient task off-loading in dynamic 6G scenarios. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

A new type of sharing economy is emerging with the sharing of energy resources to reduce transaction costs by using platform services in the cloud. Given the obstacles posed by the legacy system and various forms of renewable energy integration, Distributed Energy and Micro Grids (DE-MG) are an efficient means of raising the quality of energy services. Rules for microgrid scalability, maintaining a budget, and security can make this difficult.

In the proposed work, cloud-based P2P for peer-Multi Agent System (p-MAS) optimization techniques are used to reduce system peak and integrated Demand Response (DR) with Energy Management System (EMS) in a commercial MG. To fill knowledge gaps about how various power market architectures and individual decision-making processes impact local interactions and market outcomes, cloud-based P2P for Modelling Leveraging Agents (MLA) is used for bill calculation. A performance measure is finally created for cost evaluation and reliability to measure the social benefits of cloud-based P2P models for exchanging energy.

10.1055/a-2113-4443,Applied Clinical Informatics,"Background Within the CAPABLE project the authors developed a multi-agent system that relies on a distributed architecture. The system provides cancer patients with coaching advice and supports their clinicians with suitable decisions based on clinical guidelines. Objectives As in many multi-agent systems we needed to coordinate the activities of all agents involved. Moreover, since the agents share a common blackboard where all patients' data are stored, we also needed to implement a mechanism for the prompt notification of each agent upon addition of new information potentially triggering its activation. Methods The communication needs have been investigated and modeled using the HL7-FHIR (Health Level 7-Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard to ensure proper semantic interoperability among agents. Then a syntax rooted in the FHIR search framework has been defined for representing the conditions to be monitored on the system blackboard for activating each agent. Results The Case Manager (CM) has been implemented as a dedicated component playing the role of an orchestrator directing the behavior of all agents involved. Agents dynamically inform the CM about the conditions to be monitored on the blackboard, using the syntax we developed. The CM then notifies each agent whenever any condition of interest occurs. The functionalities of the CM and other actors have been validated using simulated scenarios mimicking the ones that will be faced during pilot studies and in production. Conclusion The CM proved to be a key facilitator for properly achieving the required behavior of our multi-agent system. The proposed architecture may also be leveraged in many clinical contexts for integrating separate legacy services, turning them into a consistent telemedicine framework and enabling application reusability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Because packets need to be transported from source nodes to the destination nodes as quickly and energy effectively as feasible in various application areas, packet routing is one of core difficulties in WSNs. A plethora of routing options have been suggested to tackle this problem. The proposed method distributed and designed to run on a network of interconnected routers. Different from most of its competitors, the proposed results frame the routing problem as a reinforcement learning problem with several agents. To optimize more complicated cost functions, such as the time it takes for bags to be delivered and the amount of energy used in a baggage handling system, it is possible to model every router as a deep neural network. The proposed MA-DRL attains latency of 2.41, energy consumption of 26J has superior efficiency compared to the existing methods. However, the MA-DRL has minimized latency and lower energy consumption. This way, each router may take into consideration different types of data about its surroundings.

Dynamic hybrid control architectures are a promising approach as they are not only able to switch dynamically between hierarchical, heterarchical and semi-heterarchical structures, they can also switch the level of coupling between predictive scheduling and reactive control techniques. However, few approaches address an efficient switching process in terms of structure and coupling. This paper presents a switching mechanism framework in dynamic hybrid control architectures, which exploits the advantages of hierarchical manufacturing scheduling systems and heterarchical manufacturing execution systems, and also mitigates the respective reactivity and optimality drawbacks. The main feature in this framework is that it monitors the system dynamics online and shifts between different operating modes to attain the most suitable production control strategy. The experiments were carried out in an emulation of a real manufacturing system to illustrate the benefits of including a switching mechanism in simulated scenarios. The results show that the switching mechanism improves response to disruptions in a global performance indicator as it permits to select the best alternative from several operating modes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

The effective development of these systems needs a comprehensive architecture that outlines their components and relationships. Such an architecture can pinpoint improvement areas and future outlooks. This paper presents ARTES: a general architecture illustrating how components of agent-based social training systems work together. We studied existing systems and architectures for training and tutoring to design ARTES and identify its essential components and interaction characteristics. ARTES comprises two core components: the agent simulation of social situations, and educational elements to provide guided learning. We link ARTES's crucial components to four primary learning theories (behaviourism, cognitivism, social cognitive theory, and constructivism) to illustrate the role of agent simulation and tutoring elements in establishing desired learning outcomes. Furthermore, we map ARTES's components against eight architectures, 43 systems and three tools to indicate the components' relevance, completeness, generalisation, and deployment potential across contexts. In addition to ARTES, the paper also contributes by identifying future improvements and research directions, such as the agent's thinking, tutoring methods, knowledge transfer, and ethical implications.

This paper describes ActAffAct, a bottom-up approach to constructing emotionally and dramatically believable and reusable characters for interactive drama. Emotions are central in engaging drama. The conflicts between the characters in a play and the emotions involved in resolving them are the constituents of a dramatic structure, a plot. This idea leads to the assumption that a cast of characters driven by a simulation of the process described by the appraisal theory of emotion might realize dramatic structures by simply interacting in an environment that is prone to conflict.

These agents learn models of each other in terms of expertise (ability to produce correct domain answers) and sociability (ability to produce accurate referrals). We study our framework experimentally to study how the social network evolves. Specifically, we find that under our multi-agent learning heuristic, the quality of the network improves with interactions: the quality is maximized when both expertise and sociability are considered; pivot agents further improve the quality of the network and have a catalytic effect on its quality even if they are ultimately removed. Moreover, the quality of the network improves when clustering decreases, reflecting the intuition that you need to talk to people outside your close circle to get the best information. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1088/1741-2552/ac6ca7,Journal of Neural Engineering,"Objective. In the theoretical framework of predictive coding and active inference, the brain can be viewed as instantiating a rich generative model of the world that predicts incoming sensory data while continuously updating its parameters via minimization of prediction errors. While this theory has been successfully applied to cognitive processes-by modelling the activity of functional neural networks at a mesoscopic scale-the validity of the approach when modelling neurons as an ensemble of inferring agents, in a biologically plausible architecture, remained to be explored. Approach. We modelled a simplified cerebellar circuit with individual neurons acting as Bayesian agents to simulate the classical delayed eyeblink conditioning protocol. Neurons and synapses adjusted their activity to minimize their prediction error, which was used as the network cost function. This cerebellar network was then implemented in hardware by replicating digital neuronal elements via a low-power microcontroller. Main results. Persistent changes of synaptic strength-that mirrored neurophysiological observations-emerged via local (neurocentric) prediction error minimization, leading to the expression of associative learning. The same paradigm was effectively emulated in low-power hardware showing remarkably efficient performance compared to conventional neuromorphic architectures. Significance. These findings show that: (a) an ensemble of free energy minimizing neurons-organized in a biological plausible architecture-can recapitulate functional self-organization observed in nature, such as associative plasticity, and (b) a neuromorphic network of inference units can learn unsupervised tasks without embedding predefined learning rules in the circuit, thus providing a potential avenue to a novel form of brain-inspired artificial intelligence. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

But it has been always an important issue for developing the algorithm for unstructured and unknown environments. Human-like gradual Multi-agent Q-leaming (HuMAQ) is a technique developed for autonomous robotic exploration in unknown (and even unimaginable) environments. It has been successfully implemented in multi-agent single robotic system. HuMAQ uses the concept of Subsumption architecture, a well-known Behaviour-based architecture for prioritizing the agents of the multi-agent system and executes only the most common action out of all the different actions recommended by different agents. Instead of using new state-action table (Q-table) each time, HuMAQ uses the immediate past table for efficient and faster exploration. The proof of learning has also been established both theoretically and practically. HuMAQ has the potential to be used in different and difficult situations as well as applications. The same architecture has been modified to use for multi-robot exploration in an environment. Apart from all other existing agents used in the single robotic system, agents for inter-robot communication and coordination/ co-operation with the other similar robots have been introduced in the present research.

There are many approaches and ways on modeling MAS, such as Gaia, OORam, Tropos, and MaSE. In general, the approaches usually starting from defining agents then followed by defining the attributes and roles of each agent. The problem could arise when some agents can share the same roles, because the roles should be defined on each agent. This problem can be resolved by using Role-based MAS or RoMAS approach, that emphasized on defining the role then assigning agent into the defined roles. Using this approach, we can share the role among agents and the agents could build or designed separated from the roles. On this research, we designed the conceptual model for self-healing software that will be modeled using RoMAS. The model show organization of roles that has 3 main roles which are logger, controller and executor. We also identify the breakdown for each roles and it has 3 generic roles such as getter, comparator and setter. The generic roles have responsibilities to collect data, control the system and execute the recovery plan if the system fail.

From this assumption, we develop a private list mechanism for opponent selection and gossip sharing among the population of the simulation. The results show that the private list mechanism is able to foster the emergence of cooperation, and that for various levels of list usage different levels of cooperation correspond in the system.

Deep RL integrates the two leading machine learning architectures of deep neural networks and reinforcement learning to produce robust and stable learning for control. Deep RL is ideally suited for optical systems as the tuning and control relies on interactions with its environment with a goal-oriented objective to achieve optimal immediate or delayed rewards. This allows the optical system to recognize bi-stable structures and navigate, via trajectory planning, to optimally performing solutions, the first such algorithm demonstrated to do so in optical systems. We specifically demonstrate the deep RL architecture on a mode-locked laser, where robust self-tuning and control can be established through access of the deep RL agent to its waveplates and polarizers.

10.1088/2634-4386/addc90,Neuromorphic Computing and Engineering,"Abstract Active vision enables dynamic and robust visual perception, offering an alternative to the static, passive nature of feedforward architectures commonly used in computer vision, which depend on large datasets and high computational resources. Biological selective attention mechanisms allow agents to focus on salient regions of interest (ROIs), reducing computational demand while maintaining real-time responsiveness. Event-based cameras, inspired by the mammalian retina, further enhance this capability by capturing asynchronous scene changes, enabling efficient, low-latency processing. To distinguish moving objects while the event-based camera is also in motion, the agent requires an object motion segmentation mechanism to accurately detect targets and position them at the centre of the visual field (fovea). Integrating event-based sensors with neuromorphic algorithms represents a paradigm shift, using spiking neural networks (SNNs) to parallelise computation and adapt to dynamic environments. This work presents a spiking convolutional neural network bioinspired attention system for selective attention through object motion sensitivity. The system generates events via fixational eye movements using a dynamic vision sensor integrated into the Speck neuromorphic hardware, mounted on a Pan-Tilt unit, to identify the ROI and saccade toward it. The system, characterised using ideal gratings and benchmarked against the event camera motion segmentation dataset, reaches a mean IoU of 82.2% and a mean structural similarity index of 96% in multi-object motion segmentation. Additionally, the detection of salient objects reaches an accuracy of 88.8% in office scenarios and 89.8% in challenging indoor and outdoor low-light conditions, as evaluated on the event-assisted low-light video object segmentation dataset. A real-time demonstrator showcases the system’s capabilities of detecting the salient object through object motion sensitivity in 0.124 s in dynamic scenes. Its learning-free design ensures robustness across diverse perceptual scenes, making it a reliable foundation for real-time robotic applications and serving as a basis for more complex architectures.

Results: In this article, we propose a novel multi-agent architecture for the general purpose of functional sequence motif recognition. The approach takes advantage of the synergy provided by multiple agents through the employment of different agents equipped with distinctive problem solving skills and promotes the collaborations among them through decision maker (DM) agents that work as classifier ensembles. A genetic algorithm-based fusion strategy is applied which offers evolutionary property to the DM agents. The consistency and robustness of the system are maintained by an evolvable agent that mediates the team of the ensemble agents. The combined effort of a recommendation system (Seer) and the self-learning mediator agent yields a successful identification of the most efficient agent deployment scheme at an early stage of the experimentation process, which has the potential of greatly reducing the computational cost of the system. Two concrete systems are constructed that aim at predicting two important sequence motifs-the translational initiation sites (TISs) and the core promoters. With the incorporation of three distinctive problem solver agents, the TIS predictor consistently outperforms most of the state-of-the-art approaches under investigation.

However, programming WSN applications is a complex task that requires suitable paradigms and technologies capable of supporting the specific characteristics of such networks which uniquely integrate distributed sensing, computation and communication. Mobile agents are a distributed computing paradigm based on code mobility that has already demonstrated high effectiveness and efficiency in IP-based highly dynamic distributed environments. Due to their intrinsic characteristics, mobile agents may provide more benefits in the context of WSNs than in conventional distributed environments. In this paper we present the design, implementation and experimentation of MAPS (Mobile Agent Platform for Sun SPOT), an innovative Java-based framework for wireless sensor networks based on Sun SPOT technology which enables agent-oriented programming of WSN applications. The MAPS architecture is based on components that interact through events. Each component offers a minimal set of services to mobile agents that are modeled as multi-plane state machines driven by ECA rules. In particular, the offered services include message transmission, agent creation, agent cloning, agent migration, timer handling and easy access to the sensor node resources (sensors, actuators, input switches, flash memory and battery). Agent programming with MAPS is presented through both a simple example related to mobile agent-based monitoring of a sensor node and a more complex case study for real-time human activity monitoring based on wireless body sensor networks.

Consequently, machine learning algorithms lose accuracy because they do not know these new patterns. This change in the data pattern is known as concept drift. There exist many approaches for dealing with these drifts. Usually, these methods are costly to implement because they require (i) knowledge of drift detection algorithms, (ii) software engineering strategies, and (iii) continuous maintenance concerning new drifts. Results: This article proposes to create Driftage: a new framework using multi-agent systems to simplify the implementation of concept drift detectors considerably and divide concept drift detection responsibilities between agents, enhancing explainability of each part of drift detection. As a case study, we illustrate our strategy using a muscle activity monitor of electromyography. We show a reduction in the number of false-positive drifts detected, improving detection interpretability, and enabling concept drift detectors' interactivity with other knowledge bases.

The first concerns the formation and maintenance of joint intention, which is needed to sustain the communication of knowledge between humans and robots. We describe an architecture consisting of multiple layers that enables interaction with people at different speeds. We propose the use of an affordance-based method for fast interactions. For medium-speed interactions, we propose basing control on an entrainment mechanism. For slow interactions, we propose employing defeasible interaction patterns based on probabilistic reasoning.

A key issue in delivering wireless services is the problem of congestion which has an adverse impact on the Quality of Service (QoS), especially timeliness. Although a lot of work has been done in the context of RRM (Radio Resource Management), the deliverance of quality service to the end user still remains a challenge. Therefore there is need for a system that provides real-time services to the users through high assurance. We propose an intelligent agent-based approach to guarantee a predefined Service Level Agreement (SLA) with heterogeneous user requirements for appropriate bandwidth allocation in QoS sensitive cellular networks. The proposed system architecture exploits Case Based Reasoning (CBR) technique to handle RRM process of congestion management. The system accomplishes predefined SLA through the use of Retrieval and Adaptation Algorithm based on CBR case library. The proposed intelligent agent architecture gives autonomy to Radio Network Controller (RNC) or Base Station (BS) in accepting, rejecting or buffering a connection request to manage system bandwidth. Instead of simply blocking the connection request as congestion hits the system, different buffering durations are allocated to diverse classes of users based on their SLA. This increases the opportunity of connection establishment and reduces the call blocking rate extensively in changing environment. We carry out simulation of the proposed system that verifies efficient performance for congestion handling. The results also show built-in dynamism of our system to cater for variety of SLA requirements.

The inherent combinatorial nature of layout design poses challenges for traditional planning approaches; thus, it demands the exploration of novel methods. This paper presents a novel framework that leverages the potential of deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to optimize space layouts. RL has demonstrated remarkable success in addressing complex decision-making problems, yet its application in the design process remains relatively unexplored. We argue that RL is particularly well-suited for the design process due to its ability to accommodate offline tasks and seamless integration with existing computer-aided design software, effectively acting as a simulator for design exploration. Framing space layout design as an RL problem and employing RL methods allows for the automated exploration of the expansive design space, thereby enhancing the discovery of innovative solutions. This paper also elucidates the synergy between the design process and the RL problem, which opens new avenues for exploring the potential of RL algorithms in design. We aim to foster experimentation and collaboration within the RL and architecture communities. To facilitate our research, we have developed SpaceLayoutGym, an environment specifically designed for space layout design tasks. SpaceLayoutGym serves as a customizable environment that encapsulates the essential elements of the layout design process within an RL framework. To showcase the effectiveness of SpaceLayoutGym and the capabilities of RL as an artificial space layout designer, we employ the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to train the RL agent in selected design scenarios with both geometrical constraints and topological objectives.

10.1093/jcde/qwae109,Journal of Computational Design and Engineering,"Space layout design is a fundamental yet complex problem in architecture. This task's inherent complexity, arising from the need to balance numerous geometric configurations and topological relations while adhering to specific constraints, poses significant challenges. Recent advancements in deep reinforcement learning have shown promise in addressing similar planning problems, suggesting its potential utility for innovative space layout solutions. However, a critical limitation of deep reinforcement learning is its struggle with generalizing learned strategies to unseen scenarios. In the context of architectural design, this limitation could prevent deep reinforcement learning from being a scalable design method. Pretraining has emerged as a transformative strategy within the field of artificial intelligence, especially in the realm of foundational models, to enhance the generalization capabilities of learning algorithms. While pretraining is being the central focus of this paper, our approach diverges from conventional pretraining methods that focus on pixel-level design of layouts as is in diffusion based model. Instead, we propose an architectural simulation of space layout design that could embody the multifaceted essence of architectural design. To this end, we have developed a space layout simulator called SpaceLayoutGym that serves dual purposes: first, as an environment for the reinforcement learning agent to interact with and learn the intricacies of design, and second, as a tool for generating a dataset of design scenarios and their corresponding design solutions for model pretraining. We then used imitation learning to pretrain the agent on the generated training design scenarios. This process is being followed by a fine-tuning phase by using proximal policy optimization algorithm on new design scenarios.

10.1093/logcom/exad036,Journal of Logic and Computation,"The continuous interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought, among other things, the development of several scenarios where multiple artificial entities interact with each other. As for all the other autonomous settings, these multi-agent systems require orchestration. This is, generally, achieved through techniques derived from the vast field of Automated Planning. Notably, arbitration in multi-agent domains is not only tasked with regulating how the agents act, but must also consider the interactions between the agents' information flows and must, therefore, reason on an epistemic level. This brings a substantial overhead that often diminishes the reasoning process's usability in real-world situations. To address this problem, we present ECHO, a hierarchical framework that embeds classical and multi-agent epistemic (epistemic, for brevity) planners in a single architecture. The idea is to combine (i) classical; and(ii) epistemic solvers to model efficiently the agents' interactions with the (i) 'physical world'; and(ii) information flows, respectively. In particular, the presented architecture starts by planning on the 'epistemic level', with a high level of abstraction, focusing only on the information flows. Then it refines the planning process, due to the classical planner, to fully characterize the interactions with the 'physical' world. To further optimize the solving process, we introduced the concept of macros in epistemic planning and enriched the 'classical' part of the domain with goal-networks. Finally, we evaluated our approach in an actual robotic environment showing that our architecture indeed reduces the overall computational time. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Re-enacting this Aesop's Fable task on a humanoid within an open-ended 'learning-prediction-abstraction' loop, we address this problem and (i) present a brain-guided neural framework that emulates rapid one-shot encoding of ongoing experiences into a long-term memory and (ii) propose four task-agnostic learning rules (elimination, growth, uncertainty and status quo) that correlate predictions from remembered past experiences with the unfolding present situation to gradually abstract the underlying causal relations. Driven by the proposed architecture, the ensuing robot behaviours illustrated causal learning and anticipation similar to natural agents.

In this paper are defined the different domains of knowledge required for the management of the sounds in SEs, which are modeled using ontologies. Findings: This work proposes an acoustics and sound ontology, a service-oriented architecture (SOA) ontology, and a data analytics and autonomic computing ontology, which work together.

Practical implications: In the case studies is possible to observe the flexibility that the ReM-AM middleware based on the ODA paradigm has by being aware of different contexts and acquire information of each, using this information to adapt itself to the environment and improve it using the autonomic cycles. To achieve this, the middleware integrates the classes and relations in its ontologies naturally in the autonomic cycles.

The locally trained results are aggregated by a centralized server in a privacy-preserving way. However, there is an assumption where the centralized server is trustworthy, which is impractical. Fortunately, blockchain technology has opened a new era of data exchange among trustless strangers because of its decentralized architecture and cryptography-supported techniques. Design/methodology/approach – In this study, the author proposes a novel design of a smart agent inspired by the smart contract concept. Specifically, based on the proposed smart agent, a fully decentralized, privacy-preserving and fair deep learning blockchain-FL framework is designed, where the agent network is consistent with the blockchain network and each smart agent is a participant in the FL task. During the whole training process, both the data and the model are not at the risk of leakage. Findings – A demonstration of the proposed architecture is designed to train a neural network. Finally, the implementation of the proposed architecture is conducted in the Ethereum development, showing the effectiveness and applicability of the design. Originality/value – The author aims to investigate the feasibility and practicality of linking the three areas together, namely, multi-agent system, FL and blockchain. A blockchain-FL framework, which is based on a smart agent system, has been proposed. The author has made several contributions to the state-of-the-art. First of all, a concrete design of a smart agent model is proposed, inspired by the smart contract concept in blockchain. The smart agent is autonomous and is able to disseminate, verify the information and execute the supported protocols. Based on the proposed smart agent model, a new architecture composed by these agents is formed, which is a blockchain network. Then, a fully decentralized, privacy-preserving and smart agent blockchain-FL framework has been proposed, where a smart agent acts as both a peer in a blockchain network and a participant in a FL task at the same time. Finally, a demonstration to train an artificial neural network is implemented to prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2507158,Heuristically Accelerated Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Secondary Spectrum Sharing,"This paper examines how flexible cellular system architectures and efficient spectrum management techniques can be used to play a key role in accommodating the exponentially increasing demand for mobile data capacity in the near future. The efficiency of the use of radio spectrum for wireless communications can be dramatically increased by dynamic secondary spectrum sharing; an intelligent approach that allows unlicensed devices access to those parts of the spectrum that are otherwise underutilized by the incumbent users. In this paper, we propose a heuristically accelerated reinforcement learning (HARL)-based framework, designed for dynamic secondary spectrum sharing in Long Term Evolution cellular systems. It utilizes a radio environment map as external information for guiding the learning process of cognitive cellular systems. System level simulations of a stadium temporary event scenario show that the schemes based on the proposed HARL framework achieve high controllability of spectrum sharing patterns in a fully autonomous way. This results in a significant decrease in the primary system quality of service degradation due to interference from the secondary cognitive systems, compared with a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning solution and a purely heuristic typical LTE solution. The spectrum sharing patterns that emerge by using the proposed schemes also result in remarkable reliability of the cognitive eNodeB on the aerial platform. Furthermore, the novel principle and the general structure of heuristic functions proposed in the context of HARL are applicable to a wide range of self-organization problems beyond the wireless communications domain.",

The learning architecture developed is aimed to solve complex control problems in robotic actuation control by mapping the action space from a discretized domain to a continuous one. It employs the discrete actions to construct a policy for continuous action. The architecture allows for the scaling of the dimensionality of the state space and cardinality of the action set that represents new knowledge, or new requirements for a desired task. The balance learning method utilizing the motion of robot arm and leg to shift the zero moment point on the soles of a robot can maintain the biped robot in a static stable state. This balanced algorithm is applied to biped walking on a flat surface and a seesaw and is making the biped’s walks more stable. The simulation shows that the proposed method can allow the robot to learn to improve its behavior in terms of walking speed. Finally, the methods are implemented on a physical biped robot to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed learning scheme.",

10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2592381,MAPE-K Interfaces for Formal Modeling of Real-Time Self-Adaptive Multi-Agent Systems,"Formal modeling of multi-agent systems is an active area of research. The use of precise and unambiguous notation of formal methods is used to accurately describe and reason about the system under consideration at the design time. Multi-agent systems deployed in dynamic and unpredictable environment needs to have the ability of self-adaptation, making them adaptable to the failures. State of the art encourages the use of MAPE-K feedback loop for the provision of self-adaptation in any system. There is a dire need of formal vocabulary that can be used for the conceptual design of any real-time multi-agent system with self-adaptation. In this paper, we have proposed a set of predefined interfaces for the provision of self-adaptation in real-time multi-agent systems. The interfaces are based on monitor, analyze, plan, and execute phases of the MAPE-K feedback loop. We formally specify our interfaces using timed-communicating object-Z language.

10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2745999,IEEE Access,"In this paper, we propose an autonomic network management and policy execution framework. The proposed framework refactors the network functionalities by decomposing the network architecture into hierarchical layered architecture. This paper aims at enabling the transition from a rule-based control structure to a more distributed and autonomic network control by implementing the self-x or self-∗ learning vision on each layer. The problem is modeled using multi-layer dynamic games. At each layer, a self-∗ learning procedure is proposed to learn and adapt the reverse Stackelberg policies. To validate the proposed framework, we develop a full scale demonstrator comprising of flat IP core and heterogeneous wireless access networks. We have also developed various tools and software agents to implement the self-x management vision. The proposed self-x learning is implemented via mobile intelligent agents in a distributed fashion. Our experimental results show quick re-stabilization of the self-∗ learning in mobile intelligent agents and the observed performance remain well above the satisfactory values for different key performance indicator with the proposed meta-learning approach. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

The agent-based manufacturing is a highly distributed control paradigm that can cope with these challenges well. This paper gives an overview of agent-based architectures for manufacturing systems. Besides, a cloud-assisted self-organized architecture is presented by comprising smart agents and cloud to communicate and negotiate through networks. Ontological representations of knowledge base are constructed to provide the information basis for decision-making of agents, which enables dynamic reconfiguration among agents in a collaborative way to achieve agility and flexibility. Furthermore, the agents' interaction behavior is modeled to structure the agents hierarchically to reduce the complexity, because the interactions among agents in distributed system are difficult to understand and predict. The experimental results show that the presented architecture can be easily deployed to build smart manufacturing system and can improve the adaptiveness and robustness of the manufacturing system when dealing with mixed multi-product tasks.",

In this paper, we propose a system structure composed of a central agent and three layers: unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) layer, multirobot layer and sensor network layer. The UAVs act as moving sensors and conveyors in the air. They provide the overall rough monitoring data from the air and transport robots to the emergency occurring places.

To address the problems of complexity in a critical situation, policy improvement in robotic soccer games must occur. This paper proposes an adaptive decisionmaking method that uses reinforcement learning (RL), and the decision-making system for a robotic soccer game is composed of two subsystems. The first subsystem in the architecture for the proposed method criticizes the situation, and the second subsystem implements decision-making policy. Inspired by the support vector machine (SVM), a situation classification method, which is called an improved SVM, embeds a decision tree structure and simultaneously addresses the problems of a large scale and multiple classifications. When a variety of situations that are collected in the field are classified and congregated into the tree structure, the problem of local strategy selection for each individual class of situations over time is regarded as a RL problem and is solved using a Q-learning method. The results of simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method allows satisfactory decision-making.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2847048,A Sample Aggregation Approach to Experiences Replay of Dyna-Q Learning,"In a complex environment, the learning efficiency of reinforcement learning methods always decreases due to large-scale or continuous spaces problems, which can cause the well-known curse of dimensionality. To deal with this problem and enhance learning efficiency, this paper introduces an aggregation method by using framework of sample aggregation based on Chinese restaurant process (CRP), named FSA-CRP, to cluster experiential samples, which is represented by quadruples of the current state, action, next state, and the obtained reward. In addition, the proposed algorithm applies a similarity estimation method, the MinHash method, to calculate the similarity between samples. Moreover, to improve the learning efficiency, the experience sharing Dyna learning algorithm based on samples/clusters prediction method is proposed. While an agent learns the value function of the current state, it acquires clustering results, the value functions of the sample merge with the original as the updated value function of the cluster. In indirect learning (planning) for the Dyna-Q, a learning agent looks for the most likely branches of the constructed FSA-CRP model to raise up learning efficiency. The most likely branches will be selected by an improved action/sample selection algorithm. The algorithm applies the probability that the sample appears in the cluster to select simulated experiences for indirect learning. To verify the validity and applicability of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on a simulated maze and a cart-pole system. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively accelerate the learning process.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2849821,Formal Specification and Verification of Self-Adaptive Concurrent Systems,"The assurance of required quality properties is one of the major challenges in self-adaptive systems (SASs). SASs have the capability to adapt their dynamic behavior autonomously at runtime due to uncertain changes in the environment. In general, an SAS is much difficult to specify and verify, because of its highly complex internal behavior and especially when time constraints are involved. In this research, we use modal μ-calculus (Mμ) for the specification and verification of colored Petri nets-based self-adaptive concurrent systems. We propose self-adaptive multi-agent concurrent system (SMACS) framework that is specifically designed for complex architectures. The internal structure of SMACS framework is based on MAPE-K feedback loop. Each phase of the feedback loop works as an internal agent (Int-Agent) known as Monitor Int-Agent, Analyzer Int-Agent, Planer Int-Agent, and Executer Int-Agent. The decentralized approach is being used in this research, and due to this approach, all agents intelligently adapt their behavior in the environment and send updates to other agents. For verification of internal properties like liveness, safeness, and deadlock-freedom of each agent, the TAPA model checker is being used. For the implementation of SMACS framework, traffic monitoring system is chosen as a case study.",

However, modeling methodologies and tools for autonomous objects in CPS are still lacking. In this paper, the CPS-Agent is proposed to model objects with consideration of temporal-spatial traits and interaction with physical environment. It is formulated by a fivetuple. Furthermore, considering that no universal methodology of coordination strategy formulation could be used to guide researchers, we present a role-based strategy formulation to make work patterns of CPS-Agents more clear. In terms of network communication among CPS-Agents, a set of communicative primitives is tailored based on the FIPA-ACL specification. Afterward, to guide engineers in designing systems according to their application requirements in the area of CPS, we design templates and a novel visual support tool for generating C++ files automatically corresponding to customized CPS-Agents, coordination strategies, and coordination groups. Finally, the complete development process based on our methodologies and tool is illustrated by an instance of a car team.",

For this purpose, we thoroughly investigate complex network theory and modeling methods for WoC with cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS). WoC is a new intelligent dispatching framework characterized by weak centralization, self-organization coupling, high independence, efficient coordination, and autonomous learning. Based on these characteristics and actual engineering demands, in this paper, we adopt complex network theory, parallel machine learning, and multi-agent stochastic game theory to address three basic scientific issues in WoC dispatching and control: how to build a complex network model for WoC with CPSS to stimulate new knowledge emergence; how to analyze the evolution structure stability and operation stability during this knowledge emergence process; and how to use the emerged new knowledge to achieve cell autonomy and system-wide coordination based on independent and CID, respectively. Finally, we conduct some explorations and make a prospect for WoC. The biggest innovation of this paper lies in thoroughly investigating how to fully stimulate and utilize new knowledge emergence from WoC to greatly improve its CID level of dispatching and control. This will be of great significance to the development of new-generation power system smart dispatching in the future.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2883500,New Approach for Conversational Agent Definition by Non-Programmers: A Visual Domain-Specific Language,"Intelligent tutors and conversational agents (CAs) have proven to be useful learning tools. They have potential not only as stand-alone devices but also as integrable components to enrich and complement other educational resources. For this, new authoring approaches and platforms are required. They should be accessible to non-programmers (such as most teachers) and they should be integrable into current web-based educational platforms. This paper proposes a new approach to define such agents through a visual domain-specific language based on Google Blockly (a scratch-like language). It also develops a web-based integrable authoring platform to serve as a prototype, describing the requirements and architecture. To evaluate whether this novel approach is effective, a multi-stage experiment was conducted. First, participants learned to use the prototype authoring platform through an interactive tutorial. Second, they created a CA with a specific domain model. Times and performance were measured. Finally, they answered a standardized usability questionnaire (UMUX) and a purpose-specific survey. Results show that participants were able to learn to use the domain-specific language in a short time. Moreover, the purpose-specific survey indicates that their perception of the approach (and its potential) is positive. The standardized questionnaire indicates that even in its prototype stage, its usability is satisfactory.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2890393,Collaboration of Smart IoT Devices Exemplified With Smart Cupboards,"The variety of smart things connected to Internet hampers the possibility of having a stand-alone solution for service-centric provisioning in the Internet of Things (IoT). The different features of smart objects in processing capabilities, memory, and size make it difficult for final users to learn the installation and usage of all these devices in collaboration with other IoT objects, hindering the user experience. In this context, we propose a collaboration mechanism for IoT devices based on the multi-agent systems with mobile agents. This paper illustrates the current approach with smart cupboards for potentially tracking memory losses. The user study revealed that users found working products of this approach usable, easy-to-learn and useful, and they agreed that the current approach could provide a high quality of experience not only in the specific case of service-centric IoT devices for tracking memory losses but also in other domains. The learning capability by means of this approach was showed with significant reductions of reaction times and number of errors over the first and second tests with the current approach. System response times were appropriate for both continuous rendering and presenting the classification results. The usage of RAM memory was also adequate for the common actual devices.",

First, in order to elaborate on the communication relationship, the algebraic graph theory is combined with a leader–follower architecture. Next, the modified nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode is adopted to improve the fast response characteristic of the system, and distributed control laws are constructed based on the force analysis of each AUV. Furthermore, neural networks technique is employed to approximate the uncertain dynamics and forces caused by the harsh environment of the ocean.

10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2903863,Word-Based POMDP Dialog Management via Hybrid Learning,"Dialog management plays an important role in the task-oriented dialog system. Most of the previous works divide dialog management into state tracker and action selector. The two parts are modeled separately and implemented in a pipelined way, which suffers from the problem of error accumulation, and the feedback signal from action selector cannot be propagated to state tracker and natural language understanding module. This paper proposes a word-based partially observable Markov decision processes' dialog management that integrates natural language understanding, state tracker, and action selector into an end-to-end architecture. Our proposed dialog management takes the words from user utterances as inputs and then produces optimal action as well as slot values of natural language understanding which are necessary for response generation. To this end, we propose a hybrid learning method, which integrates reinforcement learning and supervised learning, to optimize the action selector and slot filler jointly. In addition, we develop a high-return prioritized experience replay to speed up the convergence of the training process. The experimental results show that the proposed dialog management outperforms four strong baselines in a series of different dialog tasks. A human user's evaluation also shows the same results. The high-return prioritized experience replay accelerates the convergence effectively, especially in the scenario in which the proposed dialog management works on more complex tasks.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2904081,A Trust-Based Agent Learning Model for Service Composition in Mobile Cloud Computing Environments,"Mobile cloud computing has the features of resource constraints, openness, and uncertainty which leads to the high uncertainty on its quality of service (QoS) provision and serious security risks. Therefore, when faced with complex service requirements, an efficient and reliable service composition approach is extremely important. In addition, preference learning is also a key factor to improve user experiences. In order to address them, this paper introduces a three-layered trust-enabled service composition model for the mobile cloud computing systems. Based on the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, we design a novel and integrated trust management model. Service brokers are equipped with a learning module enabling them to better analyze customers’ service preferences, especially in cases when the details of a service request are not totally disclosed. Because traditional methods cannot totally reflect the autonomous collaboration between the mobile cloud entities, a prototype system based on the multi-agent platform JADE is implemented to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed strategies. The experimental results show that our approach improves the transaction success rate and user satisfaction.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2915594,Distributed Finite-Time Cooperative Control for Quadrotor Formation,"This paper investigates a finite-time formation control problem for multiple networked quadrotors. A novel distributed control approach is presented under the leader-follower formation framework, and the approach is developed based on the finite-time Lyapunov theory and the homogeneous system theory such that all quadrotors form and maintain a desired geometric pattern within finite time while tracking a reference trajectory. The designed control law is composed of a dynamic observer, a position controller and an attitude controller, in which the observer is adopted to provide estimates of the leader quadrotor information for each follower quadrotor, and the controllers are in a cascade structure. It is shown that the finite-time leader-follower formation of a group of quadrotors can be achieved via the distributed control approach, and the cascade control architecture conforms to quadrotor dynamic characteristics. The constructive procedures on how to synthesize such a control law are also given. The effectiveness of the proposed control approach is verified by the simulation.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2916314,Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Based Cooperative Content Caching for Mobile Edge Networks,"To address the drastic growth of data traffic dominated by streaming of video-on-demand files, mobile edge caching/computing (MEC) can be exploited to develop intelligent content caching at mobile network edges to alleviate redundant traffic and improve content delivery efficiency. Under the MEC architecture, content providers (CPs) can deploy popular video files at MEC servers to improve users’ quality of experience (QoE). Designing an efficient content caching policy is crucial for CPs due to the content dynamics, unknown spatial-temporal traffic demands, and limited service capacity. The knowledge of users’ preference is very useful and important for efficient content caching, yet often unavailable in advance. Under this circumstance, machine learning can be used to learn the users’ preference based on historical demand information and decide the video files to be cached at the MEC servers. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based cooperative content caching policy for the MEC architecture when the users’ preference is unknown and only the historical content demands can be observed. We formulate the cooperative content caching problem as a multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem and propose a MARL-based algorithm to solve the problem. The simulation experiments are conducted based on a real dataset from MovieLens and the numerical results show that the proposed MARL-based cooperative content caching scheme can significantly reduce content downloading latency and improve content cache hit rate when compared with other popular caching schemes.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2916470,Relational Reinforcement Learning Based Autonomous Cell Activation in Cloud-RANs,"The emergence of future 5G technologies has given cloud radio access networks (C-RANs) considerable attention. In the C-RANs, distributed remote radio heads (RRHs) are connected to centralized baseband units (BBUs) which have high capacity processors through radio links to forward radio signals from users. For the BBU pool to control energy consumption and user satisfaction levels, reinforcement learning techniques become the best option. In this paper, we propose an autonomous cell activation framework and customized physical resource allocation schemes to balance energy consumption and QoS satisfaction in wireless networks. We formulate the cell activation problem as a Markov decision process and set up a relational reinforcement learning model based on online k-means clustering and anchor-graph hashing (AGH) to satisfy the user QoS demand and to achieve low energy consumption with the minimum number of the active RRHs under varying traffic demand and user mobility. The extensive simulations are conducted to show the effectiveness of our proposed solution under a mobility scenario compared with the state-of-the-art schemes.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2923993,DDoS Traffic Control Using Transfer Learning DQN With Structure Information,"A DDoS attack is one of the most serious threats to the current Internet. The Router throttling is a popular method to response against DDoS attacks. Currently, coordinated team learning (CTL) has adopted tile coding for continuous state representation and strategy learning. It is suitable for this distributed challenge but lacks robustness. Our first contribution is that we adapt deep network as function approximation for continuous state representation, as a deep reinforcement learning approach is robust in many different Atari games with a little modification of the learning architecture. Furthermore, current multiagent router throttling methods only consider traffic-reading information. Therefore, for a homogeneous team scenario, all agents can share parameters with the same deep network. However, for heterogeneous team scenarios, if all agents still share one deep network, the learning policy may not be sufficiently ideal. Our second contribution is that we add team structure information so that all agents can still share one deep network. However, deep reinforcement learning is a considerably time-consuming task. Transfer learning is an appropriate method because learning policy in a simple scenario allows us to transfer the policy to other different and even complex scenarios. For transfer learning regarding the DDoS control problem, we propose a progressive transfer learning approach, which is our third contribution. Therefore, we can learn a better policy with less time consumption. Moreover, with progressive transfer learning, we can promote our method in a more complex environment. The experimental results validate that our three contributions truly achieve better performance than the existing methods.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2925019,A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to Proactive Content Pushing and Recommendation for Mobile Users,"The gain from proactive caching at mobile devices highly relies on the accurate prediction of user demands and mobility, which, however, is hard to achieve due to the random user behavior. In this paper, we leverage personalized content recommendation to reduce the uncertainty of user demands in sending requests. We formulate a joint content pushing and recommendation problem that maximizes the net profit of a mobile network operator. To cope with the challenges in modeling and learning user behavior, we establish a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to resolve the problem. To circumvent the curse of dimensionality of reinforcement learning for the joint problem, that is, with very large action and state spaces, we decompose the original problem into two RL problems, where two agents with different goals operate together, and we limit the number of possible actions in each state of the pushing agent by harnessing the well-learned recommendation policy. To enable the generalization of action values from experienced states to the unexperienced states with function approximation, we find a proper way to represent the state and action of the pushing agent. Then, we resort to double deep-Q network with dueling architecture to solve the two problems. The simulation results show that the learned recommendation and pushing policies are able to converge and can increase the net profit significantly compared with baseline policies.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2939493,Multimodal Human-Robot Interface for Accessible Remote Robotic Interventions in Hazardous Environments,"Human-Robot Interfaces have a key role in the design of secure and efficient robotic systems. Great effort has been put during the past decades on the design of advanced interfaces for domestic and industrial robots. However, robots for intervention in unplanned and hazardous scenarios still need further research, especially when the mission requires the use of multiple robotic systems, to obtain an acceptable level of usability and safety. This paper describes the design and the software engineering process behind the development of a modular and multimodal Human-Robot Interface for intervention with a cooperative team of robots, as well as its validation and commissioning, as it is being used in real operations at CERN's accelerators complex. The proposed Human-Robot Interface allows the control of a heterogeneous set of robots homogeneously, providing the operator, among other features, with live scripting functionalities which can be programmed and adapted in run-time, for example, to increase operator's multi-tasking in a multi-agent scenario. The operator is given the capability to enter in the control loop between the HRI and the robot and customize the control commands according to the operation. To provide such functionalities, well-defined software development approaches have been adopted, for guaranteeing the modularity and the safety of the system during its continuous development. The paper describes the modules offered by the HRI, such as the multimodality, multi-robot control, safety, operators training, and communications architecture, among others. The HRI and the CERN Robotic Framework where it belongs are designed in a modular manner, in order to be able to adapt both, software and hardware architecture in a short time, to the next planned mission. Results present the experience gained with the system, demonstrating a high level of usability, learnability and safety when operated by both, non-experts and qualified robotic operators. The multimodal user interface has demonstrated to be very accurate and secure, providing a unique system to control, in a teleoperated or supervised manner, both single and multiple heterogeneous mobile manipulators. At the moment of writing, the user interface has been successfully used in 100 real interventions in radioactive industrial environments. The presented HRI is a novel research contribution in terms of multimodality, adaptability and modularity for mobile manipulator robotic teams in radioactive environments, especially for its software architecture, as part of the CERN Robotic Framework.",

The safety production situation and the difficulty of emergency management are gradually upgraded. However, the theoretical study on the behavioral trend of complex mine production systems is still an immature field. This paper proposes the scientific problem of “theory and method of time-varying computational experiments for fully mechanized mining processes in artificial system environments”. Taking the typical fully mechanized mining process in the Yushen mining area in northern Shaanxi, China, as the research object, through computer modeling, simulation and use of multiagent system theory, APSM (Agent Publish-Subscribe Model) coordination technology, multiagent cross-emergence and multilayer learning networks, the artificial fully mechanized mining system modeling, sequential mining process deduction and state transfer theory are systematically studied. First, an artificial system model equivalent to the function of the actual fully mechanized mining system is constructed. Then, under the artificial system environment, the time-varying computational experiments of the fully mechanized mining process are realized through the autonomous deduction of the fully mechanized mining agent based on a multilayer neural network and the emergence of multiagent interactions based on subscription perception; this approach aims to solve the problem of determining the overall behavior trend of the mine under the condition of “long time and large space” and to provide intellectual support and scientific basis for the “first experiment and then produce” technological model of intelligent mining.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2965333,Intelligent Role-Based Access Control Model and Framework Using Semantic Business Roles in Multi-Domain Environments,"Today's rapidly developing communication technologies and dynamic collaborative business models made the security of data and resources more crucial than ever especially in multi-domain environments like Cloud and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). It enforced the research community to develop enhanced access control techniques and models for resources across multi-domain distributed environments so that the security requirements of all participating organizations can be fulfilled through considering dynamicity of changing environments and versatility of access control policies. The popularity of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model is irrefutable because of low administrative overhead and large-scale implementation in business organizations. However, it does not incorporate the dynamically changing policies and lacks semantically meaningful business roles which could have a diverse impact upon access decisions in multi-domain business environments. This paper describes our proposed novel access control framework that uses semantic business roles and intelligent agents through implementation of our Intelligent RBAC (I-RBAC) model. It encompasses occupational entitlements as roles for multiple domains. We use the dataset of original occupational roles provided by Standard Occupational Classification (SOC), USA. The novelty of the paper lies in developing a core I-RBAC ontology using real-world semantic business roles and intelligent agent technologies together for achieving required level of access control in highly dynamic multi-domain environment. The intelligent agents use WordNet and bidirectional LSTM deep neural network for automated population of organizational ontology from unstructured text policies. This dynamically learned organizational ontology is further matched with our core I-RBAC ontology in order to extract unified semantic business roles. The proposed I-RBAC model is mathematically described and the overall I-RBAC framework and its implementation architecture is explained. At the end, the I-RBAC model is validated through the implementation results that show a linear runtime trend of the model in presence of a large number of permission assignments and multiple queries.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2966763,On Using Composability Tools for Reliability Analysis of Unmanned Multi-Aircraft Systems: A Case Study,"This paper presents a case study that demonstrates how tools from compositional verification can be used to design and analyze complex multi-agent systems operating in dynamic and uncertain environments. The case study concerns the design of an unmanned multi-aircraft system tasked to compromise an aerial encroacher by deploying countermeasures. The constituent agents, termed defenders, are fixed-wing unmanned aircraft. To successfully compromise the encroacher, at least one defender must be within a prespecified distance from the encroacher for a certain period, and the defenders must avoid collision among themselves and with the encroacher. Verifying this global property using monolithic (system-level) verification techniques is a challenging task due to the complexity of the components (defenders) and the interactions among them. To overcome these challenges, the components are designed to have a modular architecture, thereby enabling the use of component-based reasoning to simplify the task of verifying the global system property. Results from Euclidean geometry and formal methods are used to prove most component properties. For properties where analytical tools are overly conservative, focused Monte Carlo simulations are carried out. Restricting the use of simulations (or testing) to local verification of partial component properties leads to increasing the reliability of the system.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970760,H∞ Control for Discrete-Time Multi-Player Systems via Off-Policy Q-Learning,"This paper presents a novel off-policy game Q-learning algorithm to solve H∞ control problem for discrete-time linear multi-player systems with completely unknown system dynamics. The primary contribution of this paper lies in that the Q-learning strategy employed in the proposed algorithm is implemented in an off-policy policy iteration approach other than on-policy learning, since the off-policy learning has some well-known advantages over the on-policy learning. All of players struggle together to minimize their common performance index meanwhile defeating the disturbance that tries to maximize the specific performance index, and finally they reach the Nash equilibrium of game resulting in satisfying disturbance attenuation condition. For finding the solution of the Nash equilibrium, H control problem is first transformed into an optimal control problem. Then an off-policy Q-learning algorithm is put forward in the typical adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) and game architecture, such that control policies of all players can be learned using only measured data. More importantly, the rigorous proof of no bias of solution to the Nash equilibrium by using the proposed off-policy game Q-learning algorithm is presented. Comparative simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2980544,Multi-Agent Framework for Service Restoration in Distribution Systems With Distributed Generators and Static/Mobile Energy Storage Systems,"This paper presents a multi-agent system (MAS)-based approach for service restoration in a distribution system with distributed generators (DGs), static energy storage systems (SESSs), and mobile energy storage systems (MESSs). In comparison with existing MAS-based service restoration approaches in a two-layer cyber-physical architecture, excluding the dispatch of MESSs, we propose a three-layer framework that consists of cyber, physical, and transportation layers corresponding to the communication scheme for the MAS, electric distribution system, and transportation network for MESSs, respectively. In the proposed MAS framework, agents communicate and cooperate with each other for service restoration without violating system operation constraints by conducting the following actions: i) Kruskal-algorithm-based island reconfiguration (switch agent), ii) generation of switching sequence and dispatches of DGs and SESSs (DG and static battery agents) under monitored loading condition (load agent), and iii) dispatch of MESSs based on optimal road routing using the Dijkstra algorithm (mobile battery agent). Case studies were carried out in an IEEE 33-bus distribution system, and the results validated the performance of the proposed approach in terms of number of restored loads and restoration time steps, voltage level, and state of charge of the SESSs and MESSs with different numbers of fault lines and SESSs/MESS, and different extents of damaged roads.",

Finally, typical robotics software architectures are introduced, as frameworks for efficient arrangement of the above mentioned enabling techniques.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2991435,Multi-Modal Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction for Edge Agents Based on Spatial-Temporal Graph,"Edge agents, represented by socially-aware robots and autonomous vehicles, have gradually been integrated into human society. The safety navigation system in interactive scenes is of great importance to them. The key of this system is that the edge agent has the ability to predict the pedestrian trajectory in the dynamic scene, so as to avoid collision. However, predicting pedestrian trajectories in dynamic scenes is not an easy task, because it is necessary to comprehensively consider the spatial-temporal structure of human-environment interaction, visual attention, and the multi-modal behavior of human walking. In this paper, a scalable spatial-temporal graph generation adversarial network architecture (STG-GAN) is introduced, which can comprehensively consider the influence of human-environment interaction and generate a reasonable multi-modal prediction trajectory. First, we use LSTM nodes to flexibly transform the spatial-temporal graph of human-environment interactions into feed-forward differentiable feature coding, and innovatively propose the global node to integrate scene context information. Then, we capture the relative importance of global interactions on pedestrian trajectories through scaled dot product attention, and use recurrent sequence modeling and generative adversarial network architecture for common training, so as to generate reasonable pedestrian future trajectory distributions based on rich mixed features. Experiments on public data sets show that STG-GAN is superior to previous work in terms of accuracy, reasoning speed and rationality of trajectory prediction.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2992127,A Novel On-Demand Charging Strategy Based on Swarm Reinforcement Learning in WRSNs,"The charging issue in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) is a popular research problem. With the help of wireless energy transfer technology, electrical energy can be transfer from Wireless Charging Equipment (WCE) to the sensor nodes, providing a new paradigm to prolong the network lifetime. Existing research usually takes the periodical and deterministic charging approach, but ignore the limited energy of the WCE and the influences of non-deterministic factors such as topological changes and node failures, making them unsuitable for real networks. In this study, we aim to minimize the number of dead sensor nodes while maximizing energy utilization of WCE under the limited energy of the WCE. Furthermore, the Swarm Reinforcement Learning (SRL) method is firstly introduced to achieve the autonomous planning ability of WCE. Moreover, to solve the problem of insufficient search in existing SRL algorithm, we improve the SRL by firefly algorithm. And a novel charging algorithm, named Swarm Reinforcement Learning based on Firefly Algorithm (SRL-FA), is proposed for the on-demand charging architecture. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, SRL-FA is compared with the existing swarm reinforcement learning algorithms and classic on-demand charging algorithms in two network scenarios. The Extensive simulation shows that the proposed algorithm can achieve promising performance in energy utilization of WCE, charging success rate and other performance metrics.",

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3002895,IEEE Access,"With the development of emerging applications such as augmented reality, more and more computing tasks are sensitive to delay. Caching popular task computation results on the mobile edge computing (MEC) server is an effective solution to meet the latency requirements. When multiple users request the same task, if the computation result is cached on the MEC server, it will return the computation result directly to the user to reduce the delay for repeated computation. In this paper, we use the caching to assist the calculation. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is used to further reduce the delay for computation offloading. The optimization problem is formulated as how to make caching and offloading decision to minimize the delay of whole system. In the case of unknown popularity, we use Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) algorithm to predict the task popularity in time-varying system, and place the computing results of tasks with high popularity on the corresponding server. Based on the predicted popularity, a multi-agent Deep-Q-network (MADQN) algorithm is used to solve the caching and offloading problem. The simulation results show that the prediction error of GRU algorithm can be reduced by increasing the learning rate. Meanwhile, the proposed MADQN can effectively reduce the delay compared with other methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3003894,"Trusted UAV Network Coverage Using Blockchain, Machine Learning, and Auction Mechanisms","The UAV is emerging as one of the greatest technology developments for rapid network coverage provisioning at affordable cost. The aim of this paper is to outsource network coverage of a specific area according to a desired quality of service requirement and to enable various entities in the network to have intelligence to make autonomous decisions using blockchain and auction mechanisms. In this regard, by considering a multiple-UAV network where each UAV is associated to its own controlling operator, this paper addresses two major challenges: the selection of the UAV for the desired quality of network coverage and the development of a distributed and autonomous real-time monitoring framework for the enforcement of service level agreement (SLA). For a suitable UAV selection, we employ a reputation-based auction mechanism to model the interaction between the business agent who is interested in outsourcing the network coverage and the UAV operators serving in closeby areas. In addition, theoretical analysis is performed to show that the proposed auction mechanism attains a dominant strategy equilibrium. For the SLA enforcement and trust model, we propose a permissioned blockchain architecture considering Support Vector Machine (SVM) for real-time autonomous and distributed monitoring of UAV service. In particular, smart contract features of the blockchain are invoked for enforcing the SLA terms of payment and penalty, and for quantifying the UAV service reputation. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of theoretical analysis and efficacy of the proposed model.",

Based on the above background, this paper aims to study the autonomous coordinated control strategy for the complex process of traffic information physical fusion system based on big data. In this paper, the information physical fusion system is applied to the modern transportation system, and it is used to realize the high integration of computation, communication and control.

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3012824,RoSA: A Framework for Modeling Self-Awareness in Cyber-Physical Systems,"The role of smart and autonomous systems is becoming vital in many areas of industry and society. Expectations from such systems continuously rise and become more ambitious: long lifetime, high reliability, high performance, energy efficiency, and adaptability, particularly in the presence of changing environments. Computational self-awareness promises a comprehensive assessment of the system state for sensible and well-informed actions and resource management. Computational self-awareness concepts can be used in many applications such as automated manufacturing plants, telecommunication systems, autonomous driving, traffic control, smart grids, and wearable health monitoring systems. Developing self-aware systems from scratch for each application is the most common practice currently, but this is highly redundant, inefficient, and uneconomic. Hence, we propose a framework that supports modeling and evaluation of various self-aware concepts in hierarchical agent systems, where agents are made up of self-aware functionalities. This paper presents the Research on Self-Awareness (RoSA) framework and its design principles. In addition, self-aware functionalities abstraction, data reliability, and confidence, which are currently provided by RoSA, are described. Potential use cases of RoSA are discussed. Capabilities of the proposed framework are showcased by case studies from the fields of healthcare and industrial monitoring. We believe that RoSA is capable of serving as a common framework for self-aware modeling and applications and thus helps researchers and engineers in exploring the vast design space of hierarchical agent-based systems with computational self-awareness.",

Great progress has been made in this area, but previous studies are fragmented and lack of a task-based perspective to model different systems in the real world. Therefore, this article proposes a formalistic model for HMAS from a task-based perspective. Not only the static organizational structure is designed, but also the dynamic running mechanism, including the self-adaptive mechanism and the task assignment mechanism based on the proposed holonic structure, are also discussed.

The congestions are usually caused by stochastic traffic demands, which are generally unassignable from time dimension in the real-world but are assumed to be assignable in existing DTA methods (i.e. real-time travel demands). In this paper, a distributed DTA method for preventing urban network traffic congestion caused by stochastic real-time travel demands by improving Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). A team structure, which consists of decision-makers and advisers, is designed to learn parallelly in realistic DTA tasks. To reduce the size of the solution space adaptively, the dynamic critical values advised by adviser agents are adopted as constraints for the strategy space of decision-makers (i.e. main agents). A collaborative heterogeneous-adviser mechanism is designed to avoid deviation of guidance. To enhance the adaptability of DTA to the changeable external environment, the mixed strategy concept is introduced to improve the decision-making process of main agents. The respective mapping mechanisms are designed to define adaptive learning rates to improve the sensitivity of MARL. The Sioux Falls (SF) network is established as a test platform via a Dynamic Network Loading (DNL). The effectiveness of the suggested DTA method is assessed through numerical simulations SF network. Under the influence of the scenario with stochastic real-time travel demands, the results show that the proposed method outperforms in terms of the throughput of the network and the individual average travel time among the overall network. Additionally, the ability of the proposed method in response to the external environment rapidly has also been demonstrated. Adopting the suggested method can improve the state of the art to assign stochastic real-time travel demands dynamically and to avoid potential traffic congestion fundamentally.",

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3027355,IEEE Access,"The basic cognitive architecture of our brain is still unknown. However, scientists have found evidence for existence of distinct behavioral control systems shared by humans and nonhumans. Inspired by the problem solving systems of the behavioral control in the primate brain, a hierarchical computational model is presented. We focus on the integrative performance of brain substructures, each of which is represented by a problem solver that is further modeled by a certain algorithm. Different levels of brain substructures, as well as the corresponding algorithms, are hierarchically organized both in structure and in function, including how and when higher-order solvers control lower-order ones. Different problem solvers share a same slice of working memory. This novelty is claimed since most of existing brain models emphasize on the neural network structure even though the neuron dynamics of brain is still very controversial. And we compare its performance to three other computational models in the face of a challenging foraging problem. Agents are examined in foraging environment with different sizes, and/or transparent barriers. The experimental results show that our model performed the best outright in most scenarios. Further, the results discover that the virtues of our primate brain lie not only in the heights of thinking it can reach, but also in its range and versatility. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3027463,A Systematic State-of-the-Art Analysis of Multi-Agent Intrusion Detection,"Multi-agent architectures have been successful in attaining considerable attention among computer security researchers. This is so, because of their demonstrated capabilities such as autonomy, embedded intelligence, learning and self-growing knowledge-base, high scalability, fault tolerance, and automatic parallelism. These characteristics have made this technology a de facto standard for developing ambient security systems to meet the open and dynamic nature of today's online communities. Although multi-agent architectures are increasingly studied in the area of computer security, there is still not enough empirical evidence on their performance in intrusions and attacks detection. The aim of this paper is to report the systematic literature review conducted in the context of specific research questions, to investigate multi-agent IDS architectures to highlight the issues that affect their performance in terms of detection accuracy and response time. We used pertinent keywords and terms to search and retrieve the most recent research studies, on multi-agent IDS architectures, from the major research databases and digital libraries such as SCOPUS, Springer, and IEEE Explore. The search processes resulted in a number of studies; among them, there were journal articles, book chapters, conference papers, dissertations, and theses. The obtained studies were assessed and filtered out, and finally, there were over 71 studies chosen to answer the research questions. The results of this study have shown that multi-agent architectures include several advantages that can help in the development of ambient IDS. However, it has been found that there are several issues in the current multi-agent IDS architectures that may degrade the accuracy and response time of intrusions and attacks detection. Based on our findings, the issues of multi-agent IDS architectures include limitations in the techniques, mechanisms, and schemes used for multi-agent IDS adaptation and learning, load balancing, scalability, fault-tolerance, and high communication overhead. It has also been found that new measurement metrics are required for evaluating multi-agent IDS architectures.",

These actions involve to attend to the people who have been affected by the emergency and to minimize its consequences. A Traffic Management Plan (TMP) is a set of pre-defined measures and actions designed to produce an effective and efficient use of available resources in order to deal with a specific road incident. The operational phase of a TMP involves the coordination of several independent agencies (road managers, traffic police, firemen, etc.). These agencies must provide the resources required by the TMP in the deployment of the measures and actions. In this paper, a new framework to support the TMP operational phase is presented. This framework models each agency as an intelligent agent and it uses a reverse combinatorial distributed auction as the core component of a negotiation process. The goal of this negotiation process is to obtain a common agreement on the best possible allocation of resources taking into account the role, competencies and interest of the involved agencies. The framework has been implemented in a real scenario with real data. The tests developed have demonstrated that the system is able to manage the resources in terms of the execution time and the quality of the provided solutions.",

The road forward about the operational environment is certain about the swarms of fully automated UAVs (FAUAVs), that is, urban areas. FAUAVs with self-learning and self-decision-making abilities by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy based on a set of rules, control loops and constraints using dynamic flight plans and trajectories are taking their indispensable parts within smart cities (SCs). Therefore, their integration with the SC components using real-time data analytics is urgent. This is mainly required to establish a better swarm intelligence along with a safer and optimised harmonious smart ecosystem that enables cooperative FAUAV-SC automation systems with collaborative automated intelligence engaging in the concepts of Internet of Everything (IoE) and Automation of Everything (AoE). Planning the future of cities with swarms of FAUAVs is explored in this paper to optimise the use of FAUAVs with a diverse range of applications and a contemporary methodology is proposed using a holistic framework - FAUAVinSCF equipped with various effective and efficient techniques along with a novel FAUAV routing technique customisable to the constraints of FAUAVs and urban areas. With the methodology, the components of SC and FAUAVs involving recent and impending technological advancements are moulded together to make this inevitable transformation a harmonious part of the inhabitants contributing to the cities' liveability and sustainability. The framework consists of a decentralized agent-based control architecture that monitors and controls the swarms of resource-constraint FAUAVs for their real-time requirements in optimising their urban uses. The outcomes of the methodology suggest that the constraints of FAUAVs can be mitigated significantly in urban areas and consequently, their efficacy can be increased in realising their diverse range of missions.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3053402,Modeling Method for the Coupling Relations of Microgrid Cyber-Physical Systems Driven by Hybrid Spatiotemporal Events,"The essence of the microgrid cyber-physical system (CPS) lies in the cyclical conversion of information flow and energy flow. Most of the existing coupling models are modeled with static networks and interface structures, in which the closed-loop data flow characteristic is not fully considered. It is difficult for these models to accurately describe spatiotemporal deduction processes, such as microgrid CPS attack identification, risk propagation, safety assessment, defense control, and cascading failure. To address this problem, a modeling method for the coupling relations of microgrid CPS driven by hybrid spatiotemporal events is proposed in the present work. First, according to the topological correlation and coupling logic of the microgrid CPS, the cyclical conversion mechanism of information flow and energy flow is analyzed, and a microgrid CPS architecture with multi-agents as the core is constructed. Next, the spatiotemporal evolution characteristic of the CPS is described by hybrid automata, and the task coordination mechanism of the multi-agent CPS terminal is designed. On this basis, a discrete-continuous correlation and terminal structure characteristic representation method of the CPS based on heterogeneous multi-groups are then proposed. Finally, four spatiotemporal events, namely state perception, network communication, intelligent decision-making, and action control, are defined. Considering the constraints of the temporal conversion of information flow and energy flow, a microgrid CPS coupling model is established, the effectiveness of which is verified by simulating false data injection attack (FDIA) scenarios.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3055587,Cooperation Emergence of Manufacturing Services in Cloud Manufacturing With Agent-Based Modeling and Simulating,"With the development of information and network technology, a new type of manufacturing paradigm, known as a service-oriented Cloud Manufacturing (CMfg), is emerged. In the CMfg paradigm, geographically distributed various manufacturing resources authorized by different companies are encapsulated as different manufacturing services (MSs) supported by the enabling technologies, such as cloud computing, Industrial Internet of Things, virtualization technologies, etc. MSs are provided according to the demands of manufacturing tasks (MTs) presented by various customers via the IoT (Internet of Things) in CMfg paradigm. Generally, one MS may complete one MT, but mostly one MT needs more MSs to complete it cooperatively. Furthermore, these MSs are perhaps controlled and managed by different enterprises. As an autonomous entity, each MS generally makes decision in light of its own interests, and their own interests generally have conflicts with the others' and the collective ones. To solve the conflicts through MSs' cooperation is an efficient and low-cost method to maximize both individual and collective interests. Hence, the influences of individual decision-making behaviors on cooperation are explored and discussed in CMfg paradigm. The evolutionary game theory and agent-based modeling and simulating method are employed to model and simulate individual behaviors of MSs during the process of forming the coalition for completing MTs. In addition, the learning mechanism of MSs is discussed in the decision-making process. The simulation results show that decision behaviors of MSs are positively influenced by the information transparency of the CMfg environment and the learning mechanism of MSs effects on the cooperative emergence.",

Realizing this approach in a distributed fashion is however very difficult due to the lack of global channel state available at the base stations (BSs) in the cell level. We utilize a forward-looking game to automate reconciliation for DFA in a distributed manner between cells while zero-forcing (ZF) is used at each cell to maximize the multiplexing gain. To maximize the network capacity, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) using offline centralized training is leveraged to train the BSs to master their game-theoretic reconciliation strategies. The result is a trained neural network for each BS, empowering it with rich experience of reconciliation with other BSs for converging to a network-efficient equilibrium. The online algorithm is distributed with the BSs competing as expert players to start the negotiation process using their trained actions. Simulation results show that the proposed synergized deep-learning game-theoretic algorithm outperforms significantly the DRL-only and game-theoretic only methods, and other benchmarks for multicell MIMO.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3060816,Agent-Based Optimizing Match Between Passenger Demand and Service Supply for Urban Rail Transit Network With NetLogo,"Both passenger demand and service supply are among the most important factors that determine the performance of urban rail transit system. It is not easy to find out optimal solution for the match between the passenger demand and service supply with traditional methods, due to the complexity of the combinatorial intelligent supply — demand matching problem. In order to get the comprehensively optimal matching degree, this paper transforms the multi-criteria problem into the distributed artificial intelligence optimization by using multi-agent dynamic interaction technique. On the demand side, the dynamic passenger traffic demand with agents is modelled from perspective of boundedly rational travel decision. On the supply side, the dynamic service supply of train traffic with agent is modelled. The headway time is designated as the main decision variable, for the key link between the passenger demand and service supply is the headway time in different time-of-day intervals. To make the passenger demand more closely matched with service supply in urban rail transit network system at the reasonable travel cost and operational cost, the calculation formula for matching degree is proposed, along with the distributed system architecture for agent-based matching mechanism, and the negotiation-based iterative mechanisms for balancing. The proposed methods are validated on the simulation platform NetLogo. The simulation results emphasize the importance of representing the supply side and the demand side jointly/interactively. These findings are meaningful for policies on both development of efficient capacity usage strategies of urban rail transit network and provision of high level of service for passengers.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3061890,Intelligent Autoscaling of Microservices in the Cloud for Real-Time Applications,"Cloud applications are becoming more containerized in nature. Developing a cloud application based on a microservice architecture imposes different challenges including scalability at the container level. What adds to the challenge is that cloud applications impose quality of service (QoS) requirements and have various resource demands requiring a customized scaling approach. For example, real-time applications require near real time response time as a QoS. Existing autoscaling technologies such as Kubernetes offer some customization to a set of threshold values for autoscaling. The challenge is identifying the right values for the different autoscaling parameters that will guarantee QoS in a changing dynamic environment. Advancements in machine learning and reinforcement learning (RL) provides a means for autoscaling in cloud applications with no domain knowledge. In this article, we introduce an intelligent autonomous autoscaling system for microservices autoscaling in the cloud with QoS constraints. The system consists of two modules. The first module identifies the microservice resource demand via a generic autoscaling algorithm deployed on the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). Our algorithm adapts the Kubernetes autoscaling paradigm based on the application resource requirements. The second module uses reinforcement learning agents to learn and identify the autoscaling threshold values based on the resource demand and QoS. Experimental results show an enhancement in the microservice response time up to 20% compared to the default autoscaling paradigm. In addition, the RL agents can identify the autoscaling threshold values while maintaining a response time below the QoS constraint. Our proposed work provides a customized autoscaling solution for microservices in cloud applications while adhering to QoS constraints with minimum user interaction.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3063669,TWINBOT: Autonomous Underwater Cooperative Transportation,"Underwater Inspection, Maintenance, and Repair operations are nowadays performed using Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) deployed from dynamic-positioning vessels, having high daily operational costs. During the last twenty years, the research community has been making an effort to design new Intervention Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (I-AUV), which could, in the near future, replace the ROVs, significantly decreasing these costs. Until now, the experimental work using I-AUVs has been limited to a few single-vehicle interventions, including object search and recovery, valve turning, and hot stab operations. More complex scenarios usually require the cooperation of multiple agents, i.e., the transportation of large and heavy objects. Moreover, using small, autonomous vehicles requires consideration of their limited load capacity and limited manipulation force/torque capabilities. Following the idea of multi-agent systems, in this paper we propose a possible solution: using a group of cooperating I-AUVs, thus sharing the load and optimizing the stress exerted on the manipulators. Specifically, we tackle the problem of transporting a long pipe. The presented ideas are based on a decentralized Task-Priority kinematic control algorithm adapted for the highly limited communication bandwidth available underwater. The aforementioned pipe is transported following a sequence of poses. A path-following algorithm computes the desired velocities for the robots’ end-effectors, and the on-board controllers ensure tracking of these setpoints, taking into account the geometry of the pipe and the vehicles’ limitations. The utilized algorithms and their practical implementation are discussed in detail and validated through extensive simulations and experimental trials performed in a test tank using two 8 DOF I-AUVs.",

The application of electric vehicles (EV) in the smart grid has shown a significant option to reduce carbon emission. However, due to the limited battery capacity, managing the charging and discharging process of EV as a distributed power supply is a challenging task. Moreover, the unpredictable nature of renewable energy generation, uncertainties of plug-in electric vehicles associated parameters, energy prices, and the time-varying load create new challenges for the researchers and industries to maintain a stable operation of the power system. The EV battery charging management system plays a main role in coordinating the charging and discharging mechanism to efficiently realize a secure, efficient, and reliable power system. More recently, there has been an increasing interest in data-driven approaches in EV charging modeling. Consequently, researchers are looking to deploy model-free approaches for solving the EV charging management with uncertainties. Among many existing model-free approaches, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely used for EV charging management. Unlike other machine learning approaches, the RL technique is based on maximizing the cumulative reward. This article reviews the existing literature related to the RL-based framework, objectives, and architecture for the charging coordination strategies of electric vehicles in the power systems. In addition, the review paper presents a detailed comparative analysis of the techniques used for achieving different charging coordination objectives while satisfying multiple constraints. This article also focuses on the application of RL in EV coordination for research and development of the cutting-edge optimized energy management system (EMS), which are applicable for EV charging.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3067662,Wireless Access Control in Edge-Aided Disaster Response: A Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Approach,"The communication infrastructure is most likely to be damaged after a major disaster occurred, which would lead to further chaos in the disaster stricken area. Modern rescue activities heavily rely on the wireless communications, such as safety status report, disrupted area monitoring, evacuation instruction, rescue coordination, etc. Large amount of data generated from victims, sensors and responders must be delivered and processed in a fast and reliable way, even when the normal communication infrastructure is degraded or destroyed. To this end, reconstructing the post-disaster network by deploying MDRU (Movable and Deployable Resource Unit) and relay unit at edge is a very promising solution. However, the optimal wireless access control in this heterogeneous hastily formed network is extremely challenging, due to the frequent varying environment and the lack of statistics information in advance in post-disaster scenarios. In this paper, we propose a learning based wireless access control approach for edge-aided disaster response network. More specifically, we model the wireless access control procedure as a discrete-time single agent Markov decision process, and solve the problem by exploiting deep reinforcement learning technique. By extensive simulation results, we show that the proposed mechanism significantly outperforms the baseline schemes in terms of delay and packet drop rate.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3068239,IEEE Access,"6G is anticipated to become more human-centered than 5G and should not only explore more spectrum at high-frequency bands but, more importantly, converge driving technological trends such as blockchain technologies and connected robotics. This paper focuses on the emerging field of robonomics, which studies the sociotechnical impact of blockchain technologies on social human-robot interaction and behavioral economics for the social integration of robots into human society. Advanced blockchain technologies such as oracles enable the on-chaining of blockchain-external off-chain information stemming from human users. In doing so, they leverage on human intelligence rather than machine learning only. In this paper, we investigate the widely studied trust game of behavioral economics in a blockchain context, paying close attention to the importance of developing efficient cooperation and coordination technologies. After identifying open research challenges of blockchain-enabled implementations of the trust game, we first develop a smart contract that replaces the experimenter in the middle between trustor and trustee and demonstrate experimentally that a social efficiency of up to 100% can be achieved by using deposits to enhance both trust and trustworthiness. We then present an on-chaining oracle architecture for a networked $N$ -player trust game that involves a third type of human agents called observers, who track the players' investment and reciprocity. The presence of third-party reward and penalty decisions helps raise the average normalized reciprocity above 80%, even without requiring any deposit. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that mixed logical-affective persuasive strategies for social robots improve the trustees' trustworthiness and reciprocity significantly. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3068950,Active Environmental Monitoring and Anomaly Search System for Space Habitat With Markov Decision Process and Active Sensing,"For future crewed missions that could last years with limited ground support, the environmental control and life support system (ECLSS) will likely evolve to meet new, more stringent reliability and autonomy requirements. In this work, we focus on improving the performance of the environmental monitoring and anomaly detection systems using Markov decision process and active sensing. We exploit actively moving sensors to develop a novel sensing architecture and supporting analytics, termed Active environmental Monitoring and Anomaly Search System (AMASS). We design a Dynamic Value Iteration policy to solve the path planning problem for the moving sensors in a dynamic environment. To test and validate AMASS, we developed a series of computational experiments for fire search, and we assessed the performance against three metrics: (1) anomaly detection time lag, (2) source location uncertainty, and (3) state estimation error. The results demonstrate that: AMASS provides 10~15 times better performance than the traditional fixed sensor monitoring and detection strategy; ventilation in the monitored environment affects the performance by 6~40 times for any monitoring architecture with fixed or moving sensors; the monitoring performance cannot be fully reflected in a monolithic, single metric, but should include different metrics for the timeliness and spatial resolution of the detection function.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3069975,Hindsight Goal Ranking on Replay Buffer for Sparse Reward Environment,"This paper proposes a method for prioritizing the replay experience referred to as Hindsight Goal Ranking (HGR) in overcoming the limitation of Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) that generates hindsight goals based on uniform sampling. HGR samples with higher probability on the states visited in an episode with larger temporal difference (TD) error, which is considered as a proxy measure of the amount which the RL agent can learn from an experience. The actual sampling for large TD error is performed in two steps: first, an episode is sampled from the relay buffer according to the average TD error of its experiences, and then, for the sampled episode, the hindsight goal leading to larger TD error is sampled with higher probability from future visited states. The proposed method combined with Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), an off-policy model-free actor-critic algorithm, accelerates learning significantly faster than that without any prioritization on four challenging simulated robotic manipulation tasks. The empirical results show that HGR uses samples more efficiently than previous methods across all tasks.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3070704,Adaptive Modular Reinforcement Learning for Robot Controlled in Multiple Environments,"This paper proposes an adaptive modular reinforcement learning architecture and an algorithm for robot control operating in multiple environments. Reinforcement learning autonomously acquires control rules by interacting between the agent and the controlled system. Consequently, reinforcement learning is expected to be applied to robot control where model identification is difficult. These robots are often expected to operate in multiple environments. However, existing reinforcement learning algorithms require prior knowledge of changes in the environment. In this paper, we proposed an architecture and algorithm that does not require prior knowledge of the environment. In this architecture, the policy can be acquired by increasing the number of modules based on the interaction with the controlled system. Therefore, the proposed method can be applied to robots whose dynamics change without losing the feature that the reinforcement learning algorithm does not require prior knowledge of the controlled system. Two numerical experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed method, which improved the performance by approximately 25 % when compared to the conventional methods.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3071431,A Secure Trust Method for Multi-Agent System in Smart Grids Using Blockchain,"This paper proposes a blockchain based trust management method for agents in a multi-agent system (MAS). In this work, three objectives are achieved: trust, cooperation and privacy. The trust of agents depends on the credibility of trust evaluators, which is verified using the proposed methods of trust distortion, consistency and reliability. To enhance the cooperation between agents, a tit-3-for-tat (T3FT) repeated game strategy is developed. The strategy is more forgiving than the existing tit-for-tat (TFT) strategy. It encourages cheating agents to re-establish their trust by cooperating for three consecutive rounds of play. Also, a proof-of-cooperation consensus protocol is proposed to improve agents' cooperation while creating and validating blocks. The privacy of agents is preserved in this work using the publicly verifiable secret sharing mechanism. The proposed methods are implemented using MATLAB R2018a while the MAS is simulated using Java Agent DEvelopment framework (JADE). Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed work. From the simulation results, the proposed trust method outperforms an existing fuzzy logic trust method in terms of detecting the cheating behavior of agents in the system. Besides, the proposed T3FT strategy is effective as compared to the existing tit-for-2-tat and TFT strategies in the literature. Moreover, the security analysis of the proposed method is performed. The analysis shows that the proposed work is safe from bad-mouthing and on-off trust related attacks.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3072435,Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-Based Resource Management for End-to-End Network Slicing,"To meet the explosive growth of mobile traffic, the 5G network is designed to be flexible and support multi-access edge computing (MEC), thereby improving the end-to-end quality of service (QoS). In particular, 5G network slicing, which allows a physical infrastructure to split into multiple logical networks, keeps the balance of network resource allocation among different service types with on-demand resource requests. However, achieving effective resource allocation across the end-to-end network is difficult due to the dynamic characteristics of slicing requests such as uncertain real-time resource demand and heterogeneous requirements. In this paper, we develop a reinforcement learning (RL)-based dynamic resource allocation framework for end-to-end network slicing with heterogeneous requirements in multi-layer MEC environments. We first design a hierarchical MEC architecture and formulate a resource allocation problem for the end-to-end network slicing as an optimization problem using the Markov decision process (MDP). Using proximal policy optimization (PPO), we develop independently-collaborative and jointly-collaborative dynamic resource allocation algorithms to maximize resource efficiency while satisfying the QoS of slices. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms can recognize the characteristics of slice requests and coming resource demands and efficiently allocate resources with a high QoS satisfaction rate.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3074962,Decentralized Edge-to-Cloud Load Balancing: Service Placement for the Internet of Things,"The Internet of Things (IoT) requires a new processing paradigm that inherits the scalability of the cloud while minimizing network latency using resources closer to the network edge. On the one hand, building up such flexibility within the edge-to-cloud continuum consisting of a distributed networked ecosystem of heterogeneous computing resources is challenging. On the other hand, IoT traffic dynamics and the rising demand for low-latency services foster the need for minimizing the response time and a balanced service placement. Load-balancing for fog computing becomes a cornerstone for cost-effective system management and operations. This paper studies two optimization objectives and formulates a decentralized load-balancing problem for IoT service placement: (global) IoT workload balance and (local) quality of service (QoS), in terms of minimizing the cost of deadline violation, service deployment, and unhosted services. The proposed solution, EPOS Fog, introduces a decentralized multi-agent system for collective learning that utilizes edge-to-cloud nodes to jointly balance the input workload across the network and minimize the costs involved in service execution. The agents locally generate possible assignments of requests to resources and then cooperatively select an assignment such that their combination maximizes edge utilization while minimizes service execution cost. Extensive experimental evaluation with realistic Google cluster workloads on various networks demonstrates the superior performance of EPOS Fog in terms of workload balance and QoS, compared to approaches such as First Fit and exclusively Cloud-based. The results confirm that EPOS Fog reduces service execution delay up to 25% and the load-balance of network nodes up to 90%. The findings also demonstrate how distributed computational resources on the edge can be utilized more cost-effectively by harvesting collective intelligence.",

The resulting distributed optimal power flow algorithm reduces the computational complexity of the conventional linear programming approach while avoiding the challenges associated with the stochastic nature of the energy resources and loads. It does so using machine learning algorithms employed for two crucial tasks. First, two proposed algorithms, Dynamic Distributed Multi-Microgrid and Monte Carlo Tree Search based Reinforcement Learning, constitute dynamic microgrids of network nodes to confirm the electric power transaction optimality. Second, the optimal distributed energy resources are obtained by the proposed deep reinforcement learning method named Multi Leader-Follower Actors under Centralized Critic. It accelerates conventional linear programming approach by considering a reduced set of resources and their constraints. The proposed method is demonstrated through a real-time balancing electricity market constructed over the IEEE 123-bus system and enhanced using price signals based on distribution locational marginal prices. This application clearly shows the ability of the new approach to effectively coordinate multiple distribution system entities while maintaining system security constraints.",

We consider tasks that are spatially distributed, non-atomic, and provide an utility for integral and also partial task completion. Agents are heterogeneous, therefore showing different efficiency when dealing with the tasks. The goal is to define a system-level plan that assigns tasks to agents to maximize mission performance. We define the mission planning problem through a model including multiple sub-problems that are addressed jointly: task selection and allocation, task scheduling, task routing, control of agent proximity over time. The problem is proven to be NP-hard and is formalized as a mixed integer linear program (MILP). Two solution approaches are proposed: one heuristic and one exact method. Both combine a generic MILP solver and a genetic algorithm, resulting in efficient anytime algorithms. To support performance scalability and to allow the effective use of the model when online continual replanning is required, a decentralized and fully distributed architecture is defined top-down from the MILP model. Decentralization drastically reduces computational requirements and shows good scalability at the expenses of only moderate losses in performance. Lastly, we illustrate the application of the mission planning framework in two demonstrators. These implementations show how the framework can be successfully integrated with different platforms, including mobile robots (ground and aerial), wearable computers, and smart-phone devices.",

Agents in the system represent traders performing buy and sell orders in a market, and fuzzy systems are used to model the rules followed by traders performing trades in a live market and intuitionistic fuzzy logic to model their decisions' indeterminacy. We use functions to restrict the agents' decisions, which make the agents become specialized at particular market conditions. These “specialization” functions use the grades of membership obtained from an agent's fuzzy system and thresholds obtained from training data sets, to determine if that agent is specialized enough to handle a market's current conditions. We have performed experiments and compared against the state of the art. Results demonstrate that our method obtains predictive errors (using mean absolute error) that are in the same order of magnitude than those errors obtained by models generated using deep learning and models generated by random forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and support-vector machines. Furthermore, we performed experiments that show that identifying specialized agents yields better results.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3079838,Trait Based Trustworthiness Assessment in Human-Agent Collaboration Using Multi-Layer Fuzzy Inference Approach,"Trust is an essential requirement for effective Human-Agent interaction as artificial agents are becoming part of human society in a social context. To blend into our society and maximize their acceptability and reliability, artificial agents need to adapt to the complexity of their surroundings, like humans. This adaptation should come through knowing whom to trust by evaluating the trustworthiness of its human mate. It is therefore required to build cognitive agents with trust models that may allow them to trust humans the same way a human trusts other humans keeping under consideration all factors influencing the human agent trust mechanism. Several antecedents within the cognitive system itself and the surroundings dynamically influence the trust mechanism. Personality, as a trusted antecedent has been found to have a substantial impact in predicting human interactor’s trustworthiness that critically assists trust decision making. Current research, therefore, aims to infuse characteristics of respective humans as the antecedent of the human agent trust process. This is accomplished by incorporating into the trust model the agent’s capability to perceive the personality traits of the human interactor. The current work is focused on introducing a trustworthiness assessment model (TAMFIS) based on fuzzy inference to assess human’s trustworthiness towards artificial agents by exploring the human’s personality traits that predict trustworthiness. The artificial agent could develop its character towards its human collaborators that will help it in effective interactions. The testing of the proposed architecture is carried out using Dempster Shafer Theory of belief and estimation. It is anticipated that the proposed trust model will effectively evaluate the trustworthiness of human collaborators and develop a more reliable human–agent trust relationship.",

Despite the large body of research works already reported, current key technological challenges include those of multi-agent learning and long-term autonomy. Towards this direction, a novel cognitive architecture for multi-agent LfD robotic learning is introduced in this paper, targeting to enable the reliable deployment of open, scalable and expandable robotic systems in large-scale and complex environments. In particular, the designed architecture capitalizes on the recent advances in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) (and especially the Deep Learning (DL)) field, by establishing a Federated Learning (FL)-based framework for incarnating a multi-human multi-robot collaborative learning environment. The fundamental conceptualization relies on employing multiple AI-empowered cognitive processes (implementing various robotic tasks) that operate at the edge nodes of a network of robotic platforms, while global AI models (underpinning the aforementioned robotic tasks) are collectively created and shared among the network, by elegantly combining information from a large number of human-robot interaction instances. Regarding pivotal novelties, the designed cognitive architecture a) introduces a new FL-based formalism that extends the conventional LfD learning paradigm to support large-scale multi-agent operational settings, b) elaborates previous FL-based self-learning robotic schemes so as to incorporate the human in the learning loop and c) consolidates the fundamental principles of FL with additional sophisticated AI-enabled learning methodologies for modelling the multi-level inter-dependencies among the robotic tasks. The applicability of the proposed framework is explained using an example of a real-world industrial case study (subject to ongoing research activities) for agile production-based Critical Raw Materials (CRM) recovery.",

It is very challenging and devices overwhelming to directly apply RL to real-world environments. Due to the reality gap simulated environment does not match perfectly to the real-world scenario and additional learning cannot be performed. Therefore, an efficient approach is required for RL to find an optimal control policy and get better learning efficacy. In this paper, we propose federated reinforcement learning based on multi agent environment which applying a new federation policy. The new federation policy allows multi agents to perform learning and share their learning experiences with each other e.g., gradient and model parameters to increase their learning level. The Actor-Critic PPO algorithm is used with four types of RL simulation environments, OpenAI Gym's CartPole, MoutainCar, Acrobot, and Pendulum. In addition, we did real experiments with multiple Rotary Inverted Pendulum (RIP) to evaluate and compare the learning efficiency of the proposed scheme with both environments.",

The proposed COMORL scheme controls BOs for CRE to maximize the number of user equipments (UEs) that satisfy their quality of service (QoS) requirements, especially in terms of delay and data rates. For this purpose, we developed a QoS satisfaction indicator that measures a violation of delay requirements by considering both QoS requirements and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). In addition, we formulated a Markov decision process (MDP) model that is solved with a cooperative multi-agent online reinforcement learning algorithm. The proposed COMORL scheme maximizes the global utility for load-coupled base stations. Our simulation results verify the proposed COMORL scheme’s effectiveness in terms of throughput, delay satisfaction ratio, and fairness. Specifically, we verify that the proposed COMORL scheme achieves a maximum of approximately 27% and 30% improvement of the delay satisfaction ratio, which is how many UEs satisfy their delay requirement among all of the UEs in a serving BS under medium and full traffic loads, respectively, in a dynamic scenario in comparison to the max-SINR scheme.",

One of the most important developments is the expansion of the communication infrastructure that brings many advantages in the cyber layer of the system. The actual execution of the peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is one core advantage which also may lead to the systematic risks such as cyber-attacks. Consequently, it is necessary to form a useful way to cover such challenges. This paper focuses on the online detection of false data injection attack (FDIA), which tries to disrupt the trend of optimal peer-to-peer energy trading in the stochastic condition. Moreover, this article proposes an effective modified Intelligent Priority Selection based Reinforcement Learning (IPS-RL) method to detect and stop the malicious attacks in the shortest time for effective energy trading based on the peer to peer structure. The presented method is compared with other methods such as support vector machine (SVM), reinforcement learning (RL), particle swarm optimization (PSO)-RL, and genetic algorithm (GA)-RL to validate the functionality of the method. The proposed method is implemented and examined on three interconnected microgrids in the form of peer-to-peer structure wherein each microgrid has various agents such as photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine, fuel cell, tidal system, storage unit, etc. Eventually, the unscented transformation (UT) is applied for uncertainty analysis and making the near-reality simulations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3107325,Fuzzy Logic and Accelerated Reinforcement Learning-Based User Association for Dense C-RANs,"Cloud radio access network (C-RAN) is a potential mobile network architecture providing seamless connectivity to users with high data rates by integrating it with the small-cell technology of 5G mobile communication systems. In C-RAN, base station functionality is divided into a baseband unit (BBU) and remote radio head (RRH); the BBUs from multiple sites are centralized and virtualized using cloud computing and virtualization techniques. Frequent handovers occur in the network, which results in control message flooding and repeated service outages because of the dense deployment of short-range RRHs and user mobility. It is necessary to optimize handover control parameters before the handover and re-associate the user with an RRH to minimize unnecessary handovers in the network. Traditional handover schemes rely on signal strengths of RRHs, which cause a large number of unnecessary handovers when a user moves within the coverage of multiple-overlapped RRHs. This study investigates the handover in C-RAN by carefully optimizing the handover control parameter and selecting the target RRH for handover. Our main goal is associating the user with an RRH such that association after the handover remains possible for as long as possible while maintaining the quality of service (QoS) requirements of the users. We have used fuzzy logic to optimize the handover control parameter and a reinforcement learning-based algorithm to select the target RRH. A key component of the proposed RL-based scheme is using an acceleration technique for the faster convergence of the algorithm. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the number of handovers while ensuring QoS requirements.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115711,Implementation of Decentralized Reinforcement Learning-Based Multi-Quadrotor Flocking,"Enabling coordinated motion of multiple quadrotors is an active area of research in the field of small unmanned aerial vehicles (sUAVs). While there are many techniques found in the literature that address the problem, these studies are limited to simulation results and seldom account for wind disturbances. This paper presents the experimental validation of a decentralized planner based on multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL) that achieves waypoint-based flocking (separation, velocity alignment, and cohesion) for multiple quadrotors in the presence of wind gusts. The planner is learned using an object-focused, greatest mass, state-action-reward-state-action (OF-GM-SARSA) approach. The Dryden wind gust model is used to simulate wind gusts during hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) tests. The hardware and software architecture developed for the multi-quadrotor flocking controller is described in detail. HWIL and outdoor flight tests results show that the trained RL planner can generalize the flocking behaviors learned in training to the real-world flight dynamics of the DJI M100 quadrotor in windy conditions.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3126311,Spiking Neural Network Discovers Energy-Efficient Hexapod Motion in Deep Reinforcement Learning,"In Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for robotics application, it is important to find energy-efficient motions. For this purpose, a standard method is to set an action penalty in the reward to find the optimal motion considering the energy expenditure. This method is widely used for the simplicity of implementation. However, since the reward is a linear sum, if the penalty is too large, the system will fall into local minima and no moving solution can be obtained. In contrast, if the penalty is too small, the effect may not be sufficient. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the amount of the penalty so that the agent always moves dynamically, and the energy-saving effect is sufficient. Nevertheless, since adjusting the hyperparameters is computationally expensive, we need a learning method that is robust to the penalty setting problem. We investigated on the Spiking Neural Network (SNN), which has been attracting attention for its computational efficiency and neuromorphic architecture. We conducted gait experiments using a hexapod agent while varying the energy penalty settings in the simulation environment. By applying SNN to the conventional state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, we examined whether the agent could explore for an optimal gait with a larger penalty variation and obtain an energy-efficient gait verified with Cost of Transport (CoT), a metric of energy efficiency for gait. Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)+SNN resulted in a CoT of 1.64, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3)+SNN resulted in a CoT of 2.21, and Deep Deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)+SNN resulted in a CoT of 2.08 (1.91 for normal SAC, 2.38 for TD3, and 2.40 for DDPG). DRL combined with SNN succeeded in learning more energy efficient gait with lower CoT.",

However, the trial and error intrinsic nature of RL may result in long training time on real robots and, moreover, it may lead to dangerous outcomes. While simulators are useful tools to accelerate RL training and to ensure safety, they often are provided only with an approximated model of robot dynamics and of its interaction with the surrounding environment, thus resulting in what is called the reality gap (RG): a mismatch of simulated and real control-law performances caused by the inaccurate representation of the real environment in simulation. The most undesirable result occurs when the controller learnt in simulation fails the task on the real robot, thus resulting in an unsuccessful sim-to-real transfer. The goal of the present survey is threefold: (1) to identify the main approaches to face the RG problem in the context of robot control with RL, (2) to point out their shortcomings, and (3) to outline new potential research areas.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3139080,Multi-Robot Hybrid Coverage Path Planning for 3D Reconstruction of Large Structures,"Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is an essential capability for autonomous robots operating in various critical applications such as fire fighting, and inspection. Performing autonomous coverage using a single robot system consumes time and energy. In particular, 3D large structures might contain some complex and occluded areas that shall be scanned rapidly in certain application domains. In this paper, a new Hybrid Coverage Path Planning (HCPP) approach is proposed to explore and cover unknown 3D large structures using a decentralized multi-robot system. The HCPP approach combines a guided Next Best View (NBV) approach with a developed Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) waypoint prediction approach to decrease the CPP exploration time at each iteration and simultaneously achieve high coverage. The hybrid approach is the new ML paradigm which fosters intelligence by balancing between data efficiency and generality allowing the exchange of some CPP parts with a learned model. The HCPP uses a stateful LSTM network architecture which is trained based on collected paths that cover different 3D structures to predict the next viewpoint. This architecture captures the dynamic dependencies of adjacent viewpoints in the long term sequences like the coverage paths. The HCPP switches between these methods triggered by either the number of iterations or an entropy threshold. In the decentralized multi-robot system, the proposed HCPP is embedded in each robot where each one of them shares its global 3D map ensuring robustness. The results performed in a realistic Gazebo robotic simulator confirmed the advantage of the proposed HCPP approach by achieving high coverage on different 3D unknown structures in a shorter time compared to conventional NBV.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3151090,Improving the QoS in 5G HetNets Through Cooperative Q-Learning,"Heterogeneous networks are an integral part of the 5G cellular networks as they are one of the important enabling technologies for increased coverage and capacity. However, interferences in multi-tiered architecture bottleneck its performance. Although multiple schemes have been proposed for efficient radio resource management to handle the interferences in heterogeneous networks but provision of quality of service to macrocell and small cell user equipment simultaneously, is still an open research problem. Intelligent schemes for radio resource management in heterogeneous networks have proved their effectiveness due to their self-optimization capabilities. In this research article, a cooperative Q-Learning, algorithm is proposed for efficient joint radio resource management in ultra-dense heterogeneous networks to handle interferences by adaptive power allocation to small cell base stations while considering the minimum quality of service requirements. In this proposed cooperative Q-Learning algorithm, small cell base stations interacts with the neighboring small cell base stations to exchange information and performs self-optimization based on a joint reward function. The proposed solution not only provided significant improvement in the capacity of macrocell and small cell user equipment as compared to other state of art Q-Learning based radio resource management schemes but also ensure the provision of quality of service to all macrocell and small cell user equipment simultaneously in the cluster of 16 small cells. The proposed solution provided a minimum capacity of 2 b/s/Hz to macrocell and small cell user equipment which is 100% higher than the minimum quality of service requirements defined in literature where none of recently proposed solution could meet minimum quality of service requirements. The results analysis shows that cooperation among the small cells yields a significant improvement of 48% in capacity of small cell user equipment at the cost of a slight increase in computational time as compared to independent learning.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3154388,Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient-Based Target Tracking for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle With Achievement Rewarding and Multistage Training,"Target tracking using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a challenging robotic problem. It requires handling a high level of nonlinearity and dynamics. Model-free control effectively handles the uncertain nature of the problem, and reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches are a good candidate for solving this problem. In this article, the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm (TD3), as recent and composite architecture of RL, was explored as a tracking agent for the UAV-based target tracking problem. Several improvements on the original TD3 were also performed. First, the proportional-differential controller was used to boost the exploration of the TD3 in training. Second, a novel reward formulation for the UAV-based target tracking enabled a careful combination of the various dynamic variables in the reward functions. This was accomplished by incorporating two exponential functions to limit the effect of velocity and acceleration to prevent the deformation in the policy function approximation. In addition, the concept of multistage training based on the dynamic variables was proposed as an opposing concept to one-stage combinatory training. Third, an enhancement of the rewarding function by including piecewise decomposition was used to enable more stable learning behaviour of the policy and move out from the linear reward to the achievement formula. The training was conducted based on fixed target tracking followed by moving target tracking. The flight testing was conducted based on three types of target trajectories: fixed, square, and blinking. The multistage training achieved the best performance with both exponential and achievement rewarding for the fixed trained agent with the fixed and square moving target and for the combined agent with both exponential and achievement rewarding for a fixed trained agent in the case of a blinking target. With respect to the traditional proportional differential controller, the maximum error reduction rate is 86%. The developed achievement rewarding and the multistage training opens the door to various applications of RL in target tracking.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3163393,A Low-Cost Q-Learning-Based Approach to Handle Continuous Space Problems for Decentralized Multi-Agent Robot Navigation in Cluttered Environments,"This paper addresses the problem of navigating decentralized multi-agent systems in partially cluttered environments and proposes a new machine-learning-based approach to solve it. On the basis of this approach, a new robust and flexible Q-learning-based model is proposed to handle a continuous space problem. As in reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, Q-learning does not require a model of the environment. Additionally, Q-Learning (QL) has the advantages of being fast and easy to design. However, one disadvantage of QL is that it needs a massive amount of memory, and it grows exponentially with each extra feature introduced to the state space. In this research, we introduce an agent-level decentralized collision avoidance low-cost model for solving a continuous space problem in partially cluttered environments, followed by introducing a method to merge non-overlapping QL features in order to reduce its size significantly by about 70% and make it possible to solve more complicated scenarios with the same memory size. Additionally, another method is proposed for minimizing the sensory data that is used by the controller. A combination of these methods is able to handle swarm navigation low memory cost with at least18 number of robots. These methods can also be adapted for deep q-learning architectures so as to increase their approximation performance and also decrease their learning time process. Experiments reveal that the proposed method also achieves a high degree of accuracy for multi-agent systems in complex scenarios.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3165551,Toward an Automated Learning Control Architecture for Cyber-Physical Manufacturing Systems,"Manufacturers are constantly looking to enhance the performance of their manufacturing systems by improving their ability to address disruptions and disturbances, while reducing cost and maximizing quantity and quality. Even though innovative mechanisms for adaptability and flexibility continuously contribute to the smart manufacturing evolutionary process, they generally stop short of providing a capability for coordinated on-line learning. This is especially true when that learning requires exploration outside of established operational boundaries or uses artificial intelligence (as opposed to purely human intelligence) as part of the dynamic implementation of learning. In this work, we provide a vision for the development of an automated learning control architecture to extend the adaptability and flexibility capabilities of manufacturing systems. As part of this vision, we describe a set of requirements and objectives that, if addressed, provide an environment to allow distributed and automated learning across the manufacturing ecosystem. We then provide an example communication and control architecture that meets these requirements and objectives by gathering information, building a dynamic knowledge base, distributing intelligence, making decisions, and adapting the control commands sent to the equipment and people across the manufacturing ecosystem. The example architecture leverages both centralized and distributed control strategies and the ability to switch between the strategies to gather and learn from information in the system. Example case studies are provided illustrating how this architecture can be used to improve manufacturing system performance.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3166160,"Supporting Intelligence in Disaggregated Open Radio Access Networks: Architectural Principles, AI/ML Workflow, and Use Cases","Driven by the emerging trend for transparent, open and programmable communications, Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) constitutes the dominant architectural approach for deploying the future wireless networks. Towards standardizing and specifying the building blocks and principles of O-RAN, a coordinated global effort has been observed, mainly comprised of the O-RAN Alliance, the operators and several research activities. This paper presents the architectural aspects and the current status of O-RAN deployments, integrating both existing and ongoing activities from the O-RAN enablers. Furthermore, since the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) act as key pillars for realizing O-RANs, a comprehensive view on the AI/ML functionality is provided as well. Additionally, a Network Telemetry (NT) architecture is also proposed to ensure end-to-end data collection and real-time analytics. To concretely illustrate the O-RAN supporting mechanisms for hosting AI/ML, we implemented two realistic ML algorithms: (i) a Supervised Learning (SL) based algorithm for cell traffic prediction using the training data of an open dataset and (ii) a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based algorithm for energy-efficiency maximization using a 5G-compliant simulator to obtain RAN measurements. We schematically demonstrate the AI/ML workflow for both ML-assisted algorithms through the usage of xApps running on the Radio Intelligent Controller (RIC), as well as we outline the role of the O-RAN components involved in the AI/ML loop. Combining the high-level architectural descriptions with a detailed presentation of ML-empowered resource allocation schemes, the paper discusses and summarizes the O-RAN disaggregation principles and the role of AI/ML embedded in future O-RAN deployments.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3166179,Optimal Frequency Reuse and Power Control in Multi-UAV Wireless Networks: Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Perspective,"To overcome the problems caused by the limited battery lifetime in multiple-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) wireless networks, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of UAVs by finding the optimal frequency reuse factor and transmit power. The proposed algorithm consists of distributed inner-loop RL for transmit power control of the UAV terminal (UT) and centralized outer-loop RL for finding the optimal frequency reuse factor. Specifically, the proposed algorithm adjusts these two factors jointly to effectively mitigate intercell interference and reduce undesired transmit power consumption in multi-UAV wireless networks. We show that, for this reason, the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional algorithms, such as a random action algorithm with a fixed frequency reuse factor and a hierarchical multi-agent Q-learning algorithm with binary transmit power controls. Furthermore, even in the environment where UTs are continuously moving based on the mixed mobility model, we show that the proposed algorithm can find the best reward when compared to conventional algorithms.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3176104,Explaining Intelligent Agent’s Future Motion on Basis of Vocabulary Learning With Human Goal Inference,"Intelligent agents (IAs) that use machine learning for decision-making often lack the explainability about what they are going to do, which makes human-IA collaboration challenging. However, previous methods of explaining IA behavior require IA developers to predefine vocabulary that expresses motion, which is problematic as IA decision-making becomes complex. This paper proposes Manifestor, a method for explaining an IA’s future motion with autonomous vocabulary learning. With Manifestor, an IA can learn vocabulary from a person’s instructions about how the IA should act. A notable contribution of this paper is that we formalized the communication gap between a person and IA in the vocabulary-learning phase, that is, the IA’s goal may be different from what the person wants the IA to achieve, and the IA needs to infer the latter to judge whether a motion matches that person’s instruction. We evaluated Manifestor by investigating whether people can accurately predict an IA’s future motion with explanations generated with Manifestor. We compared Manifestor’s vocabulary with that from optimal acquired in a situation in which the communication-gap problem did not exist and that from ablation, which was learned with a false assumption that an IA and person shared a goal. The experimental results revealed that vocabulary learned with Manifestor improved people’s prediction accuracy as much as with optimal, while ablation failed, suggesting that Manifestor can enable an IA to properly learn vocabulary from people’s instructions even if a communication gap exists.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3188808,F-CBR: An Architecture for Federated Case-Based Reasoning,"Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a problem-solving methodology in artificial intelligence that attempts to solve new problems using past experiences known as cases. Experiences collected in a single case base from an institution or geographical region are seldom sufficient to solve diverse problems, especially in rare situations. Additionally, many institutions do not promote peer-to-peer (p2p) communication or encourage data sharing through such networks to retain autonomy. The paper proposes a federated CBR (F-CBR) architecture to address these challenges. F-CBR enables solving new problems based on similar cases from multiple autonomous CBR systems without p2p communication. We also designed an algorithm to minimize (irrelevant or unsolicited) data sharing in an F-CBR system. We extend the F-CBR design to support institutions with organizational or geographical hierarchies. The F-CBR architecture was implemented and evaluated on two public datasets and a private real-world (non-specific musculoskeletal disorder patient) dataset. The findings demonstrate that the retrieval quality of F-CBR systems is comparable to or better than a single CBR system that persists all the cases on a centralized case base. F-CBR systems address data privacy by incorporating the data minimization principle. We foresee F-CBR as a viable real-world design that can aid in federating legacy CBR systems with minimal or no changes. The CBR systems used in this study are shared on GitHub to support reproducibility.",

In this paper we present a novel algorithmic architecture that tackle this problem in the particular case of Anomaly Detection (or classification of rare events), a setting where typical applications often comprise data with sensible information, but where the scarcity of anomalous examples encourages collaboration. We show how Random Forests can be used as a tool for the development of accurate classifiers with an effective insight-sharing mechanism that does not break the data integrity. Moreover, we explain how the new architecture can be readily integrated in a blockchain infrastructure to ensure the verifiable and auditable execution of the algorithm. Furthermore, we discuss how this work may set the basis for a more general approach for the design of collaborative ensemble-learning methods beyond the specific task and architecture discussed in this paper.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3202208,Autonomous Drone Swarm Navigation and Multitarget Tracking With Island Policy-Based Optimization Framework,"Swarm intelligence has been applied to replicate numerous natural processes and relatively simple species to achieve excellent performance in a variety of disciplines. An autonomous approach employing deep reinforcement learning is presented in this study for swarm navigation. In this approach, complex 3D environments with static and dynamic obstacles and resistive forces such as linear drag, angular drag, and gravity are modeled to track multiple dynamic targets. In this regard, a novel island policy optimization model is introduced to tackle multiple dynamic targets simultaneously and thus make the swarm more dynamic. Moreover, new reward functions for robust swarm formation and target tracking are devised to learn complex swarm behaviors. Since the number of agents is not fixed and has only the partial observance of the environment, swarm formation and navigation become challenging. In this regard, the proposed strategy consists of four main components to tackle the aforementioned challenges: 1) Island policy-based optimization framework with multiple targets tracking 2) Novel reward functions for multiple dynamic target tracking 3) Improved policy and critic-based framework for the dynamic swarm management 4) Memory. The dynamic swarm management phase translates basic sensory input to high-level commands and thus enhances swarm navigation and decentralized setup while maintaining the swarm’s size fluctuations. While in the island model, the swarm can split into individual sub-swarms according to the number of targets, thus allowing it to track multiple targets that are far apart. Also, when multiple targets come close to each other, these sub-swarms have the ability to rejoin and thus form a single swarm surrounding all the targets. Customized state-of-the-art policy-based deep reinforcement learning neuro-architectures are employed to achieve policy optimization. The results show that the proposed strategy enhances swarm navigation by achieving a high cumulative reward and a low policy loss. The simulations show that the proposed framework can efficiently track multiple static and dynamic targets in complex environments.",

In addition, the advanced deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has boosted extensive novel research results and industrial products in terms of aerial-ground networks. However, with the rapid development of mobile networks and growing requirements for low-latency services, the conventional centralized aerial-ground network has failed to meet the time-varying expectations of mobile users in the dynamic network environment. To cope with the problems, the marriage of the aerial-ground network and innovative AI techniques, i.e., distributed artificial intelligence enabled aerial-ground network (DAIAGN), is proposed in this article, which consists of three vital components: deep reinforcement learning enabled distributed information sharing, edge intelligence enabled distributed security management, and multi-agent reinforcement learning enabled distributed decision making. The functions of the three components are elaborated, and recent related advances are surveyed in detail. A specific case study is also provided with respect to multi-agent reinforcement learning enabled distributed decision making. Furthermore, key challenges and open issues are also discussed to provide some guidances for potential future directions.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3218653,A Centralized Strategy for Multi-Agent Exploration,"This paper introduces recently developed Aquila Optimization Algorithm specifically configured for Multi-Robot space exploration. The proposed hybrid framework “Coordinated Multi-Robot Exploration Aquila Optimizer” (CME-AO) is a unique combination of both deterministic Coordinated Multi-robot Exploration (CME) and a swarm based methodology, known as Aquila Optimizer (AO). A novel parallel communication protocol is also embedded to improve multi-robot space exploration process while simultaneously minimizing both the computation complexity and time. This ensures acquisition of a optimal collision-free path in a barrier-filled environment via generating a finite map. The architecture starts by determining the cost and utility values of neighbouring cells around the robot using deterministic CME. Aquila Optimization technique is then incorporated to increase the overall solution accuracy. Numerous simulations under different environmental conditions were then performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Algorithm consistency aspects in achieving the expected results (area explored rate and time) is demonstrated through statistical means. A perspective analysis is then performed by comparing the performance of the CME-AO algorithm with latest state of art contemporary algorithms namely conventional CME and CME-WO (CME Whale Optimizer). The comparison duly accommodates all pertinent aspects such as % area explored, number of failed runs, and time taken for map exploration for different environments. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm presents two distinct advantages over the other conventional state of the art CME based techniques a) enhanced map exploration in cluttered environment and b) significantly reduced computation complexity and execution time, with almost no fail runs. This makes the suggested methodology particularly suitable for on-board utilization in an obstacle-cluttered environment, where other techniques either fails (stuck locally) or takes longer exploration time.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3223446,E-CNMPC: Edge-Based Centralized Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Multiagent Robotic Systems,"With the wide deployment of autonomous multi-agent robotic systems, control solutions based on centralized algorithms have been developed. Even though these centralized algorithms can optimize the performance of the multi-agent robotic systems, they require a lot of computational effort, and a centralized unit to undertake the entire process. Yet, many robotic platforms like some ground robots and even more, aerial robots, do not have the computing capacity to execute this kind of frameworks on their onboard computers. While cloud computing has been used as a solution for offloading computationally demanding robotic applications, from the robots to the cloud servers, the latency they introduce to the system has made them unsuitable for time sensitive applications. To overcome these challenges, this article promotes an Edge computing-based Centralized Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (E-CNMPC) framework to control, and optimize, in swarm formation, the trajectory of multiple ground robotic agents, while taking under consideration potential collisions. The data processing procedure for the time critical application of controlling the robots in a centralized manner, is offloaded to the edge machine, thus the framework benefits from the provided edge resources, features, and centralized optimal performance, while the latency remains bounded in desired values. Besides, real experiments were conducted as a proof-of-concept of the proposed framework to evaluate the system’s performance and effectiveness.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3225689,Toward Interactive Music Generation: A Position Paper,"Music generation using deep learning has received considerable attention in recent years. Researchers have developed various generative models capable of imitating musical conventions, comprehending the musical corpora, and generating new samples based on the learning outcome. Although the samples generated by these models are persuasive, they often lack musical structure and creativity. For instance, a vanilla end-to-end approach, which deals with all levels of music representation at once, does not offer human-level control and interaction during the learning process, leading to constrained results. Indeed, music creation is a recurrent process that follows some principles by a musician, where various musical features are reused or adapted. On the other hand, a musical piece adheres to a musical style, breaking down into precise concepts of timbre style, performance style, composition style, and the coherency between these aspects. Here, we study and analyze the current advances in music generation using deep learning models through different criteria. We discuss the shortcomings and limitations of these models regarding interactivity and adaptability. Finally, we draw the potential future research direction addressing multi-agent systems and reinforcement learning algorithms to alleviate these shortcomings and limitations.",

Big data techniques have opened up numerous opportunities to utilize massive datasets in several effective ways to improve the efficacy of related industries. This paper presents a review of big data technologies used in the power, mineral, and manufacturing industries for various purposes. We analyze the meta-data of the collected papers before reviewing and selecting papers by applying selection criteria and paper quality assessment strategy. Then we propose a taxonomy of big data application areas in the power, mineral, and manufacturing industries. We have studied current big data architectures and techniques implemented in industry sectors and have uncovered the big data research gaps in industry sectors. To address the gaps, we point out some relevant research questions and, to answer the questions, we make some future research recommendations that might explore interesting research ideas for building a big data-driven industry. As the careful use of big data benefits every other industry sector; hence, supportive big data frameworks need to be developed to speed up the big data analysis process. Proper multi-dimensional big data assessment is also needed to take into account for serving effective data analysis tasks. Industry automation is also heavily influenced by the proper utilization of big data.

10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3251571,IEEE Access,"Federated Learning (FL) systems orchestrate the cooperative training of a shared Machine Learning (ML) model across connected devices. Recently, decentralized FL architectures driven by consensus have been proposed to enable the devices to share and aggregate the ML model parameters via direct sidelink communications. The approach has the advantage of promoting the federation among the agents even in the absence of a server, but may require an intensive use of communication resources compared to vanilla FL methods. This paper proposes a communication-efficient design of consensus-driven FL optimized for training of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Devices independently select fragments of the DNN to be shared with neighbors on each training round. Selection is based on a local optimizer that trades model quality improvement with sidelink communication resource savings. The proposed technique is validated on a vehicular cooperative sensing use case characterized by challenging real-world datasets and complex DNNs typically employed in autonomous driving with up to 40 trainable layers. The impact of layer selection is analyzed under different distributed coordination configurations. The results show that it is better to prioritize the DNN layers possessing few parameters, while the selection policy should optimally balance gradient sorting and randomization. Latency, accuracy and communication tradeoffs are analyzed in detail targeting sustainable federation policies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3254900,Optimizing Parallel Task Execution for Multi-Agent Mission Planning,"Multi-agent systems have received a tremendous amount of attention in many areas of research and industry, especially in robotics and computer science. With the increased number of agents in missions, the problem of allocation of tasks to agents arose, and it is one of the most fundamental classes of problems in robotics, formally known as the Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) problem. MRTA encapsulates numerous problem dimensions, and it aims at providing formulations and solutions to various problem configurations, i.e., complex multi-agent missions. One dimension of the MRTA problem has not caught much of the research attention. In particular, problem configurations including Multi-Task (MT) robots have been neglected. However, the increase in computational power, in robotic systems, has allowed the utilization of parallel task execution. This in turn had the benefit of allowing the creation of more complex robotic missions; however, it came at the cost of increased problem complexity. Our contribution to the aforementioned domain can be grouped into three categories. First, we model the problem using two different approaches, Integer Linear Programming and Constraint Programming. With these models, we aim at filling the gap in the literature related to the formal definition of MT robot problem configuration. Second, we introduce the distinction between physical and virtual tasks and their mutual relationship in terms of parallel task execution. This distinction allows the modeling of a wider range of missions while exploiting possible parallel task execution. Finally, we provide a comprehensive performance analysis of both models, by implementing and validating them in CPLEX and CP Optimizer on the set of problems. Each problem consists of the same set of test instances gradually increasing in complexity, while the percentage of virtual tasks in each problem is different. The analysis of the results includes exploration of the scalability of both models and solvers, the effect of virtual tasks on the solvers’ performance, and overall solution quality.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3259544,Explaining a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-Based Automated Driving Agent in Highway Simulations,"As deep learning models have become increasingly complex, it is critical to understand their decision-making, particularly in safety-relevant applications. In order to support a quantitative interpretation of an autonomous agent trained through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in the highway-env simulation environment, we propose a framework featuring three types of views for analyzing data: (i) episode timeline, (ii) frame by frame, and (iii) aggregated statistical analysis, also including heatmaps for a better spatial understanding. Our methodology allowed a novel, consistent description of the behavior of the agent. The main motivator for the taken action is typically the longitudinal distance from the second-closest and, to a lower extent, third-closest vehicle. In the overtakes, also the agent’s position in lanes becomes relevant. The analysis identified interesting patterns and an issue in the last frames of an episode, when the agent is unable to overtake the last two vehicles, arguably because of the lack of reference vehicles ahead. We observed a clear differentiation between attention and SHAP values (estimating the importance of each feature for each decision), reflecting the architecture of the neural network, where the first layer implements the attention mechanism, while the deeper ones make the actual decision. Attention focuses on the proximity of the ego, while the decision is taken on a wider horizon, denoting a valuable anticipation capability. To support research, the proposed framework is released as open source.",

Various applications rely on the infrastructure of P2P networks, where nodes communicate to accomplish a task without the need for a central authority. One of the significant challenges in P2P networks is the ability of the network nodes to reach a consensus on a shared item; the challenge increases as time passes. Thus, this work proposes a new effective method for tweaking the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm to train Deep Q Network (DQN) learning agents to reach a consensus among the P2P nodes. We propose various hierarchies of deep agents to address this crucial challenge in P2P networks. DRL is utilized to build and train agents; more precisely, DQN learning agents are constructed and trained. Two scenarios are proposed and evaluated. In the first scenario, one DQN agent is trained to find the consensus between the network nodes. In the second scenario, three hierarchies with different numbers of layers of agents are proposed and evaluated. In both scenarios, the P2P network used is a blockchain network. The best result was obtained using the third hierarchy of the second scenario; the overall accuracy of the model is 87.8%.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3273787,Integrating Local Motion Planning and Robust Decentralized Fault-Tolerant Tracking Control for Search and Rescue Task of Hybrid UAVs and Biped Robots Team System,"In this study, we integrate a local motion planning and robust  $H_{\infty} $  decentralized observer-based feedforward reference tracking fault-tolerant control (FTC) of a hybrid UAVs and biped robots team system (URTS) for the purpose of search and rescue (S&R). A system architecture of performing S&R tasks for each agent in URTS is proposed to explain how to integrate reference trajectory planning and tracking control in URTS for S&R usage. In order to optimally allocate tasks to each agent in URTS, a task allocate problem is investigated. In order to optimally plan a path for each agent in URTS to reach these allocated task locations, a path planning problem is formulated. To deal with complex S&R terrain, we decompose the path planning problem into three steps, i.e., (i) global path planning, (ii) behavior decision and (iii) local motion planning. Through such decomposition, some roadmap-based path planning algorithms can be applied to the global path planning of agents in URTS. By the behavior decision, we can decide what behavior to follow the global path according to the terrain environment. Next, we focus on the local motion planning problem of flying behavior for UAV and walking behavior for robot, and then the tracking control problem for UAVs and robots in the hybrid team system. By a proposed novel feedforward linearization control scheme, the robust  $H_{\infty} $  decentralized observer-based feedforward reference tracking FTC design is significantly simplified for each agent in URTS. A novel smoothing signal model of fault signal is embedded to achieve the active FTC through observer estimation. Then, the design of the robust  $H_{\infty} $  decentralized observer-based feedforward reference tracking FTC strategy is transformed into a linear matrix inequality (LMI) -constrained optimization problem of each agent. With the help of MATLAB LMI Toolbox, the robust  $H_{\infty} $  decentralized observer-based feedforward reference tracking FTC design problem of each UAV and robot in URTS is effectively solved. Finally, the simulation results are used to demonstrate the integration of local motion planning with the S&R tasks of hybrid URTS and to verify the effectiveness of the proposed robust  $H_{\infty} $  decentralized observer-based feedforward reference tracking FTC method of hybrid URTS under the external disturbance and the actuator and sensor fault.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3276294,Designing Intelligent Agents in Normative Systems Toward Data Regulation Representation,"Personal data protection regulation plays an important role in defining the rights and obligations of the agents involved in processing personal data (i.e., data subjects, controllers, and processors). These agents are allowed to execute actions to achieve their goals by obeying the personal data protection rules; however, this exercise may spawn data flow information asymmetry; for instance, a company may have more information regarding how that data is being used than individuals. This asymmetry can undermine individuals’ ability to protect their rights and interests and lead to a lack of trust in organizations and government bodies responsible for protecting their data. In this context, this article proposes: (i) a consent metamodel based on the literature to aid agents in identifying their major concerns when sharing personal data; (ii) a structure to build use case scenarios in the personal data regulation context; (iii) an intelligent normative multiagent system architecture to represent the personal data regulation rights and obligations, as well as the agent’s decision-making process. The latter will consider the normative rewards and punishments in the aforementioned scenario structure; (iv) a use case in the open banking scenario. This article demonstrates how we propose to contribute to representing agents’ preferences and data regulation concerns. We do so with a normative multiagent system and designing agents with cognitive reasoning capabilities.",

Self-organizing networks can fulfill the tight requirements of future networks but are challenging to use due to their complexity and immaturity. Moreover, the lack of an externally defined goal and centralized control has resulted in many distributed self-organizing systems failing. This is because the nonlinear relationships between the system parts result in emergence, i.e., we cannot predict the behavior of the whole from the behavior of the parts. Furthermore, a set of local optima does not produce a global optimum. Hybrid SONs tackle these challenges with loose or weak coupling of interacting agents that combine centralized control for global optimization with distributed control for local optimization. In the loose centralized control of almost autonomous agents, decisions are made mostly locally with small delays. This architecture has beneficial properties such as stability, obtained by decoupling the feedback loops: vertically with time-scale separation and horizontally with interference avoidance. Applications of loose coupling include modular electronics and computer design, structured software design, and service-oriented architectures, especially for microservices. Cross-layer design for network optimization is a new reason to use loose coupling in networks to improve stability. We also summarize some recent trends and present a roadmap to the future. We expect that loose coupling will be widely used in self-organizing networks of future wireless systems.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3291677,Online Decentralized Multi-Agents Meta-Learning With Byzantine Resiliency,"Meta-learning is a learning-to-learn paradigm that leverages past learning experiences for quick adaptation to new learning tasks. It has a wide application, such as in few-shot learning, reinforcement learning, neural architecture search, federated learning, etc. It has been extended to the online learning setting where task data distribution arrives sequentially. This provides continuous lifelong learning. However, in the online meta-learning setting, a single agent has to learn many varieties of related tasks. Yet, a single agent is limited to its local task data and must collaborate with neighboring agents to improve its learning performance. Therefore, online decentralized meta-learning algorithms are designed to allow an agent to collaborate with neighboring agents in order to improve learning performance. Despite their advantages, online decentralized meta-learning algorithms are susceptible to Byzantine attacks caused by the diffusion of poisonous information from unidentifiable Byzantine agents in the network. This is a serious problem where normal agents are unable to learn and convergence to the global meta-initializer is thwarted. State-of-the-art algorithms, such as BRIDGE, designed to provide robustness against Byzantine attacks are slow and cannot work in online learning settings. Therefore, we propose an online decentralized meta-learning algorithm that works with two Byzantine-resilient aggregation techniques, which are modified coordinate-wise screening and centerpoint aggregation. The proposed algorithm provides faster convergence speed and guarantees both resiliency and continuous lifelong learning. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than state-of-the-art algorithms.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3309417,Rational Coordination in Cognitive Agents: A Decision-Theoretic Approach Using ERMM,"Over the years, research in multi-agent systems has become increasingly popular. Agents evolve by interacting with their environment and must communicate with other agents in order to do various cooperative tasks. The research aims to provide efficient coordination among cooperative cognitive agents in unpredictable multi-agent situations. Xiang’s rational agent model addresses scenarios when no social conventions or predefined communication protocols exist for the agents’ interaction and then makes decisions by recursive modeling. We address the deficiencies of the loosely coupled framework and the problem of mispredictions in Xiang’s architecture. The solution is based on Lawniczak’s Architecture for generic cognitive agents and an enhanced model of Xiang’s Recursive Modeling Method for coordinated decision-making in multi-agent situations. We instruct the cognitive agent to learn about other agents from past mispredictions and then consider its best choice. The feedback module is incorporated so agents can learn to maximize their joint expected reward. The model filters the mispredictions and evaluates the error rate. We compare the enhanced method with the Recursive Modeling Method. The results show that mispredictions are corrected from 33% to 10.9% and errors in perception are reduced from 22% to 0.097%, as the system progresses. Overall, the approach demonstrates superior performance. It significantly lowers the rate of mispredictions about other agents’ actions and takes 30% to 42% less time and 55.4 % fewer moves than RMM.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3334791,Fine-Tuning Multimodal Transformer Models for Generating Actions in Virtual and Real Environments,"In this work, we propose and investigate an original approach to using a pre-trained multimodal transformer of a specialized architecture for controlling a robotic agent in an object manipulation task based on language instruction, which we refer to as RozumFormer. Our model is based on a bimodal (text-image) transformer architecture originally trained for solving tasks that use one or both modalities, such as language modeling, visual question answering, image captioning, text recognition, text-to-image generation, etc. The discussed model has been adapted for robotic manipulation tasks by organizing the input sequence of tokens in a particular way, consisting of tokens for text, images, and actions. We have demonstrated that such a model adapts well to new tasks and shows better results with fine-tuning than complete training in simulation and real environments. To transfer the model from the simulator to a real robot, new datasets were collected and annotated. In addition, experiments controlling the agent in a visual environment using reinforcement learning have shown that fine-tuning the model with a mixed dataset that includes examples from the initial visual-linguistic tasks only slightly decreases performance on these tasks, simplifying the addition of tasks from another domain.",

These processes can often be highly compute intensive, and would thus run slowly on the low-power computing platforms typically seen in autonomous systems. This paper examines how knowledge be represented in a Q-table and proposes a novel fast algorithm to mine that knowledge based on constraints. We evaluate this approach for the knowledge mining process of a specific agent: Cognitively Enhanced Complex Event Processing (CECEP). Within CECEP, knowledge is represented using Cognitive Domain Ontologies (CDO), and is mined using situational inputs and constraints. This is a novel approach to store information and is able to accommodate CDOs with millions of solutions. To show that the approach can run on low power hardware in real-time, this algorithm was executed on two low-power minicomputing platforms - Intel’s NUC and Asus’s Tinker Board. At present, no other optimized CDO solvers can generate solutions on these platforms. The algorithm generated the same amount of solutions as a GPU-enabled optimized path-based forward checking CDO solver, while consuming around 7.7 and 5.15 times less energy (Joules) on the NUC and Tinker Board respectively.",

This may be one factor that hinders a broader application of multi-agent systems in production systems. A possible solution to this problem is the combination of multi-agent systems with the concepts of micro-services and containerization, providing language-agnostic open interfaces, as well as encapsulation and modularity. In this paper, we propose an API and reference implementation that can be employed by multi-agent systems based on different languages and frameworks. Each agent component is encapsulated in a container and is accessed through its parent runtime platform, which takes care of aspects such as authentication, input validation, monitoring and other infrastructure tasks. Multiple runtime platforms can then be connected to form systems of distributed, heterogeneous multi-agent societies.",

EXplainable AI (XAI) aims at answering this demand, providing tools to get insights into the models’ behaviour and reasoning. Following this trend, our research paper explores the explainability of a deployed multimodal architecture applied to a real-world dataset of multivariate time series. The study aims to enhance the trustworthiness of an AI agent responsible for crash detection in an insurance company’s automatic assistance service. By introducing an XAI layer, we provide insights into the AI agent’s decision-making process, enabling the optimization of emergency medical services allocation. The dataset consists of real-world telematics data collected from vehicles equipped with black box technology. The challenge lies in explaining the complex interactions within the multivariate time series data to accurately understand the forces applied to vehicles during accidents. To this end, we adapt to this context two state-of-the-art XAI model-specific approaches, originally designed for images. We offer a qualitative and a quantitative evaluation, also comparing with a well-known agnostic method, and further validating our findings on an external dataset. The results show that Integrated Gradients, among the methodologies examined, is the most effective approach. Its ability to handle the complexity of the data provides the most comprehensive and insightful explanations for the considered use case. The findings emphasize the potential of XAI to enhance the trustworthiness of AI systems and optimize emergency response in the insurance industry.

These models notably minimize/exclude the involvement of developers in the composition, maintenance, and evolution of software systems. Despite extensive research on self-adaptive systems, systematic reviews focusing specifically on ESSs are lacking. This paper addresses this gap by performing a systematic literature review on ESSs. Our goal is to equip researchers and industry practitioners with a comprehensive view of existing ESSs, enabling them to select approaches that meet their requirements and identify potential research avenues. The research questions are centered around knowing what ESSs are and identifying the set of activities essential for their creation. From an initial collection of 496 papers identified through search engines, 39 papers met our inclusion and exclusion criteria for retention and in-depth analysis. Finally, we build a taxonomy to categorize existing ESS approaches and dissect various ESS definitions to pinpoint their main characteristics. The taxonomy is structured around the goals, processes and usability of ESSs. Our research reveals an emphasis on non-functional adaptation objectives within current ESSs. Despite this focus, the majority of existing ESSs are still in the proof-of-concept phase and have undergone minimal testing in industrial settings. While present ESS investigations largely revolve around areas such as web service computing, internet of things, and cyber-physical systems, we advocate for further exploration of their potential utility in other application domains such as robotics, aerospace, and unmanned vehicles.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3374376,Emotion-Related Pedagogical Agent: A Systematic Literature Review,"Pedagogical agent is a software agent that provides guidance, feedback, or intervention to learners in digital environments. It has the potential to address issues in computer-based learning, particularly online learning, which often neglects affective aspects, such as the emotions of its users. Most systematic literature reviews (SLR) on pedagogical agent have focused on their visual design, types of feedback, and other empirical elements. However, what underlies these agents’ ability to provide interventions personalized to learner’s emotions has not been examined. So, this SLR explores how pedagogical agent has addressed learner’s emotional needs. The study’s research questions include: 1) To what extent does research exist on models, frameworks, or architectures for pedagogical agent, especially those related to emotions? 2) How are pedagogical agent represented, what types of interventions do they use, and how do they affect learner’s emotions? 3) What kinds of inputs are used to activate the pedagogical agent’s functions? This SLR applied the Kitchenham method to select reference sources from 2013 to 2023 and was indexed by Scopus in the Q1 to Q4 range. Our review revealed the absence of a specific model for mapping out interventions tailored to the learner’s emotional needs. Most existing pedagogical agent provide learning interventions that are less adaptive and personalized based on the learner’s emotional state and are applied to asynchronous learning systems such as e-learning. There are still very few pedagogical agents that use real-time input technology by utilizing artificial intelligence to recognize learner’s emotion to trigger an adaptive and personalized intervention.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3390796,Incorporating Online Learning Into MCTS-Based Intention Progression,"Agents have been applied to a wide variety of fields, including power systems and spacecraft. Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents, as one of the most widely used and researched architectures, have the advantage of being able to pursue multiple goals in parallel. The problem of deciding “what to do” next at each of the agent’s deliberation cycle is therefore critical for BDI agents, which is defined as the intention progression problem (IPP). Among all existing approaches to IPP, the majority of approaches have overlooked the significance of runtime historical data, thereby limiting the adaptability and decision-making capabilities of agents. In this paper, we propose to incorporate online learning into the current state-of-the-art intention progression approach  $S_{A}$  to overcome the above limitations. This approach not only prevents  $S_{A}$  from consuming computational resources on ineffective and inefficient simulations, but also significantly improves the execution efficiency of the agent. Especially when dealing with large-scale problem domains, this improvement significantly enhances the planning capability of the agents. In particular, we have proposed the  $SA_{Q}$  and  $SA_{L}$  schedulers, both of which can learn how to generate “reasonable” rollouts during the simulation phase of MCTS based on historical simulation data at run time. We compare the performance of our approach with the state-of-the-art  $S_{A}$  in a range of scenarios of increasing difficulty. The results demonstrate that our approaches outperform  $S_{A}$ , both in terms of the number of goals achieved and the computational overhead required.",

A chatbot is a computer program that exhibits a capacity to converse quite naturally with users in a way that resembles a human dialogue. Examples of chatbots can be found in several areas, including education, commerce, and tourism. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its sub-fields, such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), is increasing across all business sectors. One of the most advanced applications of this technology is the chatbot, which is particularly beneficial due to the quick response times and its simplicity. Nevertheless, although studies on chatbots exist in tourism, academic research covering their adoption, technological evolution, and impact on this sector is still relatively sparse. Therefore, this study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of chatbots and their effect on tourism. First, we provide a new classification of chatbots based on specific criteria. Second, we explore the conceptual architecture of chatbots and their key components. Third, this study aims to assess and contrast the main existing tools for developing chatbots, classifying them and highlighting their key advantages and disadvantages. Fourth, this study aims to examine the integration of chatbots in the tourism sector by identifying their key applications in the industry over the past decade. Additionally, it seeks to analyze the impact of chatbots on the various functionalities outlined in the 6A framework for tourism. To achieve this, a thorough search will be conducted using five prominent databases - Scopus, ACM, IEEE Xplore, Springer Link, and Web of Science - covering the period from 2013 to 2023.

In various benchmarks, MAT consistently showed a strong performance. A key observation in the latest MAT frameworks is MARL modeling with sequence modeling (SM) to represent the inter-agent relationships by self-attention mechanisms. This study applies graph-based modeling to represent the inter-agent relationships present in agent interactions to improve performance. To this end, we introduce the so-called MAT-GAT model, which leverages Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to allow for individualized consideration of interactions between agents. This enables MAT to pay more attention to information relative to inter-agent interactions within a cooperative MARL environment. To evaluate the performance of MAT-GAT, we conducted a series of benchmark tests across three different levels of StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) tasks and the MuJoCo Half-cheetah task. The test results indicate that MAT-GAT outperforms both the original MAT and state-of-the-art baselines such as QMIX, particularly in complex environments. This demonstrates MAT-GAT’s improved performance with respect to its representation capabilities and learning.",

It focuses on designing, implementing, and evaluating an architecture that enables unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to coordinate and cooperate for complex tasks, with or without human intervention. Inspired by artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and robotics, the architecture integrates perception, planning, decision-making, and adaptive learning to optimize swarm behavior in dynamic environments. The architecture uses a distributed processing model based on the “edge-fog-cloud” (EFC) concept. Edge-level robots handle real-time data collection, local decision-making, and environmental perception. Fog-level vehicles manage intermediate processing and supervision of the groups, while cloud servers perform comprehensive data analysis and long-term storage, being the higher-level hierarchy of the framework. This structure allows efficient distribution of computational tasks, with critical decisions made at the robot level and complex analysis done in the fog or cloud. The implementation of ARCog-NET involves deploying a multi-agent simulation system using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Gazebo simulator, facilitating the integration of sensors, communication protocols, and data processing algorithms. The performance evaluation demonstrates the architecture’s effectiveness in a wind farm inspection scenario, where the UAV swarm exhibits improved trajectory planning, collision avoidance, and data processing efficiency.

D3T innovatively incorporates dimension-wise drop information embeddings within the Transformer architecture, facilitating effective decision-making even with incomplete observations. Our evaluation in the D4RL MuJoCo domain demonstrates that D3T significantly outperforms existing methods such as the Decision Transformer, particularly with substantial dimension-wise drops of observations.

However, these technologies remain in their early stages and face challenges such as understanding complex legal reasoning, managing biased data, ensuring transparency, and avoiding misleading responses, commonly referred to as hallucinations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Legal Query RAG (LQ-RAG), a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework with a recursive feedback mechanism specifically designed to overcome the critical shortcomings of standard RAG implementations in legal applications. The proposed framework incorporates four key components: a custom evaluation agent, a specialized response generation model, a prompt engineering agent, and a fine-tuned legal embedding LLM. Together, these components effectively minimize hallucinations, improve domain-specific accuracy, and deliver precise, high-quality responses for complex queries. Experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned embedding LLM achieves a 13% improvement in Hit Rate and a 15% improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Comparisons with general LLMs reveal a 24% performance gain when using the Hybrid Fine-Tuned Generative LLM (HFM), the specialized response generation model integrated into the LQ-RAG framework. Furthermore, LQ-RAG achieves a 23% improvement in relevance score over naive configurations and a 14% improvement over RAG with Fine-Tuned LLMs (FTM). These findings underscore the potential of domain-specific fine-tuned LLMs, combined with advanced RAG modules and feedback mechanisms, to significantly enhance the reliability and performance of AI in legal practice. The reliance of this study on a proprietary model as the evaluation agent, combined with the lack of feedback from human experts, highlights the need for improvement. Future efforts should focus on developing a specialized legal evaluation agent and enhancing its performance by incorporating feedback from domain experts.",

Nevertheless, existing deep learning-based predictive methods are unable to adequately address the current problem due to shortcomings in the training data, the model itself, or the architectures employed. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework for business process prediction based on improved BiLSTM-KAN, which addresses the issue of adaptability to continuous time data. This is achieved by enhancing the BiLSTM model’s ability to capture long-term dependencies through the addition of Agent Attention, while utilising KAN in place of the traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to improve prediction performance and mechanism interpretability. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all baseline methods in terms of prediction accuracy. This is evidenced by experiments conducted on five real publicly available event logs, which yielded improvements in accuracy of 12.4%, 7.16%, 9.77%, 12.27%, and 5.98%, respectively.

However, the inherently collaborative nature of agents is often overlooked, and many of these specialized systems are used as components by other AI systems. From a software engineering perspective, this context can benefit from aligning the architectural characteristics of distributed systems with the inherently distributed nature of MAS. We propose that introducing a minimal set of agent-related concepts into the Distributed Systems (DS) domain can improve the engineering of modern MAS by leveraging techniques from DS engineering with established agent theory. In this study, we recapitulated the common origins of MAS and DS by drawing architectural parallels to establish a unified engineering approach. We then defined a minimal set of agent concepts to perform two practical studies on leveraging MAS development. First, we incorporated these concepts into a DS architectural pattern to design a distributed MAS. We then used these concepts in a graduate course to teach MAS engineering to students with no prior knowledge of agent theory. The learning outcomes from both courses included successful MAS implementation using DS tools and techniques. Although more than two-thirds of these students had no practical experience in developing distributed systems, the average final grade in both courses was above 80%, thus validating our approach. Finally, we discuss how this study supports the development of advanced systems using modern AI techniques consistently with established agent-related research while leveraging established DS techniques and concepts.",

This study presents TrBot, a general-purpose Turkish chatbot that utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically a seq2seq model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. This architecture allows TrBot to manage sequential dependencies and effectively generate coherent responses, offering advantages in handling the complex morphological structure of Turkish. In contrast to earlier Turkish chatbots that were application-specific, TrBot is designed for broad conversational use across various topics. In this study, we also proposed and created two comprehensive datasets: a QA dataset with 40,702 entries and a conversation dataset with 304,446 entries, both specifically designed to enhance TrBot's performance. Trained on these datasets, TrBot achieved an accuracy of 80% on the QA dataset and 70% on the dialog dataset, with BLEU scores of 0.90 and 0.77 respectively, indicating substantial enhancements in response quality. In comparison, a Transformer-based model exhibited reduced training times but achieved lower accuracies of 60% on the QA dataset and 50% on the dialog dataset, with BLEU scores of 0.76 and 0.61 respectively, with the limited size of the datasets and available computational resources. The development of TrBot has significant implications, offering potential benefits in areas such as customer support, language learning, and other fields that require robust Turkish conversational capabilities.

In order to construct cohesive representations and extract meaningful insights from the environment, the brain utilizes patterns from a variety of sensory inputs, including vision and sound. Furthermore, related sensory inputs can activate each other’s representations, highlighting the brain’s ability to associate and integrate information across different sensory channels – key to cognitive development and adaptive learning. Current learning methods often mirror the developmental process of infants, who enhance their cognition through guidance and exploration. These methods often struggle with issues such as catastrophic forgetting and stability-plasticity trade-offs. This study presents a novel brain-inspired hierarchical autonomous framework, Cognitive Deep Self-Organizing Neural Network (CDSN), designed to enable autonomous agents to acquire object concepts dynamically. The architecture includes dual parallel audio-visual information pathways, incorporating three layers based on a Topological Kernel CIM-based Adaptive Resonance Neural Network (TC-ART). The first layer, referred to as the receptive layer, learns and organizes visual attributes and object names autonomously in an unsupervised manner. Subsequently, the second layer, the concept layer, distills clustered results from the corresponding receptive layer to create succinct symbol representation. In a synchronized manner, visual and auditory concepts are combined concurrently in the third layer, the associative layer, to establish real-time associative connections between the modalities. Furthermore, this layer introduces a top-down response approach, allowing agents to independently retrieve associated modalities and adapt acquired knowledge in a hierarchical manner. Experimental evaluations conducted on object datasets demonstrate the proposed architecture’s efficacy in online learning and the association of object viewpoints and labels. Our approach achieves superior recall accuracy, with rates of 92.25% for visual recall and 92.45% for auditory recall.

10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3561693,IEEE Access,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have found increasing application in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, yet challenges such as hallucinations and inconsistencies in the generated responses persist. This study presents an innovative methodology to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs by brokering and integrating multiple expert LLMs within a reflection layer to provide targeted feedback on the reasoning trajectories of the base LLM. The approach employs a foundational pre-trained LLM as the base model, which is further supported by agents to promote cognitive assistance for specific task types. In instances where conclusions are deemed incorrect or reasoning is interrupted, these instances are forwarded to the expert LLM layer, which includes systems such as Claude-3 haiku for intricate contexts and MedAlpaca for medical reasoning, to deliver feedback on the base model’s reasoning paths. This feedback forms a ‘reflection pool,’ enabling the base LLM to amend and enhance its reasoning trajectories in subsequent iterations. The experiments conducted across diverse datasets, including HotPotQA, SimpleQA, and PubmedQA, underscore the proposed architecture’s efficacy in augmenting success signals, Rouge-L scores (indicative of quality and precision), and CTRLEval Consistency Scores (indicative of coherence and consistency). The architecture effectively addresses the issues of hallucinations and inconsistencies that frequently occur in multi-step reasoning.

However, current wireless networks are designed as a “data pipe” and are not suited to accommodate and leverage the power of GenAI. In this paper, we propose the GenAINet framework in which distributed GenAI agents communicate knowledge (facts, experiences, and methods) to accomplish arbitrary tasks. We first propose an architecture for a single GenAI agent and then provide a network architecture integrating GenAI capabilities to manage both network protocols and applications. Building on this, we investigate effective communication and reasoning problems by proposing a semantic-native GenAINet. Specifically, GenAI agents extract semantics from heterogeneous raw data, build and maintain a knowledge model representing the semantic relationships among pieces of knowledge, which is retrieved by GenAI models for planning and reasoning. Under this paradigm, different levels of collaboration can be achieved flexibly depending on the complexity of targeted tasks. Furthermore, we conduct two case studies in which, through wireless device queries, we demonstrate that extracting, compressing and transferring common knowledge can improve query accuracy while reducing communication costs; and in the wireless power control problem, we show that distributed agents can complete general tasks independently through collaborative reasoning without predefined communication protocols. Finally, we discuss challenges and future research directions in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) in 6G networks.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3567244,ResilioMate: A Resilient Multi-Agent Task Executing Framework for Enhancing Small Language Models,"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been limited by their processing requirements and vulnerability to adversarial assaults, whilst short language models (SLMs) struggle with performance consistency in complex tasks. This research introduces ResilioMate, a resilient multi-agent framework that enhances SLMs by utilizing distributed cognitive burden distribution, dual-scale memory systems, and collaborative bias prevention strategies. The method employs dynamic task decomposition across specialized agents (e.g., Assistant, Checker) to minimize computational costs and combines short-term trajectory tracking with long-term self-reflective optimization for adaptive execution. At its core, the LeptoConnect model series (1.8B/7B parameters) is created using hybrid attention distillation and dynamic curriculum learning to enable cross-domain competence while retaining SLM efficiency. ResilioMate accomplishes three critical improvements: 1) The 1.8B LeptoConnect model attains 81.6% of GPT-4’s performance in knowledge graph construction through parameter-efficient fine-tuning with structured weight matrices; 2) LeptoConnect-7B achieves a score of 41.3 in database operations, compared to GPT-4’s 32.0, through collaborative cognitive load allocation; and 3) A bias-interception network effectively suppresses adversarial propagation while achieving code correction performance of ROUGE-L’s 42.86. The framework’s dual-scale memory architecture reduces computational redundancy by 26.4% through real-time task tracking and multi-agent knowledge refinement. These developments illustrate ResilioMate’s efficacy in bridging the performance gap between SLMs and LLMs, offering a scalable solution for the deployment of efficient language agents in real-time and peripheral computing environments.",

10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3576651,Dynamic Adaptation in an Intelligent Multi-Tutoring System: A Multi-Agent Approach,"Online learning provides new educational opportunities but continues to face high dropout rates compared to traditional classroom settings. To address this issue, we propose IMTS (Intelligent Multi-Tutoring System), an intelligent tutoring system that integrates both multi-tutoring and multidisciplinary capabilities. IMTS synergistically integrates automated tutoring (intelligent agents) and human tutoring (teachers and peers) to deliver personalized support to learners. The proposed architecture is based on a multi-agent system (MAS) that dynamically adapts pedagogical interventions according to the learners’ profiles and needs. By analysing learning progress in real time, the system continuously adjusts its recommendations and guides the student toward the most appropriate support (educational resources, peer interaction, or teacher intervention). IMTS was developed using the JADE platform and integrated into a customized Learning Management System (LMS). An experiment conducted with students demonstrated notably improved academic performance (e.g., a 20% relative score gain compared to control), increased engagement, and significantly reduced dropout rates (e.g., halved). These findings suggest that IMTS represents a significant advancement in online education by enabling more interactive, responsive, and personalised tutoring.",

Existing data platforms often fall short by emphasizing tools over alignment with business needs, resulting in inefficiencies and delays. To address this gap, I propose the Business Semantics Centric, AI Agents Assisted Data System (BSDS), a holistic system that integrates architecture, workflows, and team organization to ensure data systems are tailored to business priorities rather than dictated by technical constraints. BSDS redefines data systems as dynamic enablers of business success, transforming them from passive tools into active drivers of organizational growth. BSDS has a modular architecture that comprises curated data linked to business entities, a knowledge base for context-aware AI agents, and efficient data pipelines. AI agents play a pivotal role in assisting with data access and system management, reducing human effort, and improving scalability. Complementing this architecture, BSDS incorporates workflows optimized for both exploratory data analysis and production requirements, balancing speed of delivery with quality assurance. A key innovation of BSDS is its incorporation of the human factor. By aligning data team expertise with business semantics, BSDS bridges the gap between technical capabilities and business needs. Validated through real-world implementation, BSDS accelerates time-to-market for data-driven initiatives, enhances cross-functional collaboration, and provides a scalable blueprint for businesses of all sizes. Future research can build on BSDS to explore optimization strategies using complex systems and adaptive network theories, as well as developing autonomous data systems leveraging AI agents.",

These advancements have led to the development of specialized LLM-based agents designed for diverse tasks such as coding and web browsing. As these agents become more capable, the need for a robust framework that facilitates global agentic communication and collaboration for building sophisticated software solutions has become increasingly important. Distributed Agents in a Worldwide Network (DAWN) addresses this need by providing an architectural framework that allows globally distributed agents of any provenance to be registered, discovered, and organized for building AI-based applications and solutions.

10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3590264,Agentic AI Systems: Architecture and Evaluation Using a Frictionless Parking Scenario,"An AI agent is a goal-oriented autonomous computational entity that connects reasoning and action using large language models (LLMs) or Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), memory systems, and external tools to achieve contextually intelligent outcomes. An agentic AI system comprises and coordinates multiple specialized AI agents to achieve complex goals with minimal or no human supervision. In this paper, agentic AI systems are elucidated through a frictionless-parking scenario that illustrates core components of the system, namely the design of individual AI agents, their interaction mechanisms (handoff and cueing), and potential cooperation patterns (augmentative, integrative, and debative). This scenario provides an experimental test-bed for demonstrating how agentic AI can deliver context-aware, personalized services. A six-factor factorial experiment evaluates performance of the implemented AI agents across five user profiles, four GPT backbones, three entropy levels, three verbosity settings, three query complexities, and three prompt specificity levels. To guarantee that each agent’s recommendation is both plausible and constraint-compliant, the system combines guardrails, which reject or rewrite answers that violate user requirements, with Chain-of-Thought prompting that exposes intermediate reasoning steps for internal self-checks. Key metrics (agent’s response time or latency and lexical consistency) show that a lightweight gpt-4o-mini backbone and concise verbosity minimize latency, while medium prompt specificity and moderate query complexity optimize consistency. Decoding entropy influences stylistic diversity without significant latency costs but reduces consistency at high settings. User intent, particularly for creative or ambiguous profiles, drives variability. A SHAP analysis ranks model size, verbosity, and prompt specificity as top performance drivers.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3598712,IEEE Access,"Digital advertising infrastructure represents a substantial component of global computing resources, with significant environmental impact due to its massive energy consumption and carbon footprint. This work addresses the sustainability challenges posed by inefficient API traffic management in large-scale advertising systems, where conventional static approaches lead to resource overprovisioning and energy waste. We propose AdaptiveGate, a sustainability-oriented hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically optimizes API traffic flows to enhance resource efficiency and reduce environmental impact. The proposed methodology employs a constrained Markov Decision Process formulation with a multi-objective reward function explicitly designed to balance system performance with resource efficiency. Our framework implements a two-tier architecture of twin delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient agents: global agents minimize cross-datacenter energy expenditure through intelligent traffic routing, while local agents maximize resource utilization through service-specific load balancing. Empirical evaluation on production advertising systems processing over 2.5 million requests per second reveals significant sustainability improvements: 42.3% reduction in tail latency, 35.7% increase in throughput, and 18% decrease in overall energy consumption compared to state-of-the-art methods. The system demonstrates exceptional adaptability across diverse traffic conditions and operational scales, providing compelling evidence that AI-driven methods can substantially improve digital infrastructure sustainability.

10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3600962,An Innovative Prefabricated Microsystem for Industrial IoT: Addressing Remote Onboarding and OS Provisioning Challenges for Edge Nodes,"Chinese industrial IoT devices frequently encounter challenges during the cloud-based remote onboarding and OS provisioning: BIOS system of many industrial IoT devices does not support the HTTPS Boot protocol, which limits its ability to securely receive configuration information and increases security risks. Although there are alternative options such as PXE boot or manual configuration, both have security risks. For this reason, this paper has designed an innovative prefabricated micro-system with agent mechanism that enables Edge Nodes to securely access the cloud servers for management and control. Specifically, once the operator installs the uOS image on the Edge Node for initial deployment, bidirectional secure communication is established between the agent and the cloud server, enabling the Edge Node to successfully complete onboarding. Subsequently, the agent retrieves the latest configuration data from the cloud server to finalize provisioning. The pre-fabricated microsystem also supports fault recovery and process monitoring. Furthermore, this study conducts performance and maximum concurrency tests under both mTLS and TLS + JWT protocols. The innovative agent solution proposed herein will provide robust technical support and enhanced security guarantees for China’s Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).",
10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3601206,A Systematic Literature Review of Hallucinations in Large Language Models,"This review systematically maps research on hallucinations in large language models using a descriptive scheme that links model outputs to four system architectures: unaugmented generation, post-hoc reactive validation, proactive detection-and-mitigation, and fully integrated detection-and-mitigation designs. Our methodology for this systematic review follows the PRISMA guidelines to ensure transparency and reproducibility. We searched IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and ScienceDirect for studies published between 2015 and January 2025 and extracted 125 peer-reviewed papers across nine application domains. Quantitative analysis shows that question answering and multimodal tasks account for 48% of all papers, whereas software engineering, educational technology, and autonomous systems are underexplored. Although 87.5% of the studies rely on additional reactive or proactive defenses, only 8.8% implement integrated architecture-level safeguards, revealing a critical gap in unified and dynamic architectures. The resulting classification matrix and domain map provide a diagnostic tool for locating blind spots and comparing architectural maturity. Three actionable priorities emerge: develop integrated reasoning-and-verification loops that pre-empt hallucinations; transfer proven causal-intervention and multi-agent validation pipelines to high-stakes, under-represented domains and benchmark them under real conditions; and build modular, cross-domain evaluation frameworks that isolate the contribution of individual mitigation components and support ablation studies. By consolidating fragmented evidence and quantifying architecture-domain imbalances, this review establishes a traceable foundation for engineering reliable, explainable, and domain-adaptable countermeasures to hallucinations in generative language technology.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3602681,A Multi-Agent System for Cybersecurity Threat Detection and Correlation Using Large Language Models,"As cyber-attacks rapidly evolve across communication, infrastructure and data layers, traditional security solutions such as rule-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) or signature-based antivirus programs are effective at detecting known threats, but they often lack the contextual understanding and semantic interpretation necessary to detect complex or evolving attacks. For example, spear-phishing campaigns, advanced persistent threats (APTs), and multi-stage attacks often escape detection due to their subtle and context-dependent nature. This limitation creates a critical gap in detecting coordinated or subtle attack patterns that span multiple systems and domains. The need for semantic understanding, cross-domain visibility, and adaptive detection is increasingly urgent, particularly as threat actors employ polymorphic and AI-driven strategies that traditional systems cannot interpret or correlate effectively. This paper presents a modular multi-agent architecture that integrates established cybersecurity analysis tools with large language models (LLMs) to achieve intelligent, explicable and highly accurate detection of threats across diverse data types. Three specialized agents: 1) email verification, 2) log analysis, and 3) IP address scanning each operate independently with tailored detection pipelines that combine domain-specific tools and LLM-powered semantic analysis components to identify, characterize, and report threats specific to their domain. At the core of the system lies a contextual recommendation system that processes and cross-analyzes the outputs of all specialized agents to detect complex threat patterns such as multi-vector, time-based, or stealth attacks that would otherwise evade isolated detection mechanisms. The evaluation on benchmark datasets, including CIC-IDS 2017, SpamAssassin, and custom simulated network environments, demonstrates threat detection accuracy of 93.6%, multi-agent correlation accuracy of 87%, and false positive reduction of 41.3% compared to traditional approaches. The use of LLMs for both structured explanations and chain-of-thought reporting further enhances analyst confidence and reduces triage time.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3610526,"A Multi-Layered AI-Driven Cybersecurity Architecture: Integrating Entropy Analytics, Fuzzy Reasoning, Game Theory, and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Threat Defense","In the face of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, including adaptive adversaries and stealthy anomalies, key features of defense mechanisms should be effective, interpretable, and theoretically rooted. Conventional intrusion detection systems are typically based on a single-paradigm machine learning model which can be effective (because it is optimized for conditions), but fail in generalizability and falling back on an explanation of its prediction. This paper outlines a multi-layered AI-enabled cyber defense framework that integrates entropy analytics, fuzzy inference, game-theoretic defense, and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) inside a closed-loop adaptive architecture. In its simplest form, the novelty of the paper is that, four functional paradigms - uncertainty quantification, interpretability, strategic adversarial thinking, and live policy adaptation - are placed into a single coherent system. The framework operates as sequential and feedback salients - entropy analytics quantify the uncertainty in are states, fuzzy inference end maps the uncertainty into qualitative decision rules, game theory shapes defender - attacker towards equilibrium strategies, and MARL dynamically updates those strategies for convergence and long term adaptation. The empirical work on appropriate benchmark intrusion detection datasets consistently outperformed baseline systems including the DDN, Fed-ID, AG-IDS, DL-FL systems producing a 6-12% increase in detection accuracy, lower false positive rates from non-intrusions, and a faster convergence, with adversarial examples across multiple epochs. Also, practical case studies reveal a level of improved explainability in threat classification and anomaly detection, which equates to practical interpretability for security analysts from the framework. The major contributions of the work are threefold: 1) an integrated multi-layered AI-based cybersecurity framework, 2) theoretical robustness results in bounded adversarial models, and 3) performance and interpretability form the systematic empirical evaluations over multiple datasets.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3610890,UnifiedKP: A Unified Network Knowledge Plane for Large Model-Enabled 6G Networks,"The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and agentic systems is revolutionizing the landscape of 6G networks by enabling unprecedented levels of autonomous intelligence, including self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-healing capabilities. However, current implementations face significant challenges. Individual intelligence tasks require isolated knowledge retrieval pipelines. This isolation results in redundant data flows, inconsistent interpretations, and increased operational complexity. Inspired by the service model unification efforts in Open-RAN that promote interoperability and vendor diversity, we propose UnifiedKP: a unified Network Knowledge Plane specifically designed for large model-enabled autonomous 6G network intelligence. By decoupling network knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence logic, UnifiedKP streamlines development workflows and significantly reduces maintenance complexity for intelligence engineers. Through an intuitive and consistent knowledge interface, UnifiedKP enhances interoperability for network intelligence agents while maintaining semantic consistency across diverse intelligence tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of UnifiedKP through two representative intelligence applications: live network knowledge question-answering and edge AI service orchestration. Experimental results show that UnifiedKP reduces knowledge retrieval latency by 47%, improves knowledge consistency by 82%, and decreases development complexity by 65% compared to traditional isolated approaches. Our framework achieves 94.3% accuracy in network anomaly detection and reduces service orchestration time by 38% in dynamic edge computing environments. These findings establish UnifiedKP as a foundational architecture for realizing truly autonomous and intelligent 6G networks.",

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities across diverse tasks, including text generation, code synthesis, and complex multimodal reasoning, making them promising candidates for event prediction in dynamic, data-rich environments. This research presents an agentic reasoning framework combining temporal knowledge graphs, large language models (LLMs), and a modular tool-based architecture to address event extrapolation in complex, real-world settings. The methodology integrates agent-based reasoning, iterative tool invocation, and explicit validation mechanisms to ensure logical consistency and transparency in predictions. Experiments on country-specific subsets of the POLECAT dataset employ multiple LLM architectures and multiple evaluation metrics, including Hit@k, MRR, F1-scores and Prediction Entropy. Comparative analyses demonstrate that the agentic framework achieves robust predictive performance and interpretability, complementing fine-tuned LLM baselines. Furthermore, the ethical implications of deploying AI in social computing are addressed, including bias, transparency, and accountability. This study advances event prediction by demonstrating how agentic LLMs, equipped with explicit reasoning and validation, provide scalable and ethically grounded solutions for complex social event extrapolation.",

This study proposes an innovative solution to this problem by designing a multi-layered, adaptive Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) comprising interacting large language model (LLM) agents. The proposed system performs semantic-level information retrieval using a BioBERT-based vector database, enhances information retrieval by accessing up-to-date medical resources via the web, and restructures outputs by activating an adaptive optimization loop in low-confidence situations. Through the structuring of clinical texts, cross-validation of symptom analyses with literature and internet sources, and collaborative data fusion among agents, the system integrates multi-source data and produces consistent decisions. In experiments conducted on the MedQA, PubMedQA, and MedBullets datasets, the system achieved accuracies of 94%, 88%, and 84%, respectively, representing substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating the significance of the proposed architecture for clinical decision-making reliability. This framework is not merely an information retrieval engine; it is a clinical intelligence partner designed to learn, actively contribute to the decision process, and focus on reliability. In contrast to current CDSS protocols, which frequently depend on static modules or single-agent models, our architecture tackles some of the shortcomings in timeliness, multi-source evidence fusion, and confidence calibration. This originality enables the system to be a next-generation clinical intelligence partner by enabling an unprecedented level of transparency, customizability, and adaptability in real-world decision-making processes.",

We first conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of recent literature to assess how well LLMs understand, structure, and solve optimization problems across domains. The analysis is guided by critical review questions focusing on learning approaches, dataset designs, evaluation metrics, and prompting strategies. Our systematic evidence is complemented by targeted experiments designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in automatically generating optimization models for problems in computer networks. Using a newly constructed dataset, we apply three prompting strategies: Act-as-expert, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency, and evaluate the obtained outputs based on optimality gap, token-level F1 score, and compilation accuracy. Results show promising progress in LLMs’ ability to parse natural language and represent symbolic formulations, but also reveal key limitations in accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. These empirical gaps motivate several future research directions, including structured datasets, domain-specific fine-tuning, hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, modular multi-agent architectures, and dynamic retrieval via chain-of-RAGs.

10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3621887,Implementing Agentic AI Into ERP Software,"Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems serve as the backbone of modern business operations, digitalizing and integrating processes across organizational departments. These systems encompass a wide array of functions, including sales, marketing, finance, supply chain management, manufacturing, services, procurement, and human resources, acting as a centralized repository of organizational data and processes. The sheer scale and complexity of ERP solutions, which typically manage tens of thousands of business processes and store data in thousands of tables, present a significant opportunity for the integration of agentic artificial intelligence (AI). However, the implementation of agentic AI within ERP systems poses considerable challenges due to the intricate nature of these platforms. ERP solutions often comprise hundreds of millions of lines of code and are designed to accommodate a variety of industry-specific and regional requirements. This complexity necessitates a systematic approach to the development and integration of agentic AI capabilities. This paper addresses the critical research question: How can agentic AI business applications be systematically developed within ERP systems? To answer this, we employ a multi-faceted methodology encompassing the extraction of business requirements from real-world use cases, the design and development of a framework for agentic AI implementation, the evaluation of the proposed framework using actual ERP scenarios. Our research aims to bridge the gap between theoretical AI concepts and practical ERP implementation, providing a structured approach for organizations to leverage agentic AI within their existing ERP infrastructure.

These challenges stem from the need to manage dynamic mode transitions, closely linked inter-agent actions, and execution-time failures. This paper introduces the Adaptive and Modular Architecture (AMA) Execution and Planning components. AMA-Exec is a distributed execution framework designed to enable coherent, fault-tolerant mission execution in such conditions. AMA-Exec uses the plans produced by AMA-Plan, a PDDL-based planning framework. AMA-Exec incorporates Simple Temporal Networks (STNs) to facilitate temporal reasoning; modular Behavior Trees (BTs) to enable distributed execution; and runtime monitoring mechanisms to categorize failures, propagate delays, and execute partial replanning. In contrast to centralized, monolithic systems, AMA-Exec organizes execution around collaborative robot teams and leverages real-time feedback to maintain synchronization and temporal alignment under disturbances. We validate the framework on simulated trans-media missions, encompassing concurrent actions and a range of failure scenarios. Findings indicate enhanced execution continuity, applicability to more complex missions, and robust failure recovery in comparison to baseline methodologies.

Through RL, agents evaluate action values—rewards and penalties at each time step, aiming to converge toward optimal policies that enhance intrusion detection effectiveness. However, achieving reliable convergence in real-time environments remains uncertain, potentially impacting overall detection performance. This paper examines two prominent RL-based IDS architectures: a single-agent model and a game-theoretic multi-agent model, both employing the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm, to highlight the challenges associated with convergence in real-time environments. Using OMNeT++ simulation, a semi-realistic network environment was implemented to test the performance of both architectures. Key performance metrics including accumulated Q-values, loss, epsilon decay, detection accuracy, and precision were analyzed to evaluate the two models. The findings reveal that both the single-agent and game-theoretic multi-agent architectures exhibit unstable convergence, leading to reduced detection accuracy and precision. The observed metrics highlight areas for improvement and underscore the challenges that must be addressed to achieve optimal real-time intrusion detection using reinforcement learning.",

This work presents a unified perception and control framework that leverages a Faster Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster-RCNN) integrated with a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) optimization layer collectively referred to as the Faster-RCNN-Pose pipeline to enable accurate, low latency object detection and 6-DoF pose estimation across heterogeneous robotic agents. Unlike traditional decoupled pipelines, our end-to-end architecture performs simultaneous inference of object class, bounding box, and spatial orientation, thereby improving system level responsiveness and decision fidelity. By embedding this pipeline within an MQTT-based 5G communication infrastructure, robots can rapidly share spatial awareness, allocate tasks, and coordinate actions in real time. The proposed framework supports energy-aware navigation, multi-agent collaboration, and dynamic task reallocation, even as mission complexity and fleet size increase. Evaluations in open-environment deployments confirm that the system maintains high localization accuracy, low pose error, and consistent inter-agent coordination under motion, occlusion, and environmental variability. While communication latency remains a relevant constraint, especially in brokered architectures, the system includes latency compensation mechanisms and predictive control logic to preserve decision consistency.

This article introduces a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to autonomously manage the complexities of maintenance tasks in the space environment. The proposed model utilizes Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to effectively handle dynamic risk constraints and adapt in real-time to volatile conditions, such as orbital debris and system failures. Its architecture integrates a hierarchical layer of strategic planning agents, which allocate tasks and resources, with a reactive layer of execution agents that perform on-site operations. This dual-layer system is continuously informed by sophisticated models that simulate critical state transitions, including progressive device degradation, emergent environmental hazards, and the vital metric of astronaut stamina decay. Consequently, the framework generates optimal maintenance policies that rigorously maximize cost-efficiency and safety despite stringent constraints, including severely limited spare parts, restricted extravehicular activity durations, and unpredictable external risks. The model’s superiority is demonstrated to significantly reduce operational costs, minimize astronaut exposure to risk, and provide rapid, intelligent responses to stochastic component failures. This ensures the sustainability and success of long-duration space missions.",
10.1109/AERO.2008.4526527,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,"Revolutionary capabilities for robust control of inflatable Lunar and Martian transit vehicles and planetary habitats can be developed using advanced wireless network technology and modular avionics coupled with facile human to system interfaces. Fully wireless modular avionics would eliminate any cabling associated with power and data transmission, allowing easy deployment of flexible control systems and human interfaces. Furthermore, wearable human interface systems hosting virtual reality interaction methods can provide significant improvement in human situational awareness and control of dynamic space systems. The crew can interact with intelligent software agents providing human-like interaction using speech. These advanced information management systems would incorporate intelligent software agents to assist the crew in performing vehicle and mission operations. Advances in robust wireless data communications and wireless power transmission are the key technologies that enable this new spacecraft architecture. This paper will cover the proposed architecture for wireless spacecraft avionics including innovative human interaction techniques with spacecraft systems. The team believes these two aspects are intimately related and that mobile virtual human interfaces can solve many problems associated with operating spacecraft based on inflatable structures. Conventional architectures allocate much space to a cockpit from which the spacecraft is piloted and monitored. For the transit to Mars, which in most scenarios takes approximately 6 months, the cockpit becomes a major consumer of available space while being used only briefly during the journey for earth departure and planetary approach. Wireless control of the spacecraft would allow the piloting and monitoring function to be carried out from any location within the crew space. Identifying key technology developments required to support this architecture will involve evaluating current and next generation wireless networks, computational modules and wireless power transmission for avionics. Complementary methods for virtual human interfaces will be evaluated, with the rapid development of this technology enabling significant advances to be realized in the next decade. For piloting and monitoring functions it will be necessary to have virtual reality for looking outside the transit ship. Because of the radiation shielding required beyond the atmosphere and magnetosphere, there will be no clear view to the outside of the spacecraft. The visual capability will have to be provided by remote presence technology, which ties the virtual reality visual system with cameras on the outside of the craft. Spoken commanding and interaction with ship systems is also an important part of this concept. As ship systems become more complex, it will become impossible for the crew to remember exact details of all aspects of the operating environment. In this case the ability to ask questions about spacecraft status and have the agents issue audible spoken advisories and warnings becomes an important part of safely operating a very complex system. The shipboard agent systems can become in effect a much larger crew for the mission. With the round trip communication times approaching 40 minutes for the Mars transit, all of the mission operations knowledge will have to be built into the spacecraft, lessening dependence upon earth-based support. The operational authority has to be given to the astronauts augmented by virtual mission support provided by the knowledge agents on the spacecraft. A distributed wireless avionics system would provide the computational capacity for sophisticated support systems that inform the correct crewmember of a problem needing their attention, and to assist them in performing a complex task. ©2008 IEEE. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

We particularly focus on the design and development of a generic control and software architecture for a single modular AUV while allowing natural extensions to multi-vehicle scenarios. This proposed C2 system has a hybrid modular-hierarchical control architecture.

Each level consists of one or more autonomous agent components handling different C2 tasks. This structure provides the vehicle developers with an explicit view of the clearly defined control responsibilities at different level of control hierarchy.

In a multiagent system, action selection is important for cooperation and coordination among the agents. By employing reinforcement learning (RL) methods in a fuzzified state-space, we accomplish to design a control architecture and a corresponding methodology, engaged in a continuous space, which enables the agents to learn, over a period of time, to perform sequences of continuous actions in a cooperative manner, in order to reach their goal without any prior generated task model. By organizing the agents in a nested architecture, as proposed in this work, a type of problem-specific recursive knowledge acquisition is attempted. Furthermore, the agents try to exploit the knowledge gathered in order to be in position to execute tasks that indicate certain degree of similarity. The agents correspond in fact to independent degrees of freedom of the system, and achieve to gain experience over the task that they collaboratively perform, by exploring and exploiting their state-to-action mapping space.

They are equipped with differentiable geometric operations, such as projection, unprojection, egomotion estimation and stabilization, in order to compute a geometrically-consistent mapping between the world scene and their 3D latent feature space. We train the proposed architectures to predict novel image views given short frame sequences as input. Their predictions strongly generalize to scenes with a novel number of objects, appearances and configurations, and greatly outperform predictions of previous works that do not consider egomotion stabilization or a space-aware latent feature space. We train the proposed architectures to detect and segment objects in 3D, using the latent 3D feature map as input-as opposed to 2D feature maps computed from video frames. The resulting detections are permanent: they continue to exist even when an object gets occluded or leaves the field of view.

However, current VLN agents simply store their past experiences/observations as latent states in recurrent networks, failing to capture environment layouts and make long-term planning. To address these limitations, we propose a crucial architecture, called Structured Scene Memory (SSM). It is compartmentalized enough to accurately memorize the percepts during navigation. It also serves as a structured scene representation, which captures and disentangles visual and geometric cues in the environment. SSM has a collect-read controller that adaptively collects information for supporting current decision making and mimics iterative algorithms for long-range reasoning. As SSM provides a complete action space, i.e., all the navigable places on the map, a frontier-exploration based navigation decision making strategy is introduced to enable efficient and global planning.

As it does so, it accumulates knowledge, learns new attack sequences and improves its own internal penetration testing logic. As a result, this agent (AgentPen for simplicity) is able to successfully penetrate hosts it has never interacted with before. A computer security administrator using this tool would receive a comprehensive, automated sequence of actions leading to a security breach, highlighting potential vulnerabilities, and reducing the amount of menial tasks a typical penetration tester would need to execute.

10.1109/DASC.2017.8102124,AIAA/IEEE Digital Avionics Systems Conference - Proceedings,"Within human factors there is burgeoning interest in the ""human-autonomy teaming"" (HAT) concept as a way to address the challenges of interacting with complex, increasingly autonomous systems. The HAT concept comes out of an aspiration to interact with increasingly autonomous systems as a team member, rather than simply use automation as a tool. The authors, and others, have proposed core tenets for HAT that include bi-directional communication, automation and system transparency, and advanced coordination between human and automated teammates via predefined, dynamic task sequences known as ""plays."" It is believed that, with proper implementation, HAT should foster appropriate teamwork, thus increasing trust and reliance on the system, which in turn will reduce workload, increase situation awareness, and improve performance. To this end, HAT has been demonstrated and/or studied in multiple applications including search and rescue operations, healthcare and medicine, autonomous vehicles, photography, and aviation. The current paper presents one such effort to apply HAT. It details the design of a HAT agent, developed by Human Automation Teaming Solutions, Inc., to facilitate teamwork between the automation and the human operator of an advanced ground dispatch station. This dispatch station was developed to support a NASA project investigating a concept called Reduced Crew Operations (RCO); consequently, we have named the agent R-HATS. Part of the RCO concept involves a ground operator providing enhanced support to a large number of aircraft with a single pilot on the flight deck. When assisted by R-HATS, operators can monitor and support or manage a large number of aircraft and use plays to respond in real-time to complicated, workload-intensive events (e.g., an airport closure). A play is a plan that encapsulates goals, tasks, and a task allocation strategy appropriate for a particular situation. In the current implementation, when a play is initiated by a user, R-HATS determines what tasks need to be completed and has the ability to autonomously execute them (e.g., determining diversion options and uplinking new routes to aircraft) when it is safe and appropriate. R-HATS has been designed to both support end users and researchers in RCO and HAT. Additionally, R-HATS and its underlying architecture were developed with generaliz ability in mind as a modular software applicable outside of RCO/aviation domains. This paper will also discuss future further development and testing of R-HATS. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Given the expected huge number of drones, if they were operated by human pilots, the possibility to collide with each other could be too high. In this paper, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) architecture is proposed to make drones behave autonomously inside a suburb neighborhood environment. The environment in the simulator has plenty of obstacles such as trees, cables, parked cars and houses. In addition, there are also another drones, acting as moving obstacles, inside the environment while the learner drone has a goal to achieve. In this way the drone can be trained to detect stationary and moving obstacles inside the neighborhood and so the drones can be used safely in a public area in the future. The drone has a front camera and it can capture continuously depth images. Every depth image is part of the state used in DRL architecture. Also, another part of the state is the distance to the geo-fence (a virtual barrier on the environment) which is added as a scalar value. The agent will be rewarded negatively when it tries to overpass the geo-fence limits. In addition, angle to goal and elevation angle between the goal and the drone will be used as information to be added to the state. It is considered that these scalar values will improve the DRL performance and also the reward obtained. The drone is trained using Q-Network and its convergence and final reward are evaluated. The states containing image and several scalars are processed by a neural network that joints the two state parts into a unique flow. This neural network is named as Joint Neural Network (JNN) [1]. The training and test results show that the agent can successfully learn to avoid any obstacle in the environment. The results for three scenarios are very promising and the learner drone reaches the destination with a success rate 100% in first two tests and with a success rate 98% in the last test, this one with a total of three drones. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

As a result, the users and also the engineers who developed the AI algorithms have a hard time explaining how the AI model gives the specific result. This phenomenon is known as ""black box""and affects end-users' confidence in these AI systems. In this research, explainability of deep reinforcement learning is investigated for counter-drone systems. To counter a drone, a deep reinforcement learning method such as double deep Q-network with dueling architecture and prioritized experience replay is proposed. In counter-drone systems, catching the target as soon as possible is expected. Otherwise, the target can be gone in a short time. To understand how the agent performs more quickly and accurately, figures representing rewards, drone locations, crash positions, and the distribution of actions are analyzed and compared. For example, the positions of the drones in a successful episode during training can be analyzed by the actions the agent performed and the rewards in this episode. In addition, the actions agent took in episodes are compared with action frequencies during training and it is seen that at the end of the training, the agent selects the dominant actions throughout the training. However, at the beginning of the training, the distribution of actions is not correlated with the actions selected at the end. The results showed that the agent uses different flight paths by using different actions to catch the target drone in different episodes and different models. Finally, the generation of a saliency map is investigated to identify the critical regions in an input image which influences the predictions made by the DQN agent by evaluating the gradients of the model's output with respect to both the image and scalar inputs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

At the same time, relatively bad experience is forgotten to remove its confusing effect. We set up a layer-wise deep actor-critic architecture and apply the self-reflection process to help to train it. We show that the self-reflective model seems to work well and initial experimental result on real robot shows that the agent accomplished good success rate in reaching a goal location. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Our architecture learns to dynamically construct plans using a learned state-transition model by selecting and traversing between simulated states and actions to maximize information before acting. DPN learns to efficiently form plans by expanding a single action-conditional state transition at a time instead of exhaustively evaluating each action, reducing the number of state-transitions used during planning. We observe emergent planning patterns in our agent, including classical search methods such as breadth-first and depth-first search.

10.1109/IROS.2013.6696343,IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems,"Cooperation1 is at the core of human social life. In this context, two major challenges face research on humanrobot interaction: the first is to understand the underlying structure of cooperation, and the second is to build, based on this understanding, artificial agents that can successfully and safely interact with humans. Here we take a psychologically grounded and human-centered approach that addresses these two challenges. We test the hypothesis that optimal cooperation between a naïve human and a robot requires that the robot can acquire and execute a joint plan, and that it communicates this joint plan through ecologically valid modalities including spoken language, gesture and gaze. We developed a cognitive system that comprises the human-like control of social actions, the ability to acquire and express shared plans and a spoken language stage. In order to test the psychological validity of our approach we tested 12 naïve subjects in a cooperative task with the robot. We experimentally manipulated the presence of a joint plan (vs. a solo plan), the use of task-oriented gaze and gestures, and the use of language accompanying the unfolding plan. The quality of cooperation was analyzed in terms of proper turn taking, collisions and cognitive errors. Results showed that while successful turn taking could take place in the absence of the explicit use of a joint plan, its presence yielded significantly greater success. One advantage of the solo plan was that the robot would always be ready to generate actions, and could thus adapt if the human intervened at the wrong time, whereas in the joint plan the robot expected the human to take his/her turn. Interestingly, when the robot represented the action as involving a joint plan, gaze provided a highly potent nonverbal cue that facilitated successful collaboration and reduced errors in the absence of verbal communication. These results support the cooperative stance in human social cognition, and suggest that cooperative robots should employ joint plans, fully communicate them in order to sustain effective collaboration while being ready to adapt if the human makes a midstream mistake. © 2013 IEEE. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

However, these architectures fail to address scalability problems, when distributed tasks requiring the employment of itinerant agents is considered. This is because they lack mechanisms that guarantee optimization of agents' itineraries so as to minimize the total migration cost in terms of the round-trip latency and the incurred traffic. This is of particular importance when MAs itineraries span multiple subnets. The work presented herein aspires to address these issues. To that end, we have designed and implemented an algorithm that adapts methods usually applied for addressing network design problems in the specific area of mobile agent itinerary planning. The algorithm not only suggests the optimal number of mobile agents that minimize the overall cost but also constructs optimal itineraries for each of them.

Since the soft actor-critic algorithm with feedforward networks did not work satisfactorily in this scenario, we propose instead a parameterization with a recurrent neural network architecture to successfully handle spot-market price data. The past is encoded into a hidden state, which provides a way to learn the temporal dependencies in the observations and highly volatile rewards.

However, the high computational demands of AI tasks contrast sharply with the limited computing resources available in industrial environments, highlighting the need for efficient task offloading strategies. This paper addresses AI task offloading under resource-constrained IIoT scenarios by proposing LSTM-Enhanced Hierarchical-Classification Offloading with DQN (LHC-DQN). The proposed framework adopts a two-layer offloading architecture: the first layer performs global scheduling by assigning tasks to cloud, edge, or device resources, while the second layer refines the allocation. Cloud and edge nodes apply mathematical optimization, whereas device nodes leverage DRL agents for autonomous decision-making. To handle AI task heterogeneity, a classification-aware mechanism is introduced in the first layer, deploying separate DQN agents for inference and training tasks to improve adaptability and efficiency. Furthermore, an LSTM module is integrated into the DQN backbone to capture temporal dependencies in task states. Experimental results in a simulated environment demonstrate that LHC-DQN significantly outperforms traditional methods, increasing task completion rates from approximately 47% to 68%. Ablation and generalization tests further confirm the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method. Overall, LHC-DQN offers a practical and efficient solution for intelligent task offloading and resource scheduling in IIoT environments.",

It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the 'softwarization' of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT.

Although reactive neural networks easily learn expert behaviors and are computationally efficient, they suffer from generalization of policies learned in specific environments. As such, reinforcement learning and value iteration approaches for learning generalized policies have been proposed. However, these approaches are more costly. In this letter, we tackle the problem of learning reactive neural networks that are applicable to general environments. The key concept is to crop, rotate, and rescale an obstacle map according to the goal location and the agent's current location so that the map representation will be better correlated with self-movement in the general navigation task, rather than the layout of the environment. Furthermore, in addition to the obstacle map, we input a map of visited locations that contains the movement history of the agent, in order to avoid failures that the agent travels back and forth repeatedly over the same location. Experimental results reveal that the proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art value iteration network in the grid-world navigation task. We also demonstrate that the proposed model can be well generalized to unseen obstacles and unknown terrain. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed system enables a mobile robot to successfully navigate in a real dynamic environment.",

10.1109/LRA.2019.2931825,A Framework for Automatic Initialization of Multi-Agent Production Systems Using Semantic Web Technologies,"Mass customization and global competition require Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems (CPSoS) to become increasingly flexible. Modern CPSoS have to be able to create a wide and versatile variety of products, which takes centralized approaches to their limits. In addition, they have to produce these products as quickly as possible. Hence, they must be able to react promptly if problems arise, such as the failure of a single machine. Modern agent-based production systems provide the flexibility required to cope with these challenges. While resource agents (RAs) represent the available resources, i.e., machines, such as robots, individual customer orders can be represented by so-called product agents (PAs). However, a challenge in the design of agent-based production systems is still the amount of communication and computation that is necessary online. The PAs have to communicate their requests and the RAs their capabilities and capacities. On this basis, PAs must compute the appropriate production sequence. We propose to automatically initialize every agent with a knowledge base (KB) created a priori using semantic web technologies (SWT). On the one hand, the KBs of RAs describe the RAs’ capabilities in terms of product features and production processes. Every KB of a PA, on the other hand, expresses all possible production sequences based on the customer specification and the CPSoS in question. This allows consistency checks regarding the specification as well as more purposeful communication that focuses on aspects that actually need to be determined at runtime, such as the resources’ current capacities or failures.

Current state-of-the-art methods employ a dense extrinsic reward that requires the complete a priori knowledge of the layout of the training environment to learn an effective exploration policy. However, such information is expensive to gather in terms of time and resources. In this work, we propose to train the model with a purely intrinsic reward signal to guide exploration, which is based on the impact of the robot's actions on its internal representation of the environment. So far, impact-based rewards have been employed for simple tasks and in procedurally generated synthetic environments with countable states. Since the number of states observable by the agent in realistic indoor environments is non-countable, we include a neural-based density model and replace the traditional count-based regularization with an estimated pseudo-count of previously visited states. The proposed exploration approach outperforms DRL-based competitors relying on intrinsic rewards and surpasses the agents trained with a dense extrinsic reward computed with the environment layouts.

However, for systems like hexapod robots, which feature a higher-dimensional action space, it remains challenging for an agent to devise an effective control strategy directly. Currently, no hexapod robots have demonstrated highly dynamic motion. To address this, we propose imitation-enhanced reinforcement learning (IERL), a two-stage approach enabling hexapod robots to achieve dynamic motion through direct control using RL methods. Initially, imitation learning (IL) replicates a basic positional control method, creating a pre-trained policy for basic locomotion. Subsequently, the parameters from this model are utilized as the starting point for the reinforcement learning process to train the agent. Moreover, we incorporate a smooth transition (ST) method to make IERL overcome the changes in network inputs between two stages, and adaptable to various complex network architectures incorporating latent features.

The context itself can be static (lanes, regulatory elements, etc) or dynamic (traffic participants). This letter presents a lane graph-based motion prediction model that first predicts graph-based goal proposals and later fuses them with cross attention over multiple contextual elements. We follow the famous encoder-interactor-decoder architecture where the encoder encodes scene context using lightweight Gated Recurrent Units, the interactor applies cross-context attention over encoded scene features and graph goal proposals, and the decoder regresses multimodal trajectories via Laplacian Mixture Density Network from the aggregated encodings. Using cross-attention over graph-based goal proposals gives robust trajectory estimates since the model learns to attend to future goal-relevant scene elements for the intended agent. We evaluate our work on nuScenes motion prediction dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Usually, the reward signal is a «hand-crafted» numerical value or a pre-defined function: it tells the agent how good or bad a specific action is. However, we believe there exist situations in which the environment cannot directly provide such a reward signal to the agent. Therefore, the question is whether an agent can still learn without the external reward signal or not. To this end, this article develops a self-learning approach which enables the agent to adaptively develop an internal reward signal based on a given ultimate goal, without requiring an explicit external reward signal from the environment. In this article, we aim to convey the self-learning idea in a broad sense, which could be used in a wide range of existing reinforcement learning and adaptive dynamic programming algorithms and architectures.

These technologies can reduce demands for human workload while enabling a suite of new capabilities such as autonomous vehicles and smart cities. However, a major challenge is the integration of these autonomous systems into a system of systems (SoSs), essentially resulting in a system of autonomous systems (SoASs). SoASs are fraught with new challenges that compound issues from the founding domains of SoS, AI/ML, and autonomous systems. To understand the new set of challenges for SoAS, this article conducts an extensive review of both theoretical and application-based literature published in the founding domains. The goal is to examine how individual challenges in each domain intersect and exacerbate when multiple independent systems with AI/ML are integrated into an SoAS. A particular emphasis is placed on highlighting how interactions across these domains manifest at the SoAS level. As a result, four overarching challenges for SoASs are identified that must be addressed by systems engineers to ensure a successful realization of the SoAS in the future: 1) SoAS foundation; 2) emergence, safety, and performance; 3) architecture and integration; and 4) test and evaluation.

Our work presents a new framework of developmental skill learning process by introducing a hierarchical nested multi-agent architecture. A neuro-dynamic learning mechanism employing function approximators in a fuzzified state-space is utilized, leading to a collaborative control scheme among the distributed agents engaged in a continuous space, which enables the multi-agent system to learn, over a period of time, how to perform sequences of continuous actions in a cooperative manner without any prior task model. The agents comprising the system manage to gain experience over the task that they collaboratively perform by continuously exploring and exploiting their state-to-action mapping space. For the specific problem setting, the proposed theoretical framework is employed in the case of two simulated e-Puck robots performing a collaborative box-pushing task. This task involves active cooperation between the robots in order to jointly push an object on a plane to a specified goal location. We should note that 1) there are no contact points specified for the two e-Pucks and 2) the shape of the object is indifferent. The actuated wheels of the mobile robots are considered as the independent agents that have to build up cooperative skills over time, in order for the robot to demonstrate intelligent behavior.

Current DST approaches rely on a predefined domain ontology, a fact that limits their effective usage for large scale conversational agents, where the DST constantly needs to be interfaced with ever-increasing services and APIs. Focused towards overcoming this drawback, we propose a domain-aware dialogue state tracker, that is completely data-driven and it is modeled to predict for dynamic service schemas, including zero-shot domains. Unlike approaches that propose separate models for prediction of intents, requested slots, slot status, categorical slots and non-categorical slots, we propose a single model in an end-to-end architecture. The proposed model utilizes domain and slot information to extract both domain and slot specific representations from a given dialogue, and then uses such representations to predict the values of the corresponding slot in a given domain. Integrating this mechanism with pretrained language models, our approach can effectively learn semantic relations and effectively perform transfer learning between domains or zero-shot tracking for domains not present in training. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

As these agents proliferate across virtual and physical environments, from virtual assistants to embodied robots, the need for a unified, agent‑centric infrastructure becomes paramount. In this survey, we introduce the Internet of Agents (IoA) as a foundational framework that enables seamless interconnection, dynamic discovery, and collaborative orchestration among heterogeneous agents at scale. We begin by presenting a general IoA architecture, highlighting its hierarchical organization, distinguishing features relative to the traditional Internet, and emerging applications. Next, we analyze the key operational enablers of IoA, including capability notification and discovery, adaptive communication protocols, dynamic task matching, consensus and conflict‑resolution mechanisms, and incentive models. Finally, we identify open research directions toward building resilient and trustworthy IoA ecosystems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Efficient task offloading can leverage MEC technology to reduce task processing latency and energy consumption. By integrating the reasoning ability and machine intelligence of the cognitive computing architecture, such as SOAR and ACT-R, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been applied to resolve the task offloading in MEC. To solve the problem that conventional deep RL (DRL) algorithms cannot adapt to dynamic environments, this article proposed a task offloading scheduling strategy which combined multiagent RL and meta-learning. In order to make the two actions of charging time and offloading strategy fully considered at the same time, we implemented a learning network of two agents on an MD. To efficiently train the policy network, we proposed a first-order approximation method based on the clipped surrogate objective. Finally, the experiments are designed with a variety of the number of subtasks, transmission rate, and edge server performance, and the results show that the MRL-based strategy has the overwhelming overall performance and can be quickly applied in various environments with good stability and generalization.",

This leads to the thinking of how real intelligence could be created. Consciousness theories believe that general intelligence is essentially conscious, yet no universal definition is agreed upon. In this work, global workspace (GW) theory is implemented and integrated with crucial cognitive components. With the focus on episodic memory and inspiration from the nature of episodic memory in psychology and neuroscience, the episodic memory component is implemented within the GW framework. In our experiment, the robotic agent operates in a real-world interactive context, forming episodic memory and demonstrating static, temporal, and context memory capabilities during interactions. Consciousness in this work engages in all formation, maintenance, and retrieval processes of episodic memory. The novelty and contributions of this work are: 1) this work is implementing episodic memory within the consciousness framework, suggesting the sustainable potential of such an integrated approach to cognitive agents with artificial general intelligence (AGI); 2) regarding the limited examples in consciousness-based cognitive architectures, this work attempts to contribute to the diversity of perspectives and approaches; 3) extant episodic memory implementations are suffering from various limitations, while this work summarises some key features for modeling episodic memory within a cognitive architecture; and 4) authors discuss the relationship between episodic memory, consciousness, and general intelligence, proposing the compatibility and relationship between machine consciousness and other AGI research.

We consider that the communications are affected by time-varying delays and the vehicles lack velocity measurements. The desired control objective is that all the vehicles converge to a given desired formation and that they reach a consensus on the localization of the center of such formation and on their orientations. The control architecture exploits several features. From a control viewpoint, the systems’ dynamics are split into their angular-motion and linear-motion parts, so each of these is driven by a separate distributed dynamic output-feedback controller, passively interconnected to the plant via a virtual spring. From a network-topology viewpoint, the overall networked system contains two layers of interconnections with undirected graphs.

This is generally achieved by resorting to a server–worker architecture where agents iteratively update local models and communicate local parameters to a server that aggregates and returns them to the agents. However, the presence of adversarial agents, which may intentionally exchange malicious parameters or may have corrupted local datasets, can jeopardize the FL process. Therefore, we propose selective trimmed average (SETA), which is a resilient algorithm to cope with the undesirable effects of a number of misbehaving agents in the global model. SETA is based on properly filtering and combining the exchanged parameters. We mathematically prove that the proposed algorithm is resilient against data and local model poisoning attacks. Most resilient methods presented so far in the literature assume that a trusted server is in hand. In contrast, our algorithm works both in server–worker and shared memory architectures, where the latter excludes the necessity of a trusted server. The theoretical findings are corroborated through numerical results on MNIST dataset and on multiclass weather dataset (MWD).",

10.1109/TDSC.2022.3154585,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,"The stochastic multi-armed bandit is a classical reinforcement learning model, where a learning agent sequentially chooses an action (pull a bandit arm) and the environment responds with a stochastic reward drawn from an unknown distribution associated with the chosen action. A popular objective for the agent is to identify the arm having the maximum expected reward, also known as the best arm identification problem. We address the security concerns that occur in a cross-silo federated learning setting, where multiple data owners collaborate under the orchestration of a server to execute a best arm identification algorithm. We propose three secure protocols, which guarantee desirable security properties for the: input data (i.e., reward values), intermediate data (i.e., sums of rewards), and output data (i.e., ranking of arms and in particular the identified best arm). More precisely: (1) no data owner can learn the identified best arm; moreover, no data owner can learn local data pertaining to another data owner; (2) the orchestration participants cannot learn the identified best arm, any reward value, or any sum of rewards; (3) by analyzing the messages exchanged over the network, an external observer cannot learn the identified best arm, or any reward value, or any sum of rewards. Each protocol has a different architecture, uses different techniques, and proposes a different trade-off with respect to several criteria that we thoroughly analyze: number of participants, generality of the supported reward functions, cryptographic overhead, and communication cost. To build our protocols, we rely on secure multi-party computation, AES-CBC, and the additive homomorphic property of Paillier. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Specifically, to multi-agent systems, it will become more complicated owing to the state coupling problem in control design. In order to achieve the optimized control, the reinforcement learning algorithm of the identifier-actor-critic architecture is implemented based on fuzzy logic system (FLS) approximators. The identifier is designed for estimating the unknown multi-agent dynamics; the actor and critic FLSs are constructed for executing control behavior and evaluating control performance, respectively.

The goal of the framework is to learn situation-specific scheduling policies for reducing energy expenditure, while maintaining network performance in terms of packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay. The proposed system uses a cooperative RL approach where two learning agents, deployed per node, jointly learn transmit and sleep scheduling strategies to manage network energy budgets. The RL framework also uses a localized learning confidence parameter sharing strategy that allows the nodes to ignore unreliable RL observations. This makes the system scalable for network topologies where the source and destination nodes are separated by many numbers of hops. The learning module is decentralized in that learning is independently carried out at the sensor/IoT nodes without relying on a central learning coordinator. Decentralized learning makes the system computationally efficient, and also avoids energy and communication bandwidth overhead usually imposed by a central coordinator. With simulation studies, the proposed learning-driven protocol is tested and compared against existing known MAC sleep schedulers. The proposed mechanism is validated for different scenarios with heterogeneous topologies, traffic, and energy harvesting conditions.",

A central processor evaluates the distribution system after a disruption and attains a restoration plan. However, the centralized operational paradigm is susceptible to single-point failures, requires full situational awareness of the distribution system, and poses scalability challenges for large multifeeder distribution systems. This motivates a distributed decision-making paradigm where multiple agents solve smaller subproblems and jointly coordinate their individual decisions to achieve the global/network-level objective. Toward this goal, we propose a layered architecture for distributed algorithms for resilience and a two-stage distributed algorithm for distribution system restoration.

10.1109/TIT.2022.3232368,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,"This work proposes a decentralized architecture, where individual agents aim at solving a classification problem while observing streaming features of different dimensions and arising from possibly different distributions. In the context of social learning, several useful strategies have been developed, which solve decision making problems through local cooperation across distributed agents and allow them to learn from streaming data. However, traditional social learning strategies rely on the fundamental assumption that each agent has significant prior knowledge of the underlying distribution of the observations. In this work we overcome this issue by introducing a machine learning framework that exploits social interactions over a graph, leading to a fully data-driven solution to the distributed classification problem. In the proposed social machine learning (SML) strategy, two phases are present: in the training phase, classifiers are independently trained to generate a belief over a set of hypotheses using a finite number of training samples; in the prediction phase, classifiers evaluate streaming unlabeled observations and share their instantaneous beliefs with neighboring classifiers. We show that the SML strategy enables the agents to learn consistently under this highly-heterogeneous setting and allows the network to continue learning even during the prediction phase when it is deciding on unlabeled samples. The prediction decisions are used to continually improve performance thereafter in a manner that is markedly different from most existing static classification schemes where, following training, the decisions on unlabeled data are not re-used to improve future performance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

This paper adopts a distributed multiagent-based approach to develop a traffic-responsive signal control system, i.e., the geometric fuzzy multiagent system (GFMAS), which is based on a geometric type-2 fuzzy inference system. GFMAS is capable of handling the various levels of uncertainty found in the inputs and rule base of the traffic signal controller.

In addition to enabling individuals to retain ownership of their data and to monetize it, the architecture is also suitable for distributed privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms, is lightweight, and can be implemented in simple internet-of-things (IoT) devices. To demonstrate its efficacy, we apply this framework to reinforcement learning settings where a third party is interested in acquiring information from agents. In particular, one may be interested in sampling an unknown vehicular traffic flow in a city, using a DLT-type architecture and without perturbing the density, with the idea of realizing a set of virtual tokens as surrogates of real vehicles to explore geographical areas of interest. These tokens, whose authenticated position determines write access to the ledger, are thus used to emulate the probing actions of commanded (real) vehicles on a given planned route by 'jumping' from a passing-by vehicle to another to complete the planned trajectory.

We introduce Inductive Graph Reinforcement Learning (IG-RL) based on graph-convolutional networks which adapts to the structure of any road network, to learn detailed representations of traffic signal controllers and their surroundings. Our decentralized approach enables learning of a transferable-adaptive-traffic-signal-control policy. After being trained on an arbitrary set of road networks, our model can generalize to new road networks and traffic distributions, with no additional training and a constant number of parameters, enabling greater scalability compared to prior methods.

Existing methods typically suffer from low computational efficiency and poor scalability, which hinder the appropriate applications in large-scale scenarios involving an increasing number of vehicles. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel decentralized iterative linear quadratic regulator (iLQR) algorithm by leveraging the dual consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). First, the original non-convex optimization problem is reformulated into a series of convex optimization problems through iterative neighbourhood approximation. Then, the dual of each convex optimization problem is shown to have a consensus structure, which facilitates the use of consensus ADMM to solve for the dual solution in a fully decentralized and parallel architecture. Finally, the primal solution corresponding to the trajectory of each vehicle is recovered by solving a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem iteratively, and a novel trajectory update strategy is proposed to ensure the dynamic feasibility of vehicles. With the proposed development, the computation burden is significantly alleviated such that real-time performance is attainable.

A proposed solution to this problem comes from collaborative perception via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, which leverages a diverse perspective thanks to the presence of connected agents (vehicles and intelligent roadside units) at multiple locations to form a complete scene representation. The major challenge of V2X collaboration is the performance-bandwidth tradeoff which presents two questions 1) which information should be exchanged over the V2X network and 2) how the exchanged information is fused. The current state-of-the-art resolves to the mid-collaboration approach where Birds-Eye View (BEV) images of point clouds are communicated to enable a deep interaction among connected agents while reducing bandwidth consumption. While achieving strong performance, the real-world deployment of most mid-collaboration approaches are hindered by their overly complicated architectures and unrealistic assumptions about inter-agent synchronization. In this work, we devise a simple yet effective collaboration method based on exchanging the outputs from each agent that achieves a better bandwidth-performance tradeoff while minimising the required changes to the single-vehicle detection models. Moreover, we relax the assumptions used in existing state-of-the-art approaches about inter-agent synchronization to only require a common time reference among connected agents, which can be achieved in practice using GPS time. Experiments on the V2X-Sim dataset show that our collaboration method reaches 76.72 mean average precision which is 99% the performance of the early collaboration method while consuming as much bandwidth as the late collaboration (0.01 MB on average).

Although the theoretical aspect of the pedagogical agents has been well-documented in literature, relatively fewer efforts have been made on how a pedagogical agent should be implemented in a real multimedia computerized simulation learning environment. In this paper, we propose a general purpose pedagogical agent architecture and implement it in the multimedia medical simulation Web-based learning system called health information network teaching system (HINTS) to further facilitate students' learning and thereby make the HINTS a more helpful educational tool. Our focus is the design of the general purpose pedagogical architecture and its implementation in a multimedia computerized simulation learning environment. A preliminary students' performance evaluation result is also reported. We analyzed how to evaluate the students' performance and how the hints were given by the pedagogical agent. The system has been installed in the National Cheng Kung University Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan for trial purposes. Some experiments have been conducted and the results have shown that the pedagogical agent indeed help the students in their learning process.",
10.1109/TLT.2014.2367493,A Self-Adaptive Multi-Agent System Approach for Collaborative Mobile Learning,"Mobile technologies have emerged as facilitators in the learning process, extending traditional classroom activities. However, engineering mobile learning applications for outdoor usage poses severe challenges. The requirements of these applications are challenging, as many different aspects need to be catered, such as resource access and sharing, communication between peers, group management, activity flow, etc. Robustness is particularly important for learning scenarios to guarantee undisturbed and smooth user experiences, pushing the technological aspects in the background. Despite significant research in the field of mobile learning, very few efforts have focused on collaborative mobile learning requirements from a software engineering perspective. This paper focuses on aspects of the software architecture, aiming to address the challenges related to resource sharing in collaborative mobile learning activities. This includes elements such as autonomy for personal interactive learning, richness for large group collaborative learning (indoor and outdoor), as well as robustness of the learning system. Additionally, we present self-adaptation as a solution to mitigate risks of resource unavailability and organization failures that arise from environment and system dynamism. Our evaluation provides indications regarding the system correctness with respect to resource sharing and collaboration concerns, and offers qualitative evidence of self-adaptation benefits for collaborative mobile learning applications.",
10.1109/TMC.2020.3017079,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,"The ubiquitous adoption of Internet-of-Things (IoT) based applications has resulted in the emergence of the Fog computing paradigm, which allows seamlessly harnessing both mobile-edge and cloud resources. Efficient scheduling of application tasks in such environments is challenging due to constrained resource capabilities, mobility factors in IoT, resource heterogeneity, network hierarchy, and stochastic behaviors. Existing heuristics and Reinforcement Learning based approaches lack generalizability and quick adaptability, thus failing to tackle this problem optimally. They are also unable to utilize the temporal workload patterns and are suitable only for centralized setups. However, asynchronous-advantage-actor-critic (A3C) learning is known to quickly adapt to dynamic scenarios with less data and residual recurrent neural network (R2N2) to quickly update model parameters. Thus, we propose an A3C based real-time scheduler for stochastic Edge-Cloud environments allowing decentralized learning, concurrently across multiple agents. We use the R2N2 architecture to capture a large number of host and task parameters together with temporal patterns to provide efficient scheduling decisions. The proposed model is adaptive and able to tune different hyper-parameters based on the application requirements. We explicate our choice of hyper-parameters through sensitivity analysis. The experiments conducted on real-world data set show a significant improvement in terms of energy consumption, response time, Service-Level-Agreement and running cost by 14.4, 7.74, 31.9, and 4.64 percent, respectively when compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1109/TMLCN.2023.3283228,Access Point Clustering in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Using Conventional and Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems consist of geographically-distributed multi-antenna access points (APs) that form a virtual massive MIMO array. To make the network arbitrarily scalable in size, each user should be served by the best possible personalized user-centric cluster of nearby APs. Unfortunately, determining that cluster is a combinatorially-complex problem made even harder when the users are in motion. Therefore, in this work, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm for AP selection and clustering. Each AP is an agent in the MARL algorithm and it is trained to near-optimally select for itself which users to serve. Conventional MARL algorithms require a centralized reward system to train the agents, and the agents’ neural network weights tend to strongly depend on their locations during training. To counteract these problems, we also consider a federated MARL framework. Simulation results demonstrate both our conventional and federated MARL algorithms outperform existing published AP selection algorithms, and also provide performance comparable to the case of all APs serving all users. The results also show the conventional algorithm has somewhat superior performance in the environment it was trained in, but the federated algorithm transfers its learning to changed environments much better, with very little performance loss.",
10.1109/TMLCN.2024.3365420,Buyers Collusion in Incentivized Forwarding Networks: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Study,"We present the issue of monetarily incentivized forwarding in a multi-hop mesh network architecture from an economic perspective. It is anticipated that credit-incentivized forwarding and relaying will be a simple method of exchanging transmission power and spectrum for connectivity. However, gateways and forwarding nodes, like any other free market, may create an oligopolistic market for the users they serve. In this study, a coalition scheme between buyers aims to address price control by gateways or nodes closer to gateways. In a Stackelberg competition game, buyer agents (users) and sellers (gateways) make decisions using reinforcement learning (RL), with decentralized Deep Q-Networks to buy and sell forwarding resources. We allow communication links between the buyers with a limited messaging space, without defining a collusion mechanism. The idea is to demonstrate that through messaging, and RL tacit collusion can emerge between agents in a decentralized setup. The multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) system is presented and analyzed from a machine-learning perspective. Moreover, MARL dynamics are discussed via mean field analysis to better understand divergence causes and make implementation recommendations for such systems. Finally, the simulation results show the results of coordination among the users.",

This work investigates bi-directional ROHC (BD-ROHC) integrated with a novel architecture of reinforcement learning (RL). We formulate a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), where the compressor is the POMDP agent, and the environment consists of the decompressor, channel, and header source. Our work adopts the well-known deep Q-network (DQN), which takes the history of actions and observations as inputs, and outputs the Q-values of corresponding actions. Compared with the ideal dynamic programming (DP) proposed in existing works, the newly proposed method is scalable to the state, action, and observation spaces. In contrast, DP often incurs formidable computation costs when the number of states becomes large due to long decompressor feedback delays and complex channel models. In addition, the new method does not require prior knowledge of the transition dynamics and accurate observation dependency of the model, which are often unavailable in practical applications.",
10.1109/TMLCN.2024.3501217,A2PC: Augmented Advantage Pointer-Critic Model for Low Latency on Mobile IoT With Edge Computing,"As a growing trend, edge computing infrastructures are starting to be integrated with Internet of Things (IoT) systems to facilitate time-critical applications. These systems often require the processing of data with limited usefulness in time, so the edge becomes vital in the development of such reactive IoT applications with real-time requirements. Although different architectural designs will always have advantages and disadvantages, mobile gateways appear to be particularly relevant in enabling this integration with the edge, particularly in the context of wide area networks with occasional data generation. In these scenarios, mobility planning is necessary, as aspects of the technology need to be aligned with the temporal needs of an application. The nature of this planning problem makes cutting-edge deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques useful in solving pertinent issues, such as having to deal with multiple dimensions in the action space while aiming for optimum levels of system performance. This article presents a novel scalable DRL model that incorporates a pointer-network (Ptr-Net) and an actor-critic algorithm to handle complex action spaces. The model synchronously determines the gateway location and visit time. Ultimately, the gateways are able to attain high-quality trajectory planning with reduced latency.",
10.1109/TMLCN.2024.3521876,Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning With Action Masking for UAV-Enabled Mobile Communications,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used as aerial base stations to provide ad hoc communications infrastructure. Building upon prior research efforts which consider either static nodes, 2D trajectories or single UAV systems, this paper focuses on the use of multiple UAVs for providing wireless communication to mobile users in the absence of terrestrial communications infrastructure. In particular, we jointly optimize UAV 3D trajectory and NOMA power allocation to maximize system throughput. Firstly, a weighted K-means-based clustering algorithm establishes UAV-user associations at regular intervals. Then the efficacy of training a novel Shared Deep Q-Network (SDQN) with action masking is explored. Unlike training each UAV separately using DQN, the SDQN reduces training time by using the experiences of multiple UAVs instead of a single agent. We also show that SDQN can be used to train a multi-agent system with differing action spaces. Simulation results confirm that: 1) training a shared DQN outperforms a conventional DQN in terms of maximum system throughput (+20%) and training time (-10%); 2) it can converge for agents with different action spaces, yielding a 9% increase in throughput compared to Mutual DQN algorithm; and 3) combining NOMA with an SDQN architecture enables the network to achieve a better sum rate compared with existing baseline schemes.",
10.1109/TMM.2025.3543110,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,"Learning from experience is a fundamental capability of intelligent agents. Autonomous systems rely on sensors that provide data about the environment and internal situations to their perception systems for learning and inference mechanisms. These systems can also learn Self-Aware and Situation-Aware generative modules from these data to localize themselves and interact with the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-aware cognitive architecture capable to perform tasks where the interactions between the self-state of an agent and the surrounding environment are explicitly and dynamically represented. We specifically develop a Deep Learning (DL) based Self-Aware interaction model, empowered by learning from Multi-Modal Perception (MMP) and World Models using multi-sensory data in a novel Multi-Agent Self-Awareness Architecture (MASAA). Two sub-modules are developed, the Situation Model (SM) and the First-Person model (FPM), that address different and interrelated aspects of the World Model (WM). The MMP model, instead, aims at learning the mapping of different sensory perceptions into Exteroceptive (EI) and Proprioceptive (PI) latent information. The WM then uses the learned MMP model as experience to predict dynamic self-behaviors and interaction patterns within the experienced environment. WM and MMP Models are learned in a data-driven way, starting from the lower-dimensional odometry data used to guide the learning of higher-dimensional video data, thus generating coupled Generalized State Hierarchical Dynamic Bayesian Networks (GS-HDBNs). We test our model on KITTI, CARLA, and iCab datasets, achieving high performance and a low average localization error (RMSE) of 2.897%, when considering two interacting agents. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2891792,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,"One of the main concerns of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is the data inefficiency problem, which stems both from an inability to fully utilize data acquired and from naive exploration strategies. In order to alleviate these problems, we propose a DRL algorithm that aims to improve data efficiency via both the utilization of unrewarded experiences and the exploration strategy by combining ideas from unsupervised auxiliary tasks, intrinsic motivation, and hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). Our method is based on a simple HRL architecture with a metacontroller and a subcontroller. The subcontroller is intrinsically motivated by the metacontroller to learn to control aspects of the environment, with the intention of giving the agent: 1) a neural representation that is generically useful for tasks that involve manipulation of the environment and 2) the ability to explore the environment in a temporally extended manner through the control of the metacontroller. In this way, we reinterpret the notion of pixel- and feature-control auxiliary tasks as reusable skills that can be learned via an intrinsic reward. We evaluate our method on a number of Atari 2600 games. We found that it outperforms the baseline in several environments and significantly improves performance in one of the hardest games - Montezuma's revenge - for which the ability to utilize sparse data is key. We found that the inclusion of intrinsic reward is crucial for the improvement in the performance and that most of the benefit seems to be derived from the representations learned during training. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Instead, actions are directly mapped onto the perceptual transitions that they bring about, eliminating the need for intermediate representation and significantly reducing training requirements.We here set out a very general learning framework for cognitive systems in which online learning of the P-A mapping may be conducted within a symbolic processing context, so that complex contextual reasoning can influence the P-A mapping. In utilizing a variational calculus approach to define a suitable objective function, the P-A mapping can be treated as an online learning problem via gradient descent using partial derivatives. Our central theoretical result is to demonstrate top-down modulation of low-level perceptual confidences via the Jacobian of the higher levels of a subsumptive P-A hierarchy. Thus, the separation of the Jacobian as a multiplying factor between levels within the objective function naturally enables the integration of abstract symbolic manipulation in the form of fuzzy deductive logic into the P-A mapping learning. We experimentally demonstrate that the resulting framework achieves significantly better accuracy than using P-A learning without top-down modulation. We also demonstrate that it permits novel forms of context-dependent multilevel P-A mapping, applying the mechanism in the context of an intelligent driver assistance system. © 2012 IEEE. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

This perspective on mind is described primarily in terms of the niche space of control states and the design space of processes that may support such phenomena. A developing agent architecture, that can support motivation and other control states associated with mind, is presented. Different aspects of agent research are discussed in terms of three categories of agents. Each agent category is characterized primarily in terms of their task-related competencies and internal behaviours and discussed in terms of our taxonomy of control states. The concept of complete agents is then introduced. Goals are described in terms of their generation across a number of computational layers. Experimental analysis is provided on how these differing forms of behaviours can be cleanly integrated.

10.1111/cogs.12390,Cognitive Science,"Most theories of learning would predict a gradual acquisition and refinement of skills as learning progresses, and while some highlight exponential growth, this fails to explain why natural cognitive development typically progresses in stages. Models that do span multiple developmental stages typically have parameters to “switch” between stages. We argue that by taking an embodied view, the interaction between learning mechanisms, the resulting behavior of the agent, and the opportunities for learning that the environment provides can account for the stage-wise development of cognitive abilities. We summarize work relevant to this hypothesis and suggest two simple mechanisms that account for some developmental transitions: neural readiness focuses on changes in the neural substrate resulting from ongoing learning, and perceptual readiness focuses on the perceptual requirements for learning new tasks. Previous work has demonstrated these mechanisms in replications of a wide variety of infant language experiments, spanning multiple developmental stages. Here we piece this work together as a single model of ongoing learning with no parameter changes at all.

10.1111/cogs.12775,Cognitive Science,"Human vision supports social perception by efficiently detecting agents and extracting rich information about their actions, goals, and intentions. Here, we explore the cognitive architecture of perceived animacy by constructing Bayesian models that integrate domain-specific hypotheses of social agency with domain-general cognitive constraints on sensory, memory, and attentional processing. Our model posits that perceived animacy combines a bottom–up, feature-based, parallel search for goal-directed movements with a top–down selection process for intent inference. The interaction of these architecturally distinct processes makes perceived animacy fast, flexible, and yet cognitively efficient. In the context of chasing, in which a predator (the “wolf”) pursues a prey (the “sheep”), our model addresses the computational challenge of identifying target agents among varying numbers of distractor objects, despite a quadratic increase in the number of possible interactions as more objects appear in a scene. By comparing modeling results with human psychophysics in several studies, we show that the effectiveness and efficiency of human perceived animacy can be explained by a Bayesian ideal observer model with realistic cognitive constraints. These results provide an understanding of perceived animacy at the algorithmic level—how it is achieved by cognitive mechanisms such as attention and working memory, and how it can be integrated with higher-level reasoning about social agency. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1111/cogs.13069,Cognitive Science,"One of the great challenges in word learning is that words are typically uttered in a context with many potential referents. Children's tendency to associate novel words with novel referents, which is taken to reflect a mutual exclusivity (ME) bias, forms a useful disambiguation mechanism. We study semantic learning in pragmatic agents-combining the Rational Speech Act model with gradient-based learning-and explore the conditions under which such agents show an ME bias. This approach provides a framework for investigating a pragmatic account of the ME bias in humans but also for building artificial agents that display an ME bias. A series of analyses demonstrates striking parallels between our model and human word learning regarding several aspects relevant to the ME bias phenomenon: online inference, long-term learning, and developmental effects. By testing different implementations, we find that two components, pragmatic online inference and incremental collection of evidence for one-to-one correspondences between words and referents, play an important role in modeling the developmental trajectory of the ME bias. Finally, we outline an extension of our model to a deep neural network architecture that can process more naturalistic visual and linguistic input. Until now, in contrast to children, deep neural networks have needed indirect access to (supposed to be novel) test inputs during training to display an ME bias.

10.1111/exsy.13315,Expert Systems,"Rail freight planning problems pose specific challenges that have attracted the attention of academics and industry professionals for many decades. They involve multiple types of assets (trains, stations, terminals, etc.) and are subjected to structural, operational and safety constraints. Even though various approaches have been proposed, few can address the complexity and size of real-world scenarios, and decentralized techniques, like multi-agent systems (MAS), have become more prevalent. The current state of the art in disciplines such as agent technology, reinforcement learning and discrete-event simulation allows the implementation of complex architectures, with multiple actors interacting and learning simultaneously. Therefore, this study takes advantage of these current advances and proposes an innovative approach to real-time traffic management problems in freight railway networks through multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL). This study was motivated by the decision-making scheduling problems arising in the Hunter Valley Coal Chain (HVCC), located in New South Wales, Australia. The MADRL algorithm uses as the training environment the simulation model currently utilized for capacity planning of the HVCC, allowing experiments with actual data. Thus, we enhanced the simulation model to accommodate a MAS with intelligent agents representing system elements, such as trains, dump stations, and load points. Furthermore, these agents act in a decentralized fashion based on local observations, constituting a partially-observed Markov decision process (dec-POMDP). Three variations of the MADRL approach are presented: a baseline model, an extended model, and one that directly addresses deadlocks. Finally, we present a transfer learning method that improves deadlock resolution and leverages performance. In the experiments, we explore specific, complex scenarios arising in the HVCC, where trains frequently face deadlock conditions. The baseline model outperforms a first-come-first-serve (FCFS) based heuristic used by HVCC's simulation model and a genetic algorithm in instances with up to 60 trains – but fails in more complex scenarios. On the other hand, the most advanced model, which addresses deadlocks via transfer learning, always finds feasible solutions and produces policies that outperform the FCFS-based heuristic in 94% of the instances. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1111/j.1467-8640.2012.00447.x,Computational Intelligence,"Algorithms for planning under uncertainty require accurate action models that explicitly capture the uncertainty of the environment. Unfortunately, obtaining these models is usually complex. In environments with uncertainty, actions may produce countless outcomes and hence, specifying them and their probability is a hard task. As a consequence, when implementing agents with planning capabilities, practitioners frequently opt for architectures that interleave classical planning and execution monitoring following a replanning when failure paradigm. Though this approach is more practical, it may produce fragile plans that need continuous replanning episodes or even worse, that result in execution dead-ends. In this paper, we propose a new architecture to relieve these shortcomings. The architecture is based on the integration of a relational learning component and the traditional planning and execution monitoring components. The new component allows the architecture to learn probabilistic rules of the success of actions from the execution of plans and to automatically upgrade the planning model with these rules. The upgraded models can be used by any classical planner that handles metric functions or, alternatively, by any probabilistic planner. This architecture proposal is designed to integrate off-the-shelf interchangeable planning and learning components so it can profit from the last advances in both fields without modifying the architecture. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

10.1111/tops.12252,Topics in Cognitive Science,"In line with Allen Newell's challenge to develop complete cognitive architectures, and motivated by a recent proposal for a unifying subsymbolic computational theory of cognition, we introduce the cognitive control architecture SEMLINCS. SEMLINCS models the development of an embodied cognitive agent that learns discrete production rule-like structures from its own, autonomously gathered, continuous sensorimotor experiences. Moreover, the agent uses the developing knowledge to plan and control environmental interactions in a versatile, goal-directed, and self-motivated manner. Thus, in contrast to several well-known symbolic cognitive architectures, SEMLINCS is not provided with production rules and the involved symbols, but it learns them. In this paper, the actual implementation of SEMLINCS causes learning and self-motivated, autonomous behavioral control of the game figure Mario in a clone of the computer game Super Mario Bros. Our evaluations highlight the successful development of behavioral versatility as well as the learning of suitable production rules and the involved symbols from sensorimotor experiences. Moreover, knowledge- and motivation-dependent individualizations of the agents’ behavioral tendencies are shown. Finally, interaction sequences can be planned on the sensorimotor-grounded production rule level. Current limitations directly point toward the need for several further enhancements, which may be integrated into SEMLINCS in the near future. Overall, SEMLINCS may be viewed as an architecture that allows the functional and computational modeling of embodied cognitive development, whereby the current main focus lies on the development of production rules from sensorimotor experiences. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1111/tops.12569,Topics in Cognitive Science,"We examine the mechanisms required to handle everyday activities from the standpoint of cognitive robotics, distinguishing activities on the basis of complexity and transparency. Task complexity (simple or complex) reflects the intrinsic nature of a task, while task transparency (easy or difficult) reflects an agent's ability to identify a solution strategy in a given task. We show how the CRAM cognitive architecture allows a robot to carry out simple and complex activities such as laying a table for a meal and loading a dishwasher afterward. It achieves this by using generalized action plans that exploit reasoning with modular, composable knowledge chunks representing general knowledge to transform underdetermined everyday action requests into motion plans that successfully accomplish the required task. Noting that CRAM does not yet have the ability to deal with difficult activities, we leverage insights from the situation model perspective on the cognitive mechanisms underlying flexible context-sensitive behavior with a view to extending CRAM to overcome this deficit. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1111/tops.12679,Topics in Cognitive Science,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered machines are increasingly mediating our work and many of our managerial, economic, and cultural interactions. While technology enhances individual capability in many ways, how do we know that the sociotechnical system as a whole, consisting of a complex web of hundreds of human–machine interactions, is exhibiting collective intelligence? Research on human–machine interactions has been conducted within different disciplinary silos, resulting in social science models that underestimate technology and vice versa. Bringing together these different perspectives and methods at this juncture is critical. To truly advance our understanding of this important and quickly evolving area, we need vehicles to help research connect across disciplinary boundaries. This paper advocates for establishing an interdisciplinary research domain—Collective Human-Machine Intelligence (COHUMAIN). It outlines a research agenda for a holistic approach to designing and developing the dynamics of sociotechnical systems. In illustrating the kind of approach, we envision in this domain, we describe recent work on a sociocognitive architecture, the transactive systems model of collective intelligence, that articulates the critical processes underlying the emergence and maintenance of collective intelligence and extend it to human–AI systems. We connect this with synergistic work on a compatible cognitive architecture, instance-based learning theory and apply it to the design of AI agents that collaborate with humans. We present this work as a call to researchers working on related questions to not only engage with our proposal but also develop their own sociocognitive architectures and unlock the real potential of human–machine intelligence. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

10.1111/tops.12705,Topics in Cognitive Science,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is often used to predict human behavior, thus potentially posing limitations to individuals’ and collectives’ freedom to act. AI's most controversial and contested applications range from targeted advertisements to crime prevention, including the suppression of civil disorder. Scholars and civil society watchdogs are discussing the oppressive dangers of AI being used by centralized institutions, like governments or private corporations. Some suggest that AI gives asymmetrical power to governments, compared to their citizens. On the other hand, civil protests often rely on distributed networks of activists without centralized leadership or planning. Civil protests create an adversarial tension between centralized and decentralized intelligence, opening the question of how distributed human networks can collectively adapt and outperform a hostile centralized AI trying to anticipate and control their activities. This paper leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning to simulate dynamics within a human–machine hybrid society. We ask how decentralized intelligent agents can collectively adapt when competing with a centralized predictive algorithm, wherein prediction involves suppressing coordination. In particular, we investigate an adversarial game between a collective of individual learners and a central predictive algorithm, each trained through deep Q-learning. We compare different predictive architectures and showcase conditions in which the adversarial nature of this dynamic pushes each intelligence to increase its behavioral complexity to outperform its counterpart. We further show that a shared predictive algorithm drives decentralized agents to align their behavior. This work sheds light on the totalitarian danger posed by AI and provides evidence that decentrally organized humans can overcome its risks by developing increasingly complex coordination strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1111/tops.12773,Topics in Cognitive Science,"Some of the required characteristics for a true machine theory of mind (MToM) include the ability to (1) reproduce the full diversity of human thought and behavior, (2) develop a personalized model of an individual with very limited data, and (3) provide an explanation for behavioral predictions grounded in the cognitive processes of the individual. We propose that a certain class of cognitive models provide an approach that is well suited to meeting those requirements. Being grounded in a mechanistic framework like a cognitive architecture such as ACT-R naturally fulfills the third requirement by mapping behavior to cognitive mechanisms. Exploiting a modeling paradigm such as instance-based learning accounts for the first requirement by reflecting variations in individual experience into a diversity of behavior. Mechanisms such as knowledge tracing and model tracing allow a specific run of the cognitive model to be aligned with a given individual behavior trace, fulfilling the second requirement. We illustrate these principles with a cognitive model of decision-making in a search and rescue task in the Minecraft simulation environment. We demonstrate that cognitive models personalized to individual human players can provide the MToM capability to optimize artificial intelligence agents by diagnosing the underlying causes of observed human behavior, projecting the future effects of potential interventions, and managing the adaptive process of shaping human behavior. Examples of the inputs provided by such analytic cognitive agents include predictions of cognitive load, probability of error, estimates of player self-efficacy, and trust calibration. Finally, we discuss implications for future research and applications to collective human–machine intelligence. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Such future missions will require increasing degrees of operational autonomy, especially when following up on transient events. Operational autonomy encompasses: (1) Automatic characterization of operational areas from different vantages (i.e., spaceborne, airborne, surface, subsurface); (2) automatic sensor deployment and data gathering; (3) automatic feature extraction including anomaly detection and region-of-interest identification; (4) automatic target prediction and prioritization; (5) and subsequent automatic (re-)deployment and navigation of robotic agents.

10.1117/12.3016311,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,"AI-enabled capabilities are reaching the requisite level of maturity to be deployed in the real world. Yet, the ability of these systems to always make correct or safe decisions is a constant source of criticism and reluctance to use them. One way of addressing these concerns is to leverage AI control systems alongside and in support of human decisions, relying on the AI control system in safe situations while calling on a human co-decider for critical situations. Additionally, by leveraging an AI control system built specifically to assist in joint human/machine decisions, the opportunity naturally arises to then use human interactions to continuously improve the AI control system's accuracy and robustness. We extend a methodology for adversarial explanations (AE) to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning frameworks, including MuZero. Multiple improvements to the base agent architecture are proposed. We demonstrate how this technology has two applications: for intelligent decision tools and to enhance training/learning frameworks. In a decision support context, adversarial explanations help a user make the correct decision by highlighting those contextual factors that would need to change for a different AI-recommended decision. As another benefit of adversarial explanations, we show that the learned AI control system demonstrates robustness against adversarial tampering. Additionally, we supplement AE by introducing strategically similar autoencoders (SSAs) to help users identify and understand all salient factors being considered by the AI system. In a training/learning framework, this technology can improve both the AI's decisions and explanations through human interaction. Finally, to identify when AI decisions would most benefit from human oversight, we tie this combined system to our prior art on statistically verified analyses of the criticality of decisions at any point in time. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Based on previous work concerning our robot control architecture HARPIC, we have developped a man machine interface and software components that allow a human operator to control a robot at different levels of autonomy. This work aims at studying how a robot could be helpful in indoor reconnaissance and surveillance missions in hostile environment. In such missions, since a soldier faces many threats and must protect himself while looking around and holding his weapon, he cannot devote his attention to the teleoperation of the robot. Moreover, robots are not yet able to conduct complex missions in a fully autonomous mode. Thus, in a pragmatic way, we have built a software that allows dynamic swapping betwen control modes (manual, safeguarded and behavior-based) while automatically performing map building and localization of the robot. It also includes surveillance functions like movement detection and is designed for multirobot extensions. We first describe the design of our agent-based robot control architecture and discuss the various ways to control and interact with a robot.The main modules and functionnalities implementing those ideas in our architecture are detailed. More precisely, we show how we combine manual controls, obstacle avoidance, wall and corridor following, way point and planned travelling.

The main aim of this competition is to develop an algorithm for the effective control of dense traffic in complex railroad networks according to a given schedule. The proposed solution is based on reinforcement learning. To adapt this method to the particular scheduling problem, a novel approach based on structuring the reward function that stimulates an agent to adhere to its schedule was developed. The architecture of the proposed model is based on a multiagent version of centralized critic with proximal policy optimization (PPO) learning. In addition, a curriculum learning strategy was developed and implemented. This allowed the agent to cope with each level of complexity on time and train the model in more difficult conditions. The proposed solution won first place in the Flatland 3 competition in the reinforcement learning track. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1142/S012906572350065X,International Journal of Neural Systems,"Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful technique that allows agents to learn optimal decision-making policies through interactions with an environment. However, traditional RL algorithms su®er from several limitations such as the need for large amounts of data and long-term credit assignment, i.e. the problem of determining which actions actually produce a certain reward. Recently, Transformers have shown their capacity to address these constraints in this area of learning in an o®line setting. This paper proposes a framework that uses Transformers to enhance the training of online o®-policy RL agents and address the challenges described above through self-attention. The proposal introduces a hybrid agent with a mixed policy that combines an online o®-policy agent with an o®line Transformer agent using the Decision Transformer architecture.

Existing independent searching methods may bring many users to ROIs simultaneously, such as popular attractions in scenic, and thus induce traffic jams. Therefore, it is necessary to find a personalized travel path considering the load balance of traffic flow. However, it is challenging to ensure load balancing on the road and ROIs while allowing each user to visit their ROIs. In this paper, we propose a personalized path-finding method with a multi-agent path-finding (MAPF) framework. Based on the MAPF, it allows users to find the path independently, and we designed a reward to guide the agent simultaneously to navigate to the destination and ROIs for personalized travel. We also improve the architecture of MAPF to guide the agents in learning the load balance through a centralized value network. We evaluated the algorithm with up to 1024 agents on randomly generated road network graphs and compared it against state-of-the-art MAPF planners. We also trained the agent using imitation learning and validated our framework on real-world datasets.

10.1142/S0219622018500086,International Journal of Information Technology and Decision Making,"Many robotic control architectures perform a continuous cycle of sensing, reasoning and acting, where that reasoning can be carried out in a reactive or deliberative form. Reactive methods are fast and provide the robot with high interaction and response capabilities. Deliberative reasoning is particularly suitable in robotic systems because it employs some form of forward projection (reasoning in depth about goals, pre-conditions, resources and timing constraints) and provides the robot reasonable responses in situations unforeseen by the designer. However, this reasoning, typically conducted using Artificial Intelligence techniques like Automated Planning (AP), is not effective for controlling autonomous agents which operate in complex and dynamic environments. Deliberative planning, although feasible in stable situations, takes too long in unexpected or changing situations which require re-planning. Therefore, planning cannot be done on-line in many complex robotic problems, where quick responses are frequently required. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach based on case-based policy learning which integrates deliberative reasoning through AP and reactive response time through reactive planning policies. The method is based on learning planning knowledge from actual experiences to obtain a case-based policy. The contribution of this paper is two fold. First, it is shown that the learned case-based policy produces reasonable and timely responses in complex environments. Second, it is also shown how one case-based policy that solves a particular problem can be reused to solve a similar but more complex problem in a transfer learning scope. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1142/S1752890921500239,Journal of Uncertain Systems,"Commonly used UAV emergency inspection methods are executed by the instructions of the ground command center. The response rate depends on the stability of the communication network and the rapid response ability of the commander. The critical time window is fleeting, which is likely to cause unnecessary loss. Crisis rapid response capability has become the key to measuring system capabilities. In order to improve the system's rapid response capability, a method of deploying decision-making agents on airborne computers and ground early warning systems is proposed. This early warning method uses key technologies such as multi-network integration, situation assessment, neural network architecture, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and intelligent cognitive reasoning to effectively ensure the effectiveness of crisis warning. The early warning method of the early warning system is as follows: the mission computer uniformly collects the flight control status parameters, the load status parameters and the load real-time data form a composite information flow. The task computer adopts the methods of protocol conversion, data classification, and danger recognition to the compound information flow to identify the crisis information and make a preliminary analysis and judgment of the crisis state. If it is determined that it is necessary to track the target in real time, the initial task assignment and parameter adjustment of the load are carried out, and the continuous tracking of the task target is carried out to realize the rapid response to the crisis on the edge side. At the same time, the composite data are downloaded to the command center. The command center performs the secondary crisis analysis and risk level determination and outputs the crisis plan deduced by the agent to realize the strategy assistance. The accuser refers to the plan strategy and issues instructions to the task computer, and the task computer receives it. Instruction and secondary adjustment and optimization of the load parameters. If there is a flight route adjustment instruction, the adjustment route will be sent to the flight controller, which greatly improves the flexibility and efficiency of handling the crisis in the UAV inspection process.

Furthermore, we utilize a composite deep neural network architecture for computing the factorized Q-function, share the model parameters among all the agents within the same group, and estimate the agents’ optimal joint actions through a coordinate descent type algorithm. All these simplifications greatly reduce the model complexity and accelerate the learning process.

Third, the desires block validates the goals the robot can reach; the goals are grouped in skills development, emotional control, cognitive control, challenge control, life signals, and immediate support. Fourth, the intentions block, based on the goals competition strategy, selects the goal that the robot will perform.

Namely, chatbot technologies intended for education should, by design, integrate directly within online learning applications and focus on achieving learning goals by supporting learners with the task at hand. In this paper, we propose a blueprint for an architecture specifically aimed at integrating task-oriented chatbots to support learners in educational contexts. We then present a proof-of-concept implementation of our blueprint as a part of a code review application designed to teach programming best practices. Our blueprint could serve as a starting point for developers in education looking to build chatbot technologies targeting educational contexts and is a first step toward an open chatbot architecture explicitly tailored for learning applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

10.1145/3572403,ACM Transactions on the Web,"Social bots are referred to as the automated accounts on social networks that make attempts to behave like humans. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been massively applied to the field of social bot detection, a huge amount of domain expertise and prior knowledge is heavily engaged in the state-of-the-art approaches to design a dedicated neural network architecture for a specific classification task. Involving oversized nodes and network layers in the model design, however, usually causes the over-smoothing problem and the lack of embedding discrimination. In this article, we propose RoSGAS, a novel Reinforced and Self-supervised GNN Architecture Search framework to adaptively pinpoint the most suitable multi-hop neighborhood and the number of layers in the GNN architecture. More specifically, we consider the social bot detection problem as a user-centric subgraph embedding and classification task. We exploit the heterogeneous information network to present the user connectivity by leveraging account metadata, relationships, behavioral features, and content features. RoSGAS uses a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL), 31 pages. mechanism for navigating the search of optimal neighborhood and network layers to learn individually the subgraph embedding for each target user. A nearest neighbor mechanism is developed for accelerating the RL training process, and RoSGAS can learn more discriminative subgraph embedding with the aid of self-supervised learning. Experiments on five Twitter datasets show that RoSGAS outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, training efficiency, and stability and has better generalization when handling unseen samples. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1145/3586183.3606763,,"Believable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive applications ranging from immersive environments to rehearsal spaces for interpersonal communication to prototyping tools. In this paper, we introduce generative agents: computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty-five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors. For example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent architecture - observation, planning, and reflection - each contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with computational interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Yet, various sequential interactive tasks, as in text-based games, have revealed limitations of existing approaches in terms of coherence, contextual awareness, and their ability to learn effectively from the environment. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-injection framework for improved functional grounding of agents in text-based games. Specifically, we consider two forms of domain knowledge that we inject into learning-based agents: memory of previous correct actions and affordances of relevant objects in the environment. Our framework supports two representative model classes: reinforcement learning agents and language model agents. Furthermore, we devise multiple injection strategies for the above domain knowledge types and agent architectures, including injection via knowledge graphs and augmentation of the existing input encoding strategies. We experiment with four models on the 10 tasks in the ScienceWorld text-based game environment, to illustrate the impact of knowledge injection on various model configurations and challenging task settings.

10.1145/3638529.3654213,,"Multiagent learning allows agents to learn cooperative behaviors necessary to accomplish team objectives. However, coordination requires agents to learn diverse behaviors that work well as part of a team, a task made more difficult by all agents simultaneously learning their own individual behaviors. This is made more challenging when there are multiple classes of asymmetric agents in the system with differing capabilities that work together as a team. The Asymmetric Island Model alleviates these difficulties by simultaneously optimizing for class-specific and team-wide behaviors as independent processes that enable agents to discover and refine optimal joint-behaviors. However, agents learn to optimize agent-specific behaviors in isolation from other agent classes, leading them to learn egocentric behaviors that are potentially sub-optimal when paired with other agent classes. This work introduces Reinforced Asymmetric Island Model (RAIM), a framework for explicitly reinforcing closely dependent inter-class agent behaviors. When optimizing the class-specific behaviors, agents learn alongside stationary representations of other classes, allowing them to efficiently optimize class-specific behaviors that are conditioned on the expectation of the behaviors of the complementary agent classes. Experiments in an asymmetric harvest environment highlight the effectiveness of our method in learning robust inter-agent behaviors that can adapt to diverse environment dynamics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

For this, a set of self-organizing maps which represent state-action pairs is combined with a causal model for sequence prediction. The proposed system is evaluated in the cartpole environment. After an initial phase of playful exploration, the agent can execute kinematic simulations of the environment's future and use those for action planning. We demonstrate its performance on a set of several related, but different one-shot imitation tasks, which the agent flexibly solves in an active inference style. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1155/2022/7839840,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,"Answer selection (AS) is a critical subtask of the open-domain question answering (QA) problem. The present paper proposes a method called RLAS-BIABC for AS, which is established on attention mechanism-based long short-term memory (LSTM) and the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) word embedding, enriched by an improved artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm for pretraining and a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for training backpropagation (BP) algorithm. BERT can be comprised in downstream work and fine-tuned as a united task-specific architecture, and the pretrained BERT model can grab different linguistic effects. Existing algorithms typically train the AS model with positive-negative pairs for a two-class classifier. A positive pair contains a question and a genuine answer, while a negative one includes a question and a fake answer. The output should be one for positive and zero for negative pairs. Typically, negative pairs are more than positive, leading to an imbalanced classification that drastically reduces system performance. To deal with it, we define classification as a sequential decision-making process in which the agent takes a sample at each step and classifies it. For each classification operation, the agent receives a reward, in which the prize of the majority class is less than the reward of the minority class. Ultimately, the agent finds the optimal value for the policy weights. We initialize the policy weights with the improved ABC algorithm. The initial value technique can prevent problems such as getting stuck in the local optimum. Although ABC serves well in most tasks, there is still a weakness in the ABC algorithm that disregards the fitness of related pairs of individuals in discovering a neighboring food source position. Therefore, this paper also proposes a mutual learning technique that modifies the produced candidate food source with the higher fitness between two individuals selected by a mutual learning factor. We tested our model on three datasets, LegalQA, TrecQA, and WikiQA, and the results show that RLAS-BIABC can be recognized as a state-of-the-art method. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Opportunities to improve the quality of service, save time and money triggered the widespread implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) based callbot. This article outlines the straightforward workflow developed to model the architecture of the callbot. Therefore, several algorithms were evaluated and compared based on real knowledge of a call center of an insurance society. The algorithms considered are: k-nearest neighbours (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forests (RF), logistic regression (LR), and Naïve Bayes (NB). The comparison criteria are: correct responses, response time, accuracy, Cohen’s kappa and F1 score using n-gram (1.1) and (2.2). The results obtained show that the SVM (accuracy=70.29%) presents the best results on all the comparison criteria. The comparison between the results of the human agents and the callbot shows an improvement in several levels: the cost savings are greater than 80% on all the tests carried out, the holding time decrease to 0 seconds, and the processing time (almost a third or more). The results obtained sufficiently meet the objectives of this project. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

In our research, we use international research results and the experience of the plant technologists to create three levels of distributed intelligent architecture: Business, production planning-control, and steel manufacturing. Each level manages to integrate and balance the particular and general interests for efficient decision-making combined between hierarchy and heterarchy in this steelwork plant, which will be reflected in a reduction of at least 99% of the time used for decision-making concerning the current system, which can lead to a decrease in refractory costs, energy consumption, and production cost.

Following that idea, this paper presents the ALEC agent architecture which has both emotive and cognitive learning, as well as emotive and cognitive decision-making capabilities to adapt to real-world environments. These two learning mechanisms embody very different properties which can be related to those of natural emotion and cognition systems.

10.1162/artl_a_00029,Artificial Life,"In some circumstances complex adaptive systems composed of numerous self-interested agents can self-organize into structures that enhance global adaptation, efficiency, or function. However, the general conditions for such an outcome are poorly understood and present a fundamental open question for domains as varied as ecology, sociology, economics, organismic biology, and technological infrastructure design. In contrast, sufficient conditions for artificial neural networks to form structures that perform collective computational processes such as associative memory/recall, classification, generalization, and optimization are well understood. Such global functions within a single agent or organism are not wholly surprising, since the mechanisms (e.g., Hebbian learning) that create these neural organizations may be selected for this purpose; but agents in a multi-agent system have no obvious reason to adhere to such a structuring protocol or produce such global behaviors when acting from individual self-interest. However, Hebbian learning is actually a very simple and fully distributed habituation or positive feedback principle. Here we show that when self-interested agents can modify how they are affected by other agents (e.g., when they can influence which other agents they interact with), then, in adapting these inter-agent relationships to maximize their own utility, they will necessarily alter them in a manner homologous with Hebbian learning. Multi-agent systems with adaptable relationships will thereby exhibit the same system-level behaviors as neural networks under Hebbian learning. For example, improved global efficiency in multi-agent systems can be explained by the inherent ability of associative memory to generalize by idealizing stored patterns and/or creating new combinations of subpatterns. Thus distributed multi-agent systems can spontaneously exhibit adaptive global behaviors in the same sense, and by the same mechanism, as the organizational principles familiar in connectionist models of organismic learning. © 2011 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

As such, there is a need for a more in-depth understanding of their resilience and robustness in conditions such as network partitions, node failures, or attacks. In this article, we propose a modeling and simulation framework that explores the resilience of four c-MARL models when faced with different types of attacks, and the impact that training with different perturbations has on the effectiveness of these attacks. We show that c-MARL approaches are highly vulnerable to perturbations of observation, action reward, and communication, showing more than 80% drop in the performance from the baseline. We also show that appropriate training with perturbations can dramatically improve performance in some cases, however, can also result in overfitting, making the models less resilient against other attacks.

However, these models typically fail to meet practical requirements like printability or manufacturability. In addition, current approaches often cannot accurately control the dimensions and the interrelations of elements within the generated 3D models. This presents a major challenge in utilizing ML-generated designs in real-world applications. To address this gap, we introduce a novel method for translating natural language descriptions into parametric 3D objects using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach employs multiple agents, each agent is LLM pre-trained for a specific task. The first agent deconstructs textual prompts into design elements and describes their geometry and spatial relations. The second agent translates the description into code using the Rhino.Geometry coding library in the Rhino3D-Grasshopper modeling environment. A final agent reassembles the models and adds parametric control interfaces, enabling customizable outputs. In this paper, we describe the method’s architecture and the training methodologies, including in-context learning and fine-tuning. The results demonstrate that the suggested method successfully generates code for variations of familiar objects. However, it still struggles with more complex designs that deviate significantly from the training data. We outline future directions for improvement, including expanding the training dataset and exploring advanced LLM models.

10.1177/1548512919860222,Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation,"Simulating battle management is an essential technique used in planning and mission rehearsal as well as training. Simulation development costs tend to be high due to the complexity of cognitive system architectures in such applications. Due to this complexity, it takes significant effort for a simulation developer to comprehend the problem domain enough to capture accurately in a simulation code. Domain-specific languages (DSL) play an important role in narrowing the communication gap between the domain user and the developer and hence facilitate rapid development. In command and control (C2) applications, the coalition battle management language (C-BML) serves as a DSL for exchanging battle information among C2 systems, simulations, and autonomous elements. In this article, we use a rapid prototyping framework for cognitive agents and demonstrate deployment of agent systems by adopting the model driven engineering approach. To this end, we extend the use of C-BML and automatically transform it in a cognitive agent model, which is then used for adaptive decision making at runtime. As a result, during a simulation run, it is possible to initialize and modify an agent’s goal reasoning model. The cognitive agent models are based on the deliberative coherence theory, which provides a goal reasoning system in terms of coherence-driven agents. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

However, conventional software architectures such as sense-model-plan-act and behaviour-based paradigms are inadequate for meeting the requirements. A lack of sensing during acting in the sense-model-plan-act paradigm makes the software slow to react to run-time contingencies, whereas the behaviour-based architectures typically fall short in planning of long-range steps and making optimized plan adaptations. This article proposes a hybrid software architecture that maintains both adaptivity and reactivity of robot behaviours in dynamic environments. To implement this architecture, we further present the multi-agent development framework known as AutoRobot, which views the robot software as a multi-agent system in which diverse agent roles collaborate to achieve software functionalities. To demonstrate the applicability and validity of our concrete framework and software architecture, we conduct an experiment to implement a typical case, for example, a robot that autonomously picks up and drops off dishes for remote guests, which requires the robot to plan and navigate in a highly dynamic environment and can adapt its behaviours to unexpected situations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

10.1186/2195-2701-1-2,"City, Territory and Architecture","Cities and territories share structural references to a common environmental ontology, in which space perception and representation play a major role. Many human abilities deal with space management, whose ontology can be useful in building intelligent machines in which space conceptualization plays a fundamental role. Space organizing is an important human ability, in which sensorial and mental abilities intriguingly interact. The analysis of human intelligent abilities in this functional perspective helps in shedding light on aspects otherwise erroneously given for granted. Human agents conceptualize, design and organize spaces for human organizations, for example in architectural design, by using numerous routine and non-routine cognitive processes often analysed. Yet automated reasoning/design agents still provide only bad copies of human performances. Here, creativity is postulated as a non-routine sophisticated human cognitive function, a conscious and intentional process for redefining agents’ situations in the world in new ways. Even if the concept of creativity remains controversial, an increasing number of cognitive scientists considers creativity as a specific part of the ordinary cognitive equipment of the human agent, to be used in certain situations, not confined to a limited set of exceptional human agents.In this context, we assume that it is worthwhile adding spatial domain to the other domains of creativity studied in cognitive science. We also assume that space understanding and space organizing can be fruitfully analyzed and modelled by paying attention to both routine and non-routine (creative) cognitive functions. The domain of civil architecture is a relevant domain of spatial knowledge and action and of course of spatial organization. In it, aesthetics and art, based on creativity mechanisms, play an important role. Studies on architectural creativity based on self-biographies by leading architects (who usually motivate their designs with memories of other designs or spaces, or architectures, experienced by them in the past) prove that spatial memory has primary importance on creativity. The paper carries out an introductory discussion on such issues, by analysing the case studies of single-agent and multi-agent spatial organizations under the level of spatial design. The paper explores possible modelling approaches and system architectures supporting cognition-oriented activities in spatial organizations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

This paper introduces a novel RL-driven monitoring framework, embedded in a modular, standards-compliant Web architecture, that autonomously detects and mitigates data integrity issues in real time. The proposed framework integrates a deep Q-learning agent with semantic metadata pipelines and RESTful microservices to dynamically adjust detection thresholds, refine anomaly classification policies, and incorporate human feedback into its learning loop. Unlike conventional rule-based systems, the RL agent continuously refines its decision policy through real-time interaction with dynamic data streams and operator feedback. Extensive experiments conducted on emulated smart grid datasets demonstrate the system's practical benefits: a 20% absolute increase in anomaly detection accuracy (from 75% to 95%), a 53% reduction in false positive rate (from 15% to 7%), and a stable average detection latency of 240 ms, all without human-in-the-loop reconfiguration. The RL agent also demonstrates stable convergence and linear scalability, making it well-suited for growing smart grid infrastructures. The system also incorporates a Web-native dashboard that visualizes time-aligned energy consumption and anomaly events while enabling real-time operator feedback, which further optimizes the learning trajectory. These results highlight the feasibility and effectiveness of embedding adaptive, self-optimizing learning agents directly into Web-based infrastructure to ensure long-term data integrity, transparency, and operational resilience. The proposed framework contributes to advancing intelligent Web engineering practices and lays the groundwork for scalable, autonomous monitoring solutions across a wide range of data-intensive infrastructure domains.",
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002198,PLOS Computational Biology,"Traditional approaches to cognitive modelling generally portray cognitive events in terms of 'discrete' states (point attractor dynamics) rather than in terms of processes, thereby neglecting the time structure of cognition. In contrast, more recent approaches explicitly address this temporal dimension, but typically provide no entry points into cognitive categorization of events and experiences. With the aim to incorporate both these aspects, we propose a framework for functional architectures. Our approach is grounded in the notion that arbitrary complex (human) behaviour is decomposable into functional modes (elementary units), which we conceptualize as low-dimensional dynamical objects (structured flows on manifolds). The ensemble of modes at an agent's disposal constitutes his/her functional repertoire. The modes may be subjected to additional dynamics (termed operational signals), in particular, instantaneous inputs, and a mechanism that sequentially selects a mode so that it temporarily dominates the functional dynamics. The inputs and selection mechanisms act on faster and slower time scales then that inherent to the modes, respectively. The dynamics across the three time scales are coupled via feedback, rendering the entire architecture autonomous. We illustrate the functional architecture in the context of serial behaviour, namely cursive handwriting. Subsequently, we investigate the possibility of recovering the contributions of functional modes and operational signals from the output, which appears to be possible only when examining the output phase flow (i.e., not from trajectories in phase space or time). © 2011 Perdikis et al. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009383,PLOS Computational Biology,"Insects can navigate efficiently in both novel and familiar environments, and this requires flexiblity in how they are guided by sensory cues. A prominent landmark, for example, can elicit strong innate behaviours (attraction or menotaxis) but can also be used, after learning, as a specific directional cue as part of a navigation memory. However, the mechanisms that allow both pathways to co-exist, interact or override each other are largely unknown. Here we propose a model for the behavioural integration of innate and learned guidance based on the neuroanatomy of the central complex (CX), adapted to control landmark guided behaviours. We consider a reward signal provided either by an innate attraction to landmarks or a long-term visual memory in the mushroom bodies (MB) that modulates the formation of a local vector memory in the CX. Using an operant strategy for a simulated agent exploring a simple world containing a single visual cue, we show how the generated shortterm memory can support both innate and learned steering behaviour. In addition, we show how this architecture is consistent with the observed effects of unilateral MB lesions in ants that cause a reversion to innate behaviour. We suggest the formation of a directional memory in the CX can be interpreted as transforming rewarding (positive or negative) sensory signals into a mapping of the environment that describes the geometrical attractiveness (or repulsion).

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011316,PLOS Computational Biology,"The ability to acquire abstract knowledge is a hallmark of human intelligence and is believed by many to be one of the core differences between humans and neural network models. Agents can be endowed with an inductive bias towards abstraction through meta-learning, where they are trained on a distribution of tasks that share some abstract structure that can be learned and applied. However, because neural networks are hard to interpret, it can be difficult to tell whether agents have learned the underlying abstraction, or alternatively statistical patterns that are characteristic of that abstraction. In this work, we compare the performance of humans and agents in a meta-reinforcement learning paradigm in which tasks are generated from abstract rules. We define a novel methodology for building “task metamers” that closely match the statistics of the abstract tasks but use a different underlying generative process, and evaluate performance on both abstract and metamer tasks. We find that humans perform better at abstract tasks than metamer tasks whereas common neural network architectures typically perform worse on the abstract tasks than the matched metamers. This work provides a foundation for characterizing differences between humans and machine learning that can be used in future work towards developing machines with more human-like behavior. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

The autonomous network-based information services integration architecture has been designed to satisfy the multiservice utilization in rapidly changing environments. However, the increase in the total number of user requests and changes lead to the unbalancing load in the system and the overload in the locality. This paper proposes a new strategy to solve such problem. Autonomous load distribution can be achieved through the integrated access method, which reduces the total load of the system for the number of Pull-MAs sent to the system decrease. In addition, the information structure of integrated service area is effective to improve the ratio of the satisfaction of Pull-MAs with joint request on one node. As a result, the homogeneous distribution of the separated services requests and correlated services requests is guaranteed autonomously. The simulation witnesses the success of the proposed mechanism. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

In the missile defence scenario, the concept of TMD is generally used for the optimal allocation of interceptors to counter the attack missiles. The problem is computationally complex due to the presence of enormous state space. The Learning vector quantiser-Radial basis function (LVQ-RBF) multi-agent hybrid neural architecture is used as the learning structure, and Q-learning as the learning method. The LVQ-RBF multi-agent hybrid neural architecture overcomes the complex state space issue using the partitioning and weighted learning approach. The proposed LVQ-RBF multi- agent hybrid architecture improvises the learning performance by the local and global error criterion. The state space is explored with initial coarse partitioning by LVQ neural network. The fine partitioning of the state space is performed using the multi-agent RBF neural network. The discrete reward scheme is used for LVQ-RBF multi-agent hybrid neural architecture. It has a hierarchical architecture which enables quicker convergence without the loss of accuracy.

Agent technology have been found to be suitable for modelling tactical behaviour of entities at multiple level of resolution under hierarchical command and control (C2) structure and provide a powerful abstraction mechanism required for designing simulations of complex and dynamic battlefield situations. Intelligent agents can potentially reduce the overhead on such experiments and studies. Command agents, plan how to carry out the operation and assign tasks to subordinate agents. They receive information from battlefield environment and use such information to build situation awareness and also to respond to unforeseen situations. In the paper, we have proposed a mechanism for modelling tactical behaviour of an intelligent agent by which higher command level entities should be able to synthesize their beliefs derived from the lower level sub ordinates entities. This paper presents a role-based belief, desire and intention mechanism to facilitate in the representation of military hierarchy, modelling of tactical behaviour based on agent current belief, teammate's belief propagation, and coordination issues.

The need for self-adaptive software systems has increased tremendously in last decade due to ever changing user requirements, improvement in technology and need for building software that reacts to user preferences. To build this type of software we need well establish models that have the flexibility to adjust to the new requirements and make sure that the adaptation is efficient and reliable. Feedback loop has proven to be very effective in modeling and developing SAS, these loops help the system to sense, analyze, plan, test and execute the adaptive behavior at runtime. Formal methods are well defined, rigorous and reliable mathematical techniques that can be effectively used to reason and specify behavior of SAS at design and run-time. Agents can play an important role in modeling SAS because they can work independently, with other agents and with environment as well. Using agents to perform individual steps in feedback loop and formalizing these agents using Petri nets will not only increase the reliability, but also, the adaptation can be performed efficiently for taking decisions at run time with increased confidence.

This leads to the diversity of the similar services and their developed nature, which makes the discovery of a relevant service during the composition phase a complex task. Since most of the competition companies aim to discover high-quality services with minimum charges in order to increase the number of customers and their profit. The semantic WSs allow performing dynamic service discovery through the entities software and intelligent agents. However, the solutions provided to the discovery process are limited to their performance in terms of the quickness to respond to the request in real-time, without considering the constraints such as the accuracy in the discovery phase and the quality of the similarity mechanism evaluation. They usually are based on the similarity measure of distance between concepts in the ontology instead of taking into consideration the relationships semantically and the strength of the semantic relationship between concepts in the context. In this paper, we proposed a novel hybrid semantic similarity method to improve the service discovery process. The hybrid method is applied to an architecture based on mobile agents, where cooperative agents are integrated to facilitate and speed up the discovery process. In the first hybrid method, we defined the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) with a semantic relatedness measure to avoid the ambiguity of the terms and obtain a purely semantic relatedness at level of the service description. The second one is defined to analyze the relationships at the level of the I/O service based on the subsumption reasoning, called IOMATCHING. Experimental results on a real data set demonstrate that our solution outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, and consumed time of the service discovery. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

In assisting customers, companies employ virtual service agents (chatbots) to provide support via communication devices. The primary focus is to automate the generation of conversational chat between a computer and a human by constructing virtual service agents that can predict appropriate and automatic responses to customers’ queries. This paper aims to present and implement a seq2seq-based learning task model based on encoder-decoder architectural solutions by training generative chatbots on customer support Twitter datasets. The model is based on deep Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) structures which are uni-directional and bi-directional encoder types of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). The RNNs are augmented with an attention layer to focus on important information between input and output sequences. Word level embedding such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText are employed as input to the model. Incorporating the base architecture, a comparative analysis is applied where baseline models are compared with and without the use of attention as well as different types of input embedding for each experiment.

This results in substantial financial losses, with billions of dollars being lost each year. Given the expected surge in the volume of online transactions in the upcoming years, there is a critical need for improved fraud detection strategies. To tackle this problem, the article proposes a deep reinforcement learning approach for the automatic detection of fraudulent e-commerce transactions. The architecture's policy is built on the implementation of artificial neural networks (ANNs). The classification problem is viewed as a step-by-step decision-making procedure. The implementation of the model involves the use of the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to acquire initial weight values. After that, in each step, the agent obtains a sample and performs a classification, with the environment providing a reward for each classification action. To encourage the model to concentrate on detecting fraudulent transactions precisely, the reward for identifying the minority class is higher than that for the majority class. With the aid of a supportive learning setting and a specific reward system, the agent ultimately determines the best approach to achieve its objectives. The performance of the suggested model is assessed utilizing a publicly available dataset contributed by the Machine Learning group at the Université Libre de Bruxelles. The experimental outcomes, determined using recognized evaluation measures, indicate that the model has attained a high level of accuracy. As a result, the suggested model is considered appropriate for identifying deceitful transactions in e-commerce. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

An expert system is a symbolic AI that can explain the reasoning it reached to, which typically is a rule-based system has been attractive for different domains such as medicine, agriculture, and operations. On average, these systems involve hundreds of rules that are instable; moreover, they are coded at low levels of abstraction. Therefore, designing and reengineering an expert system is still costly and needs technical knowledge because of the manual process and maintaining of a low-level abstraction. On the other hand, model-driven architecture (MDA) has proven to be a successful technology that raised the abstraction level and formalized it to automate software development. It specifies business aspects in the platformindependent model (PIM) and implementation aspects in a platform-specific model (PSM). It then automates mapping between them using a standard mapping language called QueryView- Transform QVT. This paper argues that utilizing MDA principles such as the automation and abstractions represented by the descriptor PIM and PSM and mappings metamodels will not only overcome the instability of rules of expert systems, but also provides new insights for its usage. Therefore, this work proposes an MDA-compliant methodology that adopts a UML sequence diagram, a class diagram for the PIM descriptor, and a generic PSM) based on production rules. Moreover, a UML profile to support lacking features in the sequence model has been developed. However, the paper argues for a new kind of process-oriented expert system.

Considering the complex coupling between charging stations and the power system in a smart grid environment, this paper proposes a distributed scheduling strategy based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) to achieve efficient, coordinated management of charging infrastructure and power resources. The proposed approach constructs a hierarchical decision-making architecture to jointly optimize intra-regional resource allocation and cross-regional power support, modeling the scheduling process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and treating regional charging stations, power nodes, and material units as independent agents. Through the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning mechanism, each agent autonomously learns optimal scheduling policies in the presence of uncertain demand and supply fluctuations, thus enabling rapid response and enhancing system robustness.

To assist other agents in the system, an agent performing recognition observes the tasks other agents are performing. Unlike the much-studied field of plan recognition, the overall intent of an agent is recognized instead of a specific plan. The observing agent may use capabilities that it has not observed. In this study, the key research question is: What are intent-recognition systems and how can these be used to have agents autonomously assist each other effectively and efficiently? A conceptual framework is proposed to address this question. An implementation of the conceptual framework is tested and evaluated. A set of metrics, including task time and number of communications, is used to compare the performance of plan recognition and intent recognition.

One of the most problematic issues in increasing the efficiency of their functioning is ensuring the adaptability function in EW means, as well as timely detection of threats and formation of appropriate countermeasures. This problem is solved by implementing a multi-agent architecture, the task of which is to ensure continuous exchange of information, both between agents in the EW means themselves and in the system as a whole. The considered method of increasing the adaptability of the system due to LLM with self-learning mechanisms provides the system with the opportunity to improve its data processing algorithms, promptly detect new types of signals and respond to changes in the parameters of the enemy’s REM. Using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach allows to detect and enter new types of signals into the database and quickly form appropriate recommendations for countermeasures. An equally important component is the use of combining several EW tools into a single information network. This approach will ensure the consistency of the actions of all EW tools (agents) and the rapid exchange of information between them. Taking into account the above, there is a possibility of significantly increasing the adaptability and efficiency of EW systems by integrating multi-agent structures using LLM, which allow optimizing resource allocation and making decisions in real time. This will ensure a high level of adaptation of EW tools, which is an important feature for working in conditions of dynamically changing electromagnetic environments.

The main attention is focused on their interaction and efficiency of functioning, their adaptive capabilities in a dynamically changing and complex electromagnetic environment. One of the key problems is ensuring reliable, stable and flexible coordination of swarm actions in conditions of electromagnetic influence of enemy radioelectronic means (REM). Coordination of swarm actions and measures should include continuous monitoring of the spectrum, timely adaptation to enemy countermeasures. To solve this problem, it is proposed to create an adaptive swarm architecture that implements the principles of decentralized control using machine learning algorithms, a multi-agent approach and software-configuration architecture of radio systems (SDR). The developed approach is based on the application of cognitive strategies for interaction between UAVs and the formation of a dynamic network structure that is self-repairing in the event of damage or interference. The proposed conceptual approach allows for significantly increasing the effectiveness of influencing the enemy’s REM environment through dynamic spatial-temporal distribution of interference, taking into account the tactical situation and spectral characteristics of threats. It is envisaged to integrate strike and reconnaissance UAVs into a single swarm structure with autonomous coordination of actions, which expands the functionality of the swarm from the placement of multi-frequency interference to the detection, tracking and neutralization of critically important objects. This approach provides a high level of autonomy, adaptability and survivability of unmanned platforms in difficult conditions of electronic warfare, and also creates the prerequisites for significantly increasing the effectiveness of combat operations in a modern hightech environment by integrating reconnaissance and strike functions and EW means into a single information system. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1561/2600000007,Foundations and Trends in Systems and Control,"This tutorial investigates the problem of the occurrence of multiple faults in the sensors used to monitor and control a network of cyberphysical systems. The goal is to formulate a general methodology, which will be used for designing sensor fault diagnosis schemes with emphasis on the isolation of multiple sensor faults, and for analyzing the performance of these schemes with respect to the design parameters and system characteristics. The backbone of the proposed methodology is the design of several monitoring and aggregation cyber agents (modules) with specific properties and tasks. The monitoring agents check the healthy operation of sets of sensors and infer the occurrence of faults in these sensor sets based on structured robustness and sensitivity properties. These properties are obtained by deriving analytical redundancy relations of observer-based residuals sensitive to specific subsets of sensor faults, and adaptive thresholds that bound the residuals under healthy conditions, assuming bounded modeling uncertainty and measurement noise. The aggregation agents are employed to collect and process the decisions of the agents, while they apply diagnostic reasoning to isolate combinations of sensor faults that have possibly occurred. The design and performance analysis methodology is presented in the context of three different architectures: for cyber-physical systems that consist of a set of interconnected systems, a distributed architecture and a decentralized architecture, and for cyber-physical systems that are treated as monolithic, a centralized architecture. For all three architectures, the decomposition of the sensor set into subsets of sensors plays a key role in their ability to isolate multiple sensor faults. A discussion of the challenges and benefits of the three architectures is provided, based on the system scale, the type of system nonlinearities, the number of sensors and the communication needs.

Despite a large number of reinforcement learning (RL) methods focusing on safety-critical tasks, there is still a lack of high-quality evaluation of those algorithms that adheres to safety constraints at each decision step under complex and unknown dynamics. In this paper, we revisit prior work in this scope from the perspective of state-wise safe RL and categorize them as projection-based, recovery-based, and optimization-based approaches, respectively. Furthermore, we propose Unrolling Safety Layer (USL), a joint method that combines safety optimization and safety projection. This novel technique explicitly enforces hard constraints via the deep unrolling architecture and enjoys structural advantages in navigating the trade-off between reward improvement and constraint satisfaction. To facilitate further research in this area, we reproduce related algorithms in a unified pipeline and incorporate them into SafeRL-Kit, a toolkit that provides off-the-shelf interfaces and evaluation utilities for safety-critical tasks. We then perform a comparative study of the involved algorithms on six benchmarks ranging from robotic control to autonomous driving. The empirical results provide an insight into their applicability and robustness in learning zero-cost-return policies without task-dependent handcrafting.

In this work, to further pursue these advances, we introduce a new data generator for machine reasoning that integrates with an embodied agent. The generated data consists of templated text queries and answers, matched with world-states encoded into a database. The world-states are a result of both world dynamics and the actions of the agent. We show the results of several baseline models on instantiations of train sets. These include pre-trained language models fine-tuned on a text-formatted representation of the database, and graph-structured Transformers operating on a knowledge-graph representation of the database. We find that these models can answer some questions about the world-state, but struggle with others.

Preference-based RL (PbRL) offers a promising approach by using human preferences to train agents, eliminating the need for manual reward design. While successful in single-agent tasks, extending PbRL to complex multi-agent scenarios is nontrivial. Existing PbRL methods lack the capacity to comprehensively capture both temporal and cooperative aspects, leading to inadequate reward functions. This work introduces an advanced multi-agent preference learning framework that effectively addresses these limitations. Based on a cascaded Transformer architecture, our approach captures both temporal and cooperative dependencies, alleviating issues related to reward uniformity and intricate interactions among agents.

RL is also very brittle; agents often overfit to their training environment and fail to generalize to new settings. Unsupervised environment design (UED) has been proposed as a solution to this problem, in which the agent trains in environments that have been specially selected to help it learn. Previous UED algorithms focus on trying to train an RL agent that generalizes across a large distribution of environments. This is not necessarily desirable when we wish to prioritize performance in one environment over others. In this work, we will be examining the setting of robust RL building control, where we wish to train an RL agent that prioritizes performing well in normal weather while still being robust to extreme weather conditions. We demonstrate a novel UED algorithm, ActivePLR, that uses uncertainty-aware neural network architectures to generate new training environments at the limit of the RL agent's ability while being able to prioritize performance in a desired base environment.

These classical heuristics act as dense reward generators to alleviate the sparse-rewards issue and enable our RL agent to learn domain-specific value functions as residuals on these heuristics, making learning easier. Correct application of this technique requires consolidating the discounted metric used in RL and the non-discounted metric used in heuristics. We implement the value functions using Neural Logic Machines, a neural network architecture designed for grounded first-order logic inputs.

10.1613/jair.1548,Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research,"Software agents can be used to automate many of the tedious, time-consuming information processing tasks that humans currently have to complete manually. However, to do so, agent plans must be capable of representing the myriad of actions and control flows required to perform those tasks. In addition, since these tasks can require integrating multiple sources of remote information - typically, a slow, I/O-bound process - it is desirable to make execution as efficient as possible. To address both of these needs, we present a flexible software agent plan language and a highly parallel execution system that enable the efficient execution of expressive agent plans. The plan language allows complex tasks to be more easily expressed by providing a variety of operators for flexibly processing the data as well as supporting subplans (for modularity) and recursion (for indeterminate looping). The executor is based on a streaming dataflow model of execution to maximize the amount of operator and data parallelism possible at runtime. We have implemented both the language and executor in a system called THESEUS. Our results from testing THESEUS show that streaming dataflow execution can yield significant speedups over both traditional serial (von Neumann) as well as non-streaming dataflow-style execution that existing software and robot agent execution systems currently support. In addition, we show how plans written in the language we present can represent certain types of subtasks that cannot be accomplished using the languages supported by network query engines.

This paper presents an agent architecture that enables software agents to learn by direct observation of the actions executed by expert agents while they are performing a task. This is possible because the proposed architecture displays information that is essential for observation, making it possible for software agents to observe each other. The agent architecture supports a learning process that covers all aspects of learning by observation, such as discovering and observing experts, learning from the observed data, applying the acquired knowledge and evaluating the agent's progress. The evaluation provides control over the decision to obtain new knowledge or apply the acquired knowledge to new problems. We combine two methods for learning from the observed information. The first one, the recall method, uses the sequence on which the actions were observed to solve new problems. The second one, the classification method, categorizes the information in the observed data and determines to which set of categories the new problems belong. Results show that agents are able to learn in conditions where common supervised learning algorithms fail, such as when agents do not know the results of their actions a priori or when not all the effects of the actions are visible.

Furthermore, existing approaches for dealing with uncertainty typically do not offer syntactical or tractable ways of reasoning about uncertainty. This complicates their integration with BDI implementations, which heavily rely on fast and reactive decisions. In this paper, we advance the state-of-the-art w.r.t. handling different types of uncertainty in BDI agents. The contributions of this paper are, first, a new way of modelling the beliefs of an agent as a set of epistemic states. Each epistemic state can use a distinct underlying uncertainty theory and revision strategy, and commensurability between epistemic states is achieved through a stratification approach. Second, we present a novel syntactic approach to revising beliefs given unreliable input. We prove that this syntactic approach agrees with the semantic definition, and we identify expressive fragments that are particularly useful for resource-bounded agents. Third, we introduce full operational semantics that extend Can, a popular semantics for BDI, to establish how reasoning about uncertainty can be tightly integrated into the BDI framework. Fourth, we provide comprehensive experimental results to highlight the usefulness and feasibility of our approach, and explain how the generic epistemic state can be instantiated into various representations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Well-known research results in the field of model-oriented design of products, processes, systems and enterprises do not fully provide semantic interoperability in the interaction of stakeholders in the innovation process. The aim of this work is to build a knowledge-based system architecture that implements semantic interoperability of network enterprise participants at various stages of the product lifecycle. The work is based on the use of a model-oriented approach to building a digital thread at all stages of the product lifecycle, an ontological approach to semantic modeling of a distributed knowledge base and a multiagent approach to organizing interaction between interested participants in the innovation process. The paper proposes a functional architecture of a knowledge-based system that includes modules for planning the innovation process, forming product value characteristics and functional requirements, construction and value chain design. A multi-level system of ontologies of the innovation process is also developed and its application in the work of functional modules that provide access to associated knowledge bases is described. The development of knowledge-based systems based on the results obtained will allow us to find the best design solutions for the configuration of products and corresponding value chains due to the possible iteration of the innovation process and increasing the semantic interoperability of network enterprise stakeholders. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.17323/2587-814X.2025.1.7.21,Business Informatics,"Recommendation systems are widely used in the commercial field. The algorithms and architectures of recommendation systems are similar in various fields of application and have proven their effectiveness. Recommendations are based on the user’s profile, the manner of his behavior on various IT (Information Technology) resources, as well as on similar users. At the same time, the use of recommendation systems in specialized areas is not widespread. Technology divisions are a promising new area of application for recommendation systems, and IT experts themselves will be the users. The purpose of this article is to consider a combination of a recommendation system, machine learning (ML) and LLM (Large Language Model) and to design these tools in a single system. Data volumes are currently measured in petabytes (1015 bytes) and exabytes (1018 bytes). In order to process even technical information (metadata/technodata) from the surrounding IT landscape, from the IT systems used by experts, AI (Artificial Intelligence) agents are needed. This article provides a literature review regarding the use of recommendation systems in combination with LLM applications, and suggests an application architecture model that generates human-readable news from technical event logs. The system is designed for a group of users who work with big data (ML engineers, data analysts, and data researchers). It is a combination of recommendation system technologies, LLM, and machine learning models.

10.17705/1CAIS.03829,Communications of the Association for Information Systems,"Enterprise systems typically include constructs such as ledgers and journals with debit and credit entries as central pillars of the systems’ architecture due in part to accountants and auditors who demand those constructs. At best, structuring systems with such constructs as base objects results in the storing the same data at multiple levels of aggregation, which creates inefficiencies in the database. At worst, basing systems on such constructs destroys details that are unnecessary for accounting but that may facilitate decision making by other enterprise functional areas. McCarthy (1982) proposed the resources-events-agents (REA) framework as an alternative structure for a shared data environment more than thirty years ago, and scholars have further developed it such that it is now a robust design theory. Despite this legacy, the broad IS community has not widely researched REA. In this paper, we discuss REA’s genesis and primary constructs, provide a history of REA research, discuss REA’s impact on practice, and speculate as to what the future may hold for REA-based enterprise systems. We invite IS researchers to consider integrating REA constructs with other theories and various emerging technologies to help advance the future of information systems and business research. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

To address these challenges, this paper present a novel next-generation dispatching automation framework that synergistically integrates large language models (LLMs), knowledge graphs (KGs), and AI agent technologies. The proposed system harnesses LLMs for advanced natural language processing and semantic reasoning, employs KGs to construct a structured, multidimensional knowledge representation of grid entities and their interdependencies, and deploys AI agents for autonomous decision-making and dynamic operational optimization. Collectively, these components establish a closed-loop intelligent architecture encompassing “perception-cognition-decision-execution”, enhancing system-wide situational awareness and adaptive control. This study proposed a unified integration methodology for LLMs, KGs, and AI agents in power system dispatching and modularized functional implementations for scalable deployment. Furthermore, it provided comprehensive multi-scenario analyses to verify operational efficacy. The proposed system offers a transformative technical pathway for advancing intelligent dispatching in next-generation power grids by resolving key bottlenecks in data interoperability, decision transparency, and dynamic adaptability.",

10.18280/mmep.120612,Mathematical Modelling of Engineering Problems,"Financial markets are highly dynamic, driven by complex interactions between sentiment, volatility, and structural asset dependencies. Traditional portfolio optimization methods often rely on static assumptions, rendering them ineffective under volatile or rapidly shifting conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a Modular Portfolio Learning System (MPLS) based on a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning architecture. MPLS dynamically adjusts asset allocations in response to multi-source market signals, guided by a central Decision Fusion Framework (DFF) trained via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The system integrates three analytical modules: (1) a Sentiment Analysis Module (SAM) leveraging FinBERT to extract market mood from financial news, (2) a Volatility Forecasting Module (VFM) combining LSTM and Bayesian modeling for risk estimation, (3) a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that captures inter-asset and sectoral relationships. A dedicated PPO agent in DFF learns to adaptively fuse these signals over time. The hierarchical architecture of MPLS features a High-Level Agent (HLA) for sector allocation and Low-Level Agents (LLAs) for intra-sector decisions, combining strategic foresight with tactical flexibility. Empirical results across S&P 500, DAX, and FTSE 100 under multiple regimes show that MPLS outperforms conventional baselines, achieving up to +38.2% improvement in Sharpe Ratio and −24.1% reduction in maximum drawdown compared to single-agent PPO and risk-parity models. MPLS thus provides a scalable and interpretable solution for adaptive portfolio optimization under uncertainty. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Then, we present the argumentation-based model of deliberation and decision by the park manager agent as a case study. We show how our argument-based approach allows to model various cognitive profiles of park managers (more conservationist or more sensitive to social issues), through different knowledge bases.

DeLC assists students and teachers in organizing learning materials, addressing knowledge gaps, conducting exams, and fostering personalized e-learning environments. The project scope encompasses various extensions, including an agent-oriented environment that enriches functionalities with reactive and proactive intelligent components, referred to as agents or assistants. This paper focuses on the latest evolution of the FraudDetector software agent, transitioning from its base functionality for fraud detection to leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. The goal is to integrate AI, specifically the knowledgebase provided by ChatGPT, to enhance FraudDetector’s effectiveness. This integration is the primary contribution of the research, aimed at improving fraud detection precision. Experimentation reveals promising results, suggesting that involving ChatGPT enriches FraudDetector’s functionality and enhances the agent’s precision.

Both choices run counter to expectations framed by scholars active in the domain of rich cognitive modelling that see agent reasoning as socially inherently contextualized. The Manchester school of social simulation proposed a particular kind of a socially contextualized reasoning mechanism, so called endorsements, to implement the cognitive processes underlying agent action selection that eventually causes agent interaction. Its usefulness lies in its lightweight architecture and in taking into account folk psychological conceptions of how reasoning works. These and other advantages make endorsements an amenable tool in everyday social simulation modelling. A yet outstanding comprehensive introduction to the concept of endorsements is provided and its theoretical basis is extended and extant research is critically reviewed.

10.18564/jasss.3855,JASSS,"As agent-based modelling gains popularity, the demand for transparency in underlying modelling assumptions grows. Behavioural rules guiding agents’ decisions, learning, interactions and possible changes in these should rely on solid theoretical and empirical grounds. This field has matured enough to reach the point at which we need to go beyond just reporting what social theory we base these rules upon. Many social science theories operate with various abstract constructions such as attitudes, perceptions, norms or intentions. These concepts are rather subjective and remain open to interpretation when operationalizing them in a formal model code. There is a growing concern that how modellers interpret qualitative social science theories in quantitative ABMs may differ from case to case. Yet, formal tests of these differences are scarce and a systematic approach to analyse any possible disagreements is lacking. Our paper addresses this gap by exploring the consequences of variations in formalizations of one social science theory on the simulation outcomes of agent-based models of the same class. We ran simulations to test the impact of four differences: in model architecture concerning specific equations and their sequence within one theory, in factors affecting agents’ decisions, in representation of these potentially differing factors, and finally in the underlying distribution of data used in a model. We illustrate emergent outcomes of these differences using an agent-based model developed to study regional impacts of households’ solar panel investment decisions. The Theory of Planned Behaviour was applied as one of the most common social science theories used to define behavioural rules of individual agents. Our findings demonstrate qualitative and quantitative differences in simulation outcomes, even when agents’ decision rules are based on the same theory and data.

The MBSSM architecture is based on a middle-range theory approach most recently expounded by analytical sociology and is designed in the object-oriented programming paradigm with Unified Modelling Language diagrams. This paper presents two worked examples of using the architecture for modelling individual behaviour mechanisms that give rise to the dynamics of population-level alcohol use: a single-theory model of norm theory and a multi-theory model that combines norm theory with role theory. The MBSSM architecture provides a computational environment within which theories based on social mechanisms can be represented, compared, and integrated.

10.18564/jasss.5214,JASSS,"To effectively manage complex human-environment fisheries systems, it is necessary to understand the psychology of fisher agents. While bio-economic models typically provide simple, abstract approaches for human behaviour (e.g., fully informed profit maximisers), fisher agents are of course neither simple nor perfect. Imperfections of learning, memory, and information availability, combined with the diversity of value preferences within populations, can lead to substantial deviations and unanticipated effects of interventions. This paper presents a computational model of fisher agents’ decision-making that draws on theoretical and empirical psychological insights to enrich this critical component. The model includes mechanisms for information integration (learning), social comparisons, and thresholds for economic satisfaction. In offering this enriched ac-count, the model captures how fishers may adapt behaviourally given changes in policy, economic conditions, or social pressures. Furthermore, the model can be parameterised to capture the effects of different socio-cultural contexts can be simulated. The model of fisher agents has been implemented as part of POSEIDON (an agent-based fisheries management model), showing that fishers imbued with the model learn and adapt when responding dynamically to changing conditions. The model is thus demonstrated in a fisheries environ-ment, but we discuss how its architecture could be implemented for simulation in other human-environment systems, such as designing policies to combat the human-environment problems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

In contrast to model-free approaches, which existing NeSAs take, learning an explicit world model has an interesting potential especially in the explainability, which is one of the key selling points of NeSA. To learn useful world models, we leverage one of the recent neuro-symbolic architectures, Logical Neural Networks (LNN). Here, we describe a method that can learn neuro-symbolic world models on the TextWorld-Commonsense set of games. We then show how this can be improved further by taking inspiration from the concept of proprioception, but for conversation. This is done by enhancing the internal logic state with a memory of previous actions while also guiding future actions by augmenting the learned model with constraints based on this memory. This greatly improves the game-solving agents performance in a TextWorld setting, where the advantage over the baseline is an 85% average steps reduction and ×2.3 average score. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Narratives are personal, as they are rooted in past experiences, and constitute perspectives on the world that might motivate different interpretations of the same observations. Concretely, the Candide model operationalises this idea by dynamically modelling the belief systems and background knowledge of individual agents, updating these as new linguistic observations come in, and exposing them to a logic reasoning engine that reveals the possible sources of divergent interpretations. Apart from introducing the foundational ideas, we also present a proof-of-concept implementation that demonstrates the approach through a number of illustrative examples. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

10.22260/ISARC2025/0032,Proceedings of the International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction,"Advancing the adaptivity of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), particularly empowering them to align with human expertise and learn from past experiences to infer optimal decisions in response to changing task demands and dynamic environment, is critical for their application in modular construction automation and reducing operational carbon footprints. Although a few learning paradigms based on human demonstrations have been introduced, robots remain rigid in structured tasks and lack internal adaptivity and authentic learning capabilities. This research explores a fundamental approach to equipping robots with an internal drive for self-reflection and conscious learning within a shared control setting, where human supervisors provide occasional corrective inputs and interventions. This approach is centered on the concept of interoception, which we factorize as”cognitive dissonance” within the robotic cognitive architecture. When significant decision divergence with human counterparts occurs, the robotic agent will actively seek decision rationale from semantic inputs, extracts knowledge from human scaffolding, encodes it into a memory system, and retrieves this”cached” knowledge for future decision-making in similar scenarios. This paper explores this new perspective to help build adaptive motion planning in AMRs. First, we propose integrating the legacy of heuristic costs from grid/graph-based path planning algorithms with a hypergraph model that caches declarative and procedural knowledge extracted from human semantic inputs. Second, we design a velocity-replay module that uses few-shot contrastive learning with a encoder-decoder architecture and compare its performance against reinforcement learning with human feedback and imitation learning. Two simulation demonstrations were conducted using the Issac Sim platform to showcase multi-robot synchronization and stacking collaboration. In addition, the proposed shared control paradigm was tested in a Gazebo environment in ROS, where human inputs were provided via relatively noisy brainwave-based control, compared to conventional peripheral devices. The results demonstrate how this approach better mitigates human input errors while facilitating autonomy for task completion compared to existing dominant shared control methods. The insights from this study resonate with recent advances in neuroscience and reinforcement learning, and pave the way toward artificial general intelligence in AMRs, fostering their progression from complexity to competence in construction automation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

10.24868/10715,Proceedings of the International Ship Control Systems Symposium,"Future military forces and platforms will need to operate within increasingly complex operational environments where the threats are more diverse and increasingly challenging. This will increase the volumes and speed of data and information that platforms and their commanders will need to capture, process and respond to. This inevitably leads to the consideration of greater levels of automation and the wider use of machine intelligence techniques across the Command and Control (C2) space. Research in this area to date has focused on the integration of intelligent machine agents, and automated systems, with human operators in specific or focused capability areas. To generate true operational advantage from the growing and diversifying data and information available to military commanders, it will be critical to build on these developments by addressing the design and operation of teams of multiple intelligent machine agents (e.g. as collaborative Artificial Intelligence (AI)) and to enable and optimise the integration of humans within those teams to form effective human-machine teams. The UK Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl - part of the UK MOD) has funded the Intelligent Ship project, which aimed to explore these future Human-Machine Machine-Machine Teaming (HM3T) architectures and relationships, and the approaches needed to enable them. The project’s vision is: Machine learning and AI will be more closely integrated and teamed with humans, leading to timely, more informed and trusted decision making and planning, within complex operating environments. This was undertaken through the combined developments of a range of component intelligent machine agents and through the development, evaluation and demonstration of those agents, with human operators, within a systems level architectural ‘sandpit’ known as the Intelligent Ship AI Network (ISAIN). This work was delivered by a multidisciplinary team of Dstl and 10+ suppliers and evaluated within Dstl’s Command Lab simulation environment facility. This paper will review the project’s aims, delivery approach, lessons learnt and challenges identified in its second phase, which completed in March 2022. This phase included a series of evaluation events, with each event growing in complexity and in the number of interacting agents and operators.

10.24868/10732,Proceedings of the International Ship Control Systems Symposium,"The Royal Netherlands Navy is moving towards more autonomous ships to cope with the increasingly complex naval operations while sailing with a reduced manning. The strong expansion of automation and autonomous systems on board requires new solutions for optimal collaboration between the crew and the extensive set of ship systems. We are developing a concept for an Integrated Multi-Manager Environment for Naval Ships: IMMENS. IMMENS aims to be an intelligent ship system that supports the crews of future ship classes, while enabling these crews to exercise and maintain meaningful human control. The ship’s subsystems are integrated in a multi-agent system that formulates and proposes plans to the command team based on an internal representation of the ship’s goals and the current situation. These plans consist of actions that are to be executed in order to achieve the mission goals. The system’s computational design, combined with specific human-machine teaming functionality facilitates the crew and IMMENS to work as a joint cognitive system. This paper shortly introduces IMMENS but reports mainly on the development and application of humanmachine teaming concepts that support cooperation between the crew and IMMENS. The first concept offers interaction based on a human-machine language using Goals, Tasks, Constraints and Resources as shared knowledge elements. Since both human and machine understand these elements, human comprehension of the machine's inner workings is supported. The second concept provides the explication of relationships between goals, tasks, constraints, resources and/or external world as a means of intuitively explaining the machine's reasoning by providing transparency regarding, for instance, to which goals certain tasks contribute. Thirdly, we applied and extended on the concept of play-based delegation. A play is a plan-template that allows a user to quickly delegate a complex task to the systems, without the need to drill down, while leaving room for system intelligence to fill in the details. These concepts have been applied in an integrated interactive demonstrator of IMMENS. An evaluation with subject matter experts from the Royal Netherlands Navy and senior human factors researchers was conducted based on a scenario of a frigate escorting a high-value asset. During the design, implementation and evaluation of the demonstrator, we learned that the first concept provided a workable shared knowledge model and indeed fitted with the IMMENS architecture on the one hand, and was intuitive to the users on the other hand. Explicating relationships provided the users with relevant insights, allowing them to understand, for instance, by means of which tasks and resources IMMENS expects to achieve the mission goals. Play-based delegation was found this a clear and valuable concept. Many opportunities for future research were identified, the most important of which concerns the feasibility of constructing a valid, complete and generic goal representation for IMMENS that takes into account the complexity of future missions and operational contexts, and includes the necessary world model. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

10.24963/ijcai.2018/66,IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,"Normative capabilities in multi-agent systems (MAS) can be represented within agents, separately as institutions, or a blend of the two. This paper addresses how to extend the principles of open MAS to the provision of normative reasoning capabilities, which are currently either embedded in existing MAS platforms - tightly coupled and inaccessible - or not present. We use a resource-oriented architecture (ROA) pattern, that we call deontic sensors, to make normative reasoning part of an open MAS architecture. The pattern specifies how to loosely couple MAS and normative frameworks, such that each is agnostic of the other, while augmenting the brute facts that an agent perceives with institutional facts, that capture each institution's interpretation of an agent's action. In consequence, a MAS without normative capabilities can acquire them, and an embedded normative framework can be de-coupled and opened to other MAS platforms. More importantly, the deontic sensor pattern allows normative reasoning to be published as services, opening routes to certification and re-use, creation of (formalized) trust and non-specialist access to “on demand” normative reasoning. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

The aim of the research described in this paper is to exploit the attractive features of MPC (meaningful objective functions and constraints) in a distributed implementation combining learning techniques to perform the negotiation of these variables in a cooperative Multi Agent environment and over a Multi Agent platform to provide speed, scalability, and computational effort reduction. This approach is based on negotiation, cooperation and learning.

In order to answer the modeler needs concerning complex agent design, we propose a new agent architecture based on the BDI paradigm and integrated into a simulation platform (GAMA).

Despite the long list of supervised methods for story completion and procedural understanding, current AI fails to generalize its procedural reasoning to unseen stories. This paper is based on the hypothesis that the generalization can be improved by associating downstream prediction with fine-grained modeling and the abstraction of procedural knowledge in stories. To test this hypothesis, we design LEAP: a comprehensive framework that reasons over stories by jointly considering their (1) overall plausibility, (2) conflict sentence pairs, and (3) participant physical states. LEAP integrates state-of-the-art modeling architectures, training regimes, and augmentation strategies based on natural and synthetic stories. To address the lack of densely annotated training data on participants and their physical states, we devise a robust automatic labeler based on semantic parsing and few-shot prompting with large language models. Our experiments with in- and out-of-domain tasks reveal insights into the interplay of architectures, training regimes, and augmentation strategies.

The agent has access to additional knowledge about the environment, which is represented in associative semantic memory. This memory is constructed based on ANAKG associative knowledge graphs, which have been shown to have several advantages over other semantic memories for processing symbolic sequential inputs. They are easy to organize and train. In this paper, we demonstrate that a motivated agent with semantic memory learns to achieve its goals more easily and utilizes environmental resources more effectively. To simplify comparisons with reinforcement learning, we represent the environment as an environmental graph that shows the principles governing it. By exploring the environment, the agent learns these principles and can use them to accomplish its tasks.

For an agent to efficiently benefit from having a functioning computational ToM of its human partner in a collaboration, it needs to be practical in computationally tracking their mental attitudes and it needs to create approximate ToM models that can be effectively maintained. In this paper, we propose a computational ToM mechanism based on abstracting beliefs and knowledge into higher-level human concepts, referred to as abstractions. These abstractions, similar to those guiding human interactions (e.g., trust), form the basis of our modular agent architecture.

This paper overcomes this limitation by introducing an operational semantics for BDI systems that rely on Classical Planning at run time to both cope with failures that were unforeseeable and synthesise new plans that were unspecified at design time.

A critical challenge is the agent’s ability to identify and monitor environmental elements pertinent to its objectives. Our research introduces a neurosymbolic modular architecture for reactive robotics. Our system combines a neural component performing object recognition over the environment and image processing techniques such as optical flow, with symbolic representation and reasoning. The reasoning system is grounded in the embodied cognition paradigm, via integrating image schematic knowledge in an ontological structure. The ontology is operatively used to create queries for the perception system, decide on actions, and infer entities’ capabilities derived from perceptual data. The combination of reasoning and image processing allows the agent to focus its perception for normal operation as well as discover new concepts for parts of objects involved in particular interactions. The discovered concepts allow the robot to autonomously acquire training data and adjust its subsymbolic perception to recognize the parts, as well as making planning for more complex tasks feasible by focusing search on those relevant object parts. We demonstrate our approach in a simulated world, in which an agent learns to recognize parts of objects involved in support relations. While the agent has no concept of handle initially, by observing examples of supported objects hanging from a hook it learns to recognize the parts involved in establishing support and becomes able to plan the establishment/destruction of the support relation. This underscores the agent’s capability to expand its knowledge through observation in a systematic way, and illustrates the potential of combining deep reasoning with reactive robotics in dynamic settings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

To do this successfully, they have to infer their intentions and choose actions that complement the predicted actions of their collaborators to perform the task efficiently. Since the peer’s state and action are generally not directly observable, these are usually estimated based on environmental change and then used to predict the intention. While humans can achieve this easily, this form of collaboration is difficult for artificial intelligent agents operating in partially observable environments, leading to agent architectures that do not attempt to explicitly infer other agents’ intentions but rather rely on additional knowledge or reactive collaboration, relying on the steady state character of other agents. In this paper, we propose an agent model that explicitly defines and utilizes estimates of other agents’ intentions to yield more effective collaboration in decentralized partially observable domains, where each agent’s knowledge of and current belief state in the environment can be different. The resulting agents explicitly estimate other agents’ intentions from their observations and utilize these estimates in a Reinforcement Learning process on a modified Dec-POMDP model to learn collaborative strategies.

In particular, our framework incorporates quantum computational routines (Deutsch–Jozsa, Bernstein–Vazirani, and Grover’s search) to enhance decision-making efficiency. As a novelty of this research, this comprehensive computational structure is empowered by quantum computing operations so that superiority in speed and robustness of learning compared to classical methods can be demonstrated. Another main contribution is that the proposed architecture offers some features, such as meta-cognition and situation awareness. The meta-cognition aspect is responsible for hierarchically learning sub-tasks, enabling the agent to achieve the master goal. The situation-awareness property identifies how spatial-temporal reasoning activities related to the world model of the agent can be extracted in a dynamic simulation environment with unstructured uncertainties by quantum computation-based machine learning algorithms with the explainable artificial intelligence paradigm. In this research, the Minecraft game-based simulation environment is utilized for the experimental evaluation of performance and verification tests within complex, multi-objective tasks related to the autonomous behaviors of a smart agent. By implementing several interaction scenarios, the results of the system performance and comparative superiority over alternative solutions are presented, and it is discussed how these autonomous behaviors and cognitive skills of a smart agent can be improved in further studies. Results show that the quantum-enhanced agent achieves 2× faster convergence to an 80% task success rate in exploration tasks and approximately 15% higher cumulative rewards compared to a classical deep RL baseline. These findings demonstrate the potential of quantum algorithms to significantly improve learning and performance in cognitive agent architectures.

We propose a system architecture that is based on three components: (1) AI-controlled chatbots that adapt to the player's behavior, (2) a multi-agent blackboard system as the backbone in order to keep components independent and optimize performance due to parallel processing, and (3) intelligent support for an automated evaluation of the player's performance and feedback generation. The training scenarios presented and discussed in this article include workplace-oriented conflict management, patient-centered medical interviews, and customer complaint management. First evaluation studies indicate that the scenarios may be well-suited for real training situations.

The agent can use these skills to learn a truthful knowledge model of the environment and thus predict the consequences of its own actions. For this purpose, the symbolic information received during the interaction and communication must be converted into representational data structures so that they can be stored in the knowledge model, processed logically and retrieved from there. Here, we firstly outline a grammar-based transformation mechanism that unifies the description of physical interaction and linguistic communication and on which the language acquisition is based. Specifically, we use minimalist grammar (MG) for this aim, which is a recent computational implementation of generative linguistics. In order to develop proper cognitive information and communication technologies, we are using utterance meaning transducers (UMT) that are based on semantic parsers and a mental lexicon, comprising syntactic and semantic features of the language under consideration. This lexicon must be acquired by a cognitive agent during interaction with its users. To this aim we outline a reinforcement learning algorithm for the acquisition of syntax and semantics of English utterances. English declarative sentences are presented to the agent by a teacher in form of utterance meaning pairs (UMP) where the meanings are encoded as formulas of predicate logic. Since MG codifies universal linguistic competence through inference rules, thereby separating innate linguistic knowledge from the contingently acquired lexicon, our approach unifies generative grammar and reinforcement learning, hence potentially resolving the still pending Chomsky-Skinner controversy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3389/fcomp.2022.846440,Frontiers in Computer Science,"This article introduces a three-axis framework indicating how AI can be informed by biological examples of social learning mechanisms. We argue that the complex human cognitive architecture owes a large portion of its expressive power to its ability to engage in social and cultural learning. However, the field of AI has mostly embraced a solipsistic perspective on intelligence. We thus argue that social interactions not only are largely unexplored in this field but also are an essential element of advanced cognitive ability, and therefore constitute metaphorically the “dark matter” of AI. In the first section, we discuss how social learning plays a key role in the development of intelligence. We do so by discussing social and cultural learning theories and empirical findings from social neuroscience. Then, we discuss three lines of research that fall under the umbrella of Social NeuroAI and can contribute to developing socially intelligent embodied agents in complex environments. First, neuroscientific theories of cognitive architecture, such as the global workspace theory and the attention schema theory, can enhance biological plausibility and help us understand how we could bridge individual and social theories of intelligence. Second, intelligence occurs in time as opposed to over time, and this is naturally incorporated by dynamical systems. Third, embodiment has been demonstrated to provide more sophisticated array of communicative signals. To conclude, we discuss the example of active inference, which offers powerful insights for developing agents that possess biological realism, can self-organize in time, and are socially embodied. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Along this stream, we propose a model that allows the simulated iCub robot to learn the meanings of actions (point, touch, and push) oriented toward objects in robot's peripersonal space. In our experiments, the iCub learns to execute motor actions and comment on them. Architecturally, the model is composed of three neural-network-based modules that are trained in different ways.The first module, a two-layer perceptron, is trained by back-propagation to attend to the target position in the visual scene, given the low-level visual information and the feature-based target information.The second module, having the form of an actor-critic architecture, is the most distinguishing part of our model, and is trained by a continuous version of reinforcement learning to execute actions as sequences, based on a linguistic command. The third module, an echo-state network, is trained to provide the linguistic description of the executed actions. The trained model generalizes well in case of novel action-target combinations with randomized initial arm positions. It can also promptly adapt its behavior if the action/target suddenly changes during motor execution. © 2012 Farkaš, Malík and Rebrová. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

It also allows machines and software agents to automatically determine the ideal behavior from a simple reward feedback (e.g., encouragement) to maximize their performance. Advancements in affective computing, especially emotional speech processing (ESP) have allowed for more natural interaction between humans and robots. Our research focuses on integrating a novel ESP system in a relevant virtual neurorobotic (VNR) application. We created an emotional speech classifier that successfully distinguished happy and utterances. The accuracy of the system was 95.3 and 98.7% during the offline mode (using an emotional speech database) and the live mode (using live recordings), respectively. It was then integrated in a neurorobotic scenario, where a virtual neurorobot had to learn a simple exercise through reward-based learning. If the correct decision was made the robot received a spoken reward, which in turn stimulated synapses (in our simulated model) undergoing spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and reinforced the corresponding neural pathways. Both our ESP and neurorobotic systems allowed our neurorobot to successfully and consistently learn the exercise.

In this respect, Intrinsic Motivations (i.e., motivations not connected to reward-related stimuli) play a cardinal role in animal learning, and can be considered as a fundamental tool for developing more autonomous and more adaptive artificial agents. In this work, we provide an exhaustive analysis of a scarcely investigated problem: which kind of IM reinforcement signal is the most suitable for driving the acquisition of multiple skills in the shortest time? To this purpose we implemented an artificial agent with a hierarchical architecture that allows to learn and cache different skills. We tested the system in a setup with continuous states and actions, in particular, with a kinematic robotic arm that has to learn different reaching tasks. We compare the results of different versions of the system driven by several different intrinsic motivation signals.

In biological agents, OC results in behavioral changes learned from the consequences of previous actions, based on progressive prediction adjustment from rewarding or punishing signals. In a neurorobotics context, virtual and physical autonomous robots may benefit from a similar learning skill when facing unknown and unsupervised environments. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple invariant micro-circuit can sustain OC in multiple learning scenarios. The motivation for this new OC implementation model stems from the relatively complex alternatives that have been described in the computational literature and recent advances in neurobiology. Our elementary kernel includes only a few crucial neurons, synaptic links and originally from the integration of habituation and spike-timing dependent plasticity as learning rules. Using several tasks of incremental complexity, our results show that a minimal neural component set is sufficient to realize many OC procedures.

The necessary technology has almost reached the required level, including sensors and actuators, but the cognitive organization is still in its infancy and is only partially supported by the current understanding of brain cognitive processes. The brain of symbiotic robots will certainly not be a “positronic” replica of the human brain: probably, the greatest part of it will be a set of interacting computational processes running in the cloud. In this article, we review the challenges that must be met in the design of a set of interacting computational processes as building blocks of a cognitive architecture that may give symbiotic capabilities to collaborative robots of the next decades: (1) an animated body-schema; (2) an imitation machinery; (3) a motor intentions machinery; (4) a set of physical interaction mechanisms; and (5) a shared memory system for incremental symbiotic development. We would like to stress that our approach is totally un-hierarchical: the five building blocks of the shared cognitive architecture are fully bi-directionally connected. For example, imitation and intentional processes require the “services” of the animated body schema which, on the other hand, can run its simulations if appropriately prompted by imitation and/or intention, with or without physical interaction. Successful experiences can leave a trace in the shared memory system and chunks of memory fragment may compete to participate to novel cooperative actions. And so on and so forth. At the heart of the system is lifelong training and learning but, different from the conventional learning paradigms in neural networks, where learning is somehow passively imposed by an external agent, in symbiotic robots there is an element of free choice of what is worth learning, driven by the interaction between the robot and the human partner. The proposed set of building blocks is certainly a rough approximation of what is needed by symbiotic robots but we believe it is a useful starting point for building a computational framework. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3389/fnbot.2018.00078,Frontiers in Neurorobotics,"Artificial autonomous agents and robots interacting in complex environments are required to continually acquire and fine-tune knowledge over sustained periods of time. The ability to learn from continuous streams of information is referred to as lifelong learning and represents a long-standing challenge for neural network models due to catastrophic forgetting in which novel sensory experience interferes with existing representations and leads to abrupt decreases in the performance on previously acquired knowledge. Computational models of lifelong learning typically alleviate catastrophic forgetting in experimental scenarios with given datasets of static images and limited complexity, thereby differing significantly from the conditions artificial agents are exposed to. In more natural settings, sequential information may become progressively available over time and access to previous experience may be restricted. Therefore, specialized neural network mechanisms are required that adapt to novel sequential experience while preventing disruptive interference with existing representations. In this paper, we propose a dual-memory self-organizing architecture for lifelong learning scenarios. The architecture comprises two growing recurrent networks with the complementary tasks of learning object instances (episodic memory) and categories (semantic memory). Both growing networks can expand in response to novel sensory experience: the episodic memory learns fine-grained spatiotemporal representations of object instances in an unsupervised fashion while the semantic memory uses task-relevant signals to regulate structural plasticity levels and develop more compact representations from episodic experience. For the consolidation of knowledge in the absence of external sensory input, the episodic memory periodically replays trajectories of neural reactivations. We evaluate the proposed model on the CORe50 benchmark dataset for continuous object recognition, showing that we significantly outperform current methods of lifelong learning in three different incremental learning scenarios. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

In this paper, we are considering the learning of a set of interrelated complex tasks hierarchically organized. To learn this high-dimensional mapping between a continuous high-dimensional space of tasks and an infinite dimensional space of unbounded sequences of actions, we introduce a new framework called “procedures”, which enables the autonomous discovery of how to combine previously learned skills in order to learn increasingly complex combinations of motor policies. We propose an active learning algorithmic architecture, capable of organizing its learning process in order to achieve a field of complex tasks by learning sequences of primitive motor policies. Based on heuristics of active imitation learning, goal-babbling and strategic learning using intrinsic motivation, our algorithmic architecture leverages our procedures framework to actively decide during its learning process which outcome to focus on and which exploration strategy to apply. We show on a simulated environment that our new architecture is capable of tackling the learning of complex motor policies by adapting the complexity of its policies to the task at hand. We also show that our “procedures” enable the learning agent to discover the task hierarchy and exploit his experience of previously learned skills to learn new complex tasks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3389/fnbot.2019.00045,Frontiers in Neurorobotics,"We propose an architecture for the open-ended learning and control of embodied agents. The architecture learns action affordances and forward models based on intrinsic motivations and can later use the acquired knowledge to solve extrinsic tasks by decomposing them into sub-tasks, each solved with one-step planning. An affordance is here operationalized as the agent's estimate of the probability of success of an action performed on a given object. The focus of the work is on the overall architecture while single sensorimotor components are simplified. A key element of the architecture is the use of “active vision” that plays two functions, namely to focus on single objects and to factorize visual information into the object appearance and object position. These processes serve both the acquisition and use of object-related affordances, and the decomposition of extrinsic goals (tasks) into multiple sub-goals (sub-tasks). The architecture gives novel contributions on three problems: (a) the learning of affordances based on intrinsic motivations; (b) the use of active vision to decompose complex extrinsic tasks; (c) the possible role of affordances within planning systems endowed with models of the world. The architecture is tested in a simulated stylized 2D scenario in which objects need to be moved or “manipulated” in order to accomplish new desired overall configurations of the objects (extrinsic goals). The results show the utility of using intrinsic motivations to support affordance learning; the utility of active vision to solve composite tasks; and the possible utility of affordances for solving utility-based planning problems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3389/fnbot.2019.00052,Frontiers in Neurorobotics,"It is well-established that human decision making and instrumental control uses multiple systems, some which use habitual action selection and some which require deliberate planning. Deliberate planning systems use predictions of action-outcomes using an internal model of the agent's environment, while habitual action selection systems learn to automate by repeating previously rewarded actions. Habitual control is computationally efficient but are not very flexible in changing environments. Conversely, deliberate planning may be computationally expensive, but flexible in dynamic environments. This paper proposes a general architecture comprising both control paradigms by introducing an arbitrator that controls which subsystem is used at any time. This system is implemented for a target-reaching task with a simulated two-joint robotic arm that comprises a supervised internal model and deep reinforcement learning. Through permutation of target-reaching conditions, we demonstrate that the proposed is capable of rapidly learning kinematics of the system without a priori knowledge, and is robust to (A) changing environmental reward and kinematics, and (B) occluded vision. The arbitrator model is compared to exclusive deliberate planning with the internal model and exclusive habitual control instances of the model. The results show how such a model can harness the benefits of both systems, using fast decisions in reliable circumstances while optimizing performance in changing environments. In addition, the proposed model learns very fast. Finally, the system which includes internal models is able to reach the target under the visual occlusion, while the pure habitual system is unable to operate sufficiently under such conditions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

With this purpose, we embedded a cerebellum-based control system into a humanoid robot that becomes capable of handling dynamical external and internal complexity. The cerebellum is the area of the brain that coordinates and predicts the body movements throughout the body-environment interactions. Different biologically plausible cerebellar models are available in literature and have been employed for motor learning and control of simplified objects. We built the canonical cerebellar microcircuit by combining machine learning and computational neuroscience techniques. The control system is composed of the adaptive cerebellar module and a classic control method; their combination allows a fast adaptive learning and robust control of the robotic movements when external disturbances appear. The control structure is built offline, but the dynamic parameters are learned during an online-phase training. The aforementioned adaptive control system has been tested in the Neuro-robotics Platform with the virtual humanoid robot iCub. In the experiment, the robot iCub has to balance with the hand a table with a ball running on it. In contrast with previous attempts of solving this task, the proposed neural controller resulted able to quickly adapt when the internal and external conditions change.

It is generally accepted that the motion control of quadruped animals is performed by neural circuits located in the spinal cord that act as a Central Pattern Generator and can generate appropriate locomotion patterns. This is thought to be the result of evolutionary processes that have optimized this network. On top of this, fine motor control is learned during the lifetime of the animal thanks to the plastic connections of the cerebellum that provide descending corrective inputs. This research aims at understanding and identifying the possible advantages of using learning during an evolution-inspired optimization for finding the best locomotion patterns in a robotic locomotion task. Accordingly, we propose a comparative study between two bio-inspired control architectures for quadruped legged robots where learning takes place either during the evolutionary search or only after that. The evolutionary process is carried out in a simulated environment, on a quadruped legged robot. To verify the possibility of overcoming the reality gap, the performance of both systems has been analyzed by changing the robot dynamics and its interaction with the external environment. Results show better performance metrics for the robotic agent whose locomotion method has been discovered by applying the adaptive module during the evolutionary exploration for the locomotion trajectories.

However, the results of these studies may not necessarily be accessible or intelligible to roboticians. In this paper, we review the main experimental data demonstrating the role of sensitivity to sensorimotor contingencies in infants' acquisition of four fundamental motor and cognitive abilities: body knowledge, memory, generalization, and goal-directedness. We relate this data from developmental psychology to work in robotics, highlighting the links between these two domains of research.

This research presents the first robotic instantiation of a complex architecture based on the Baddeley's Working Memory (WM) model. Our proposed method grants a scalable knowledge representation of verbal and non-verbal signals in the cognitive architecture, which supports incremental open-ended learning. Human spoken utterances about the workspace and the task are combined with the internal knowledge map of the robot to achieve task accomplishment goals. We train the robot to understand instructions involving higher-order (abstract) linguistic concepts of developmental complexity, which cannot be directly hooked in the physical world and are not pre-defined in the robot's static self-representation. Our proposed interactive learning method grants flexible run-time acquisition of novel linguistic forms and real-world information, without training the cognitive model anew. Hence, the robot can adapt to new workspaces that include novel objects and task outcomes. We assess the potential of the proposed methodology in verification experiments with a humanoid robot.

In addition to learning the concepts, it needs to learn relations between the concepts, in particular spatial relations between objects. In this paper, we propose three approaches that allow a cognitive agent to learn spatial relations. First, using an embodied model, the agent learns to reach toward an object based on simple instructions involving left-right relations. Since the level of realism and its complexity does not permit large-scale and diverse experiences in this approach, we devise as a second approach a simple visual dataset for geometric feature learning and show that recent reasoning models can learn directional relations in different frames of reference. Yet, embodied and simple simulation approaches together still do not provide sufficient experiences. To close this gap, we thirdly propose utilizing knowledge bases for disembodied spatial relation reasoning.

In these settings, error signals from multiple contexts can interfere with one another, ultimately leading to a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. In this article we investigate biologically inspired architectures as solutions to these problems. Specifically, we show that the biophysical properties of dendrites and local inhibitory systems enable networks to dynamically restrict and route information in a context-specific manner. Our key contributions are as follows: first, we propose a novel artificial neural network architecture that incorporates active dendrites and sparse representations into the standard deep learning framework. Next, we study the performance of this architecture on two separate benchmarks requiring task-based adaptation: Meta-World, a multi-task reinforcement learning environment where a robotic agent must learn to solve a variety of manipulation tasks simultaneously; and a continual learning benchmark in which the model's prediction task changes throughout training. Analysis on both benchmarks demonstrates the emergence of overlapping but distinct and sparse subnetworks, allowing the system to fluidly learn multiple tasks with minimal forgetting.

We argue that such a renouncement opens interesting ways to explore the possibilities for designing artificial agents with intrinsic motivations and constitutive autonomy. We then propose Artificial Interactionism, our approach that escapes the isolated perception paradigm by drawing on the inversion of the interaction cycle. When the interaction cycle is inverted, input data are not percepts directly received from the environment, but outcomes of control loops.

In contrast, data-driven approaches map the user input to the agent output directly, hence, provide more flexibility with these variations without requiring any set of rules. However, data-driven approaches are generally applied to single dialogue exchanges with a user and do not build up a memory over long-term conversation with different users, whereas long-term interactions require remembering users and their preferences incrementally and continuously and recalling previous interactions with users to adapt and personalise the interactions, known as the lifelong learning problem. In addition, it is desirable to learn user preferences from a few samples of interactions (i.e., few-shot learning). These are known to be challenging problems in machine learning, while they are trivial for rule-based approaches, creating a trade-off between flexibility and robustness. Correspondingly, in this work, we present the text-based Barista Datasets generated to evaluate the potential of data-driven approaches in generic and personalised long-term human-robot interactions with simulated real-world problems, such as recognition errors, incorrect recalls and changes to the user preferences.

The experiments show that while data-driven approaches are suitable for generic task-oriented dialogue and real-time interactions, no model performs sufficiently well to be deployed in personalised long-term interactions in the real world, because of their inability to learn and use new identities, and their poor performance in recalling user-related data. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3389/frobt.2024.1394209,Frontiers in Robotics and AI,"This work considers the problem of learning cooperative policies in multi-agent settings with partially observable and non-stationary environments without a communication channel. We focus on improving information sharing between agents and propose a new multi-agent actor-critic method called Multi-Agent Cooperative Recurrent Proximal Policy Optimization (MACRPO). We propose two novel ways of integrating information across agents and time in MACRPO: First, we use a recurrent layer in the critic’s network architecture and propose a new framework to use the proposed meta-trajectory to train the recurrent layer. This allows the network to learn the cooperation and dynamics of interactions between agents, and also handle partial observability. Second, we propose a new advantage function that incorporates other agents’ rewards and value functions by controlling the level of cooperation between agents using a parameter. The use of this control parameter is suitable for environments in which the agents are unable to fully cooperate with each other. We evaluate our algorithm on three challenging multi-agent environments with continuous and discrete action spaces, Deepdrive-Zero, Multi-Walker, and Particle environment. We compare the results with several ablations and state-of-the-art multi-agent algorithms such as MAGIC, IC3Net, CommNet, GA-Comm, QMIX, MADDPG, and RMAPPO, and also single-agent methods with shared parameters between agents such as IMPALA and APEX. The results show superior performance against other algorithms. The code is available online at https://github.com/kargarisaac/macrpo. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3389/frobt.2025.1566623,Frontiers in Robotics and AI,"Introduction: Mission-critical automation demands decision-making that is explainable, adaptive, and scalable—attributes elusive to purely symbolic or data-driven approaches. We introduce a hybrid intelligence (H-I) system that fuses symbolic reasoning with advanced machine learning via a hierarchical architecture, inspired by cognitive frameworks like Global Workspace Theory (Baars, A Cognitive Theory of Consciousness, 1988). Methods: This architecture operates across three levels to achieve autonomous, end-to-end workflows: Navigation: Using Vision Transformers, and graph-based neural networks, the system navigates file systems, databases, and software interfaces with precision. Discrete Actions: Multi-framework automated machine learning (AutoML) trains agents to execute discrete decisions, augmented by Transformers and Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) (Assran et al., 2023, 15619–15629) for complex time-series analysis, such as anomaly detection. Planning: Reinforcement learning, world model-based reinforcement learning, and model predictive control orchestrate adaptive workflows tailored to user requests or live system demands. Results: The system’s capabilities are demonstrated in two mission-critical applications: Space Domain Awareness, Satellite Behavior Detection: A graph-based JEPA paired with multi-agent reinforcement learning enables near real-time anomaly detection across 15,000 on-orbit objects, delivering a precision-recall score of 0.98. Autonomously Driven Simulation Setup: The system autonomously configures Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) setups, with an AutoML-driven optimizer enhancing the meshing step—boosting boundary layer capture propagation (BL-CP) from 8% to 98% and cutting geometry failure rates from 88% to 2% on novel aircraft geometries. Scalability is a cornerstone, with the distributed training pipeline achieving linear scaling across 2,000 compute nodes for AI model training, while secure model aggregation incurs less than 4% latency in cross-domain settings. Discussion: By blending symbolic precision with data-driven adaptability, this hybrid intelligence system offers a robust, transferable framework for automating complex knowledge work in domains like space operations and engineering simulations—and adjacent applications such as autonomous energy and industrial facility operations, paving the way for next-generation industrial AI systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3389/frobt.2025.1576348,Frontiers in Robotics and AI,"This paper presents the design and evaluation of a comprehensive system to develop voice-based interfaces to support users in supermarkets. These interfaces enable shoppers to convey their needs through both generic and specific queries. Although customisable state-of-the-art systems like GPTs from OpenAI are easily accessible and adaptable, featuring low-code deployment with options for functional integration, they still face challenges such as increased response times and limitations in strategic control for tailored use cases and cost optimization. Motivated by the goal of crafting equitable and efficient conversational agents with a touch of personalisation, this study advances on two fronts: 1) a comparative analysis of four popular off-the-shelf speech recognition technologies to identify the most accurate model for different genders (male/female) and languages (English/Dutch) and 2) the development and evaluation of a novel multi-LLM supermarket chatbot framework, comparing its performance with a specialized GPT model powered by the GPT-4 Turbo, using the Artificial Social Agent Questionnaire (ASAQ) and qualitative participant feedback. Our findings reveal that OpenAI’s Whisper leads in speech recognition accuracy between genders and languages and that our proposed multi-LLM chatbot architecture, which outperformed the benchmarked GPT model in performance, user satisfaction, user-agent partnership, and self-image enhancement, achieved statistical significance in these four key areas out of the 13 evaluated aspects that all showed improvements. The paper concludes with a simple method for supermarket robot navigation by mapping the final chatbot response to the correct shelf numbers to which the robot can plan sequential visits. Later, this enables the effective use of low-level perception, motion planning, and control capabilities for product retrieval and collection. We hope that this work encourages more efforts to use multiple specialized smaller models instead of always relying on a single powerful model. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3389/frobt.2025.1635419,Frontiers in Robotics and AI,"This study investigates the integration of individual human traits into an empathetically adaptive educational robot tutor system designed to improve student engagement and learning outcomes with corresponding Engagement Vector measurements. While prior research in the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has examined the integration of the traits, such as emotional intelligence, memory-driven personalization, and non-verbal communication, by themselves, they have thus-far neglected to consider their synchronized integration into a cohesive, operational education framework. To address this gap, we customize a Multi-Modal Large Language Model (Llama 3.2 from Meta) deployed with modules for human-like traits (emotion, memory and gestures) into an AI-Agent framework. This constitutes the robot’s intelligent core that mimics the human emotional system, memory architecture and gesture controller to allow the robot to behave more empathetically while recognizing and responding appropriately to the student’s emotional state. It can also recall the student’s past learning record and adapt its style of interaction accordingly. This allows the robot tutor to react to the student in a more sympathetic manner by delivering personalized verbal feedback synchronized with relevant gestures. Our study suggests the extent of this effect through the introduction of Engagement Vector Model which can be a benchmark for judging the quality of HRI experience. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that such an empathetic responsive approach significantly improves student engagement and learning outcomes compared with a baseline humanoid robot without these human-like traits. This indicates that robot tutors with empathetic capabilities can create a more supportive, interactive learning experience that ultimately leads to better outcomes for the student. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/aerospace9090488,Aerospace,"A system is considered in which agents (UAVs) must cooperatively discover interest-points (i.e., burning trees, geographical features) evolving over a grid. The objective is to locate as many interest-points as possible in the shortest possible time frame. There are two main problems: a control problem, where agents must collectively determine the optimal action, and a communication problem, where agents must share their local states and infer a common global state. Both problems become intractable when the number of agents is large. This survey/concept paper curates a broad selection of work in the literature pointing to a possible solution; a unified control/communication architecture within the framework of reinforcement learning. Two components of this architecture are locally interactive structure in the state-space, and hierarchical multi-level clustering for system-wide communication. The former mitigates the complexity of the control problem and the latter adapts to fundamental throughput constraints in wireless networks. The challenges of applying reinforcement learning to multi-agent systems are discussed. The role of clustering is explored in multi-agent communication. Research directions are suggested to unify these components. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/ai3030037,AI (Switzerland),"In this paper, a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) architecture, namely a “Hierarchical Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (HDDPG)” has been proposed and studied. A HDDPG utilizes manager and worker formation similar to other HRL structures. However, unlike others, the HDDPG enables sharing an identical environment and state among workers and managers, while a unique reward system is required for each Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent. Therefore, the HDDPG allows easy structural expansion with probabilistic action selection of a worker by the manager. Due to its innate structural advantage, the HDDPG has a merit in building a general AI to deal with a complex time-horizon tasks with various conflicting sub-goals. The experimental results demonstrated its usefulness with a manipulator motion planning problem in a dynamic environment, where path planning and collision avoidance conflict each other. The proposed HDDPG is compared with an HAM and a single DDPG for performance evaluation. The result shows that the HDDPG demonstrated more than 40% of reward gain and more than two times the reward improvement rate. Another important feature of the proposed HDDPG is the biased manager training capability. By adding a preference factor to each worker, the manager can be trained to prefer a certain worker to achieve better success rate for a specific objective if needed. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

By leveraging foundational concepts of value functions, policy optimization, and temporal difference methods, deep RL has rapidly evolved and found applications in areas such as gaming, robotics, finance, and healthcare. Objective: This paper seeks to provide a comprehensive yet accessible overview of the evolution of deep RL and its leading algorithms. It aims to serve both as an introduction for newcomers to the field and as a practical guide for those seeking to select the most appropriate methods for specific problem domains. Methods: We begin by outlining fundamental reinforcement learning principles, followed by an exploration of early tabular Q-learning methods. We then trace the historical development of deep RL, highlighting key milestones such as the advent of deep Q-networks (DQN). The survey extends to policy gradient methods, actor–critic architectures, and state-of-the-art algorithms such as proximal policy optimization, soft actor–critic, and emerging model-based approaches. Throughout, we discuss the current challenges facing deep RL, including issues of sample efficiency, interpretability, and safety, as well as open research questions involving large-scale training, hierarchical architectures, and multi-task learning. Results: Our analysis demonstrates how critical breakthroughs have driven deep RL into increasingly complex application domains. We highlight existing limitations and ongoing bottlenecks, such as high data requirements and the need for more transparent, ethically aligned systems.

10.3390/ai6030048,AI (Switzerland),"Background: The job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) and its solution algorithms have been of enduring interest in both academia and industry for decades. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been playing an increasingly important role in advancing existing solutions and building new heuristic solutions for the JSSP, aiming to find better solutions in shorter computation times. Methods: In this study, we built on top of a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent, called Neural Local Search (NLS), which can efficiently and effectively control a large local neighborhood search on the JSSP. In particular, we developed a method for training the decision transformer (DT) algorithm on search trajectories taken by a trained NLS agent to further improve upon the learned decision-making sequences. Results: Our experiments showed that the DT successfully learns local search strategies that are different and, in many cases, more effective than those of the NLS agent itself. In terms of the tradeoff between solution quality and acceptable computational time needed for the search, the DT is particularly superior in application scenarios where longer computational times are acceptable. In this case, it makes up for the longer inference times required per search step, which are caused by the larger neural network architecture, through better quality decisions per step. Conclusions: Therefore, the DT achieves state-of-the-art results for solving the JSSP with ML-enhanced local search. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/ai6050101,AI (Switzerland),"In today’s high-stakes arenas—from healthcare to defense—algorithms are advancing at an unprecedented pace, yet they still lack a crucial element of human decision-making: an instinctive caution that helps prevent harm. Inspired by both the protective reflexes seen in military robotics and the human amygdala’s role in threat detection, we introduce a novel idea: an integrated module that acts as an internal “caution system”. This module does not experience emotion in the human sense; rather, it serves as an embedded safeguard that continuously assesses uncertainty and triggers protective measures whenever potential dangers arise. Our proposed framework combines several established techniques. It uses Bayesian methods to continuously estimate the likelihood of adverse outcomes, applies reinforcement learning strategies with penalties for choices that might lead to harmful results, and incorporates layers of human oversight to review decisions when needed. The result is a system that mirrors the prudence and measured judgment of experienced clinicians—hesitating and recalibrating its actions when the data are ambiguous, much like a doctor would rely on both intuition and expertise to prevent errors. We call on computer scientists, healthcare professionals, and policymakers to collaborate in refining and testing this approach. Through joint research, pilot projects, and robust regulatory guidelines, we aim to ensure that advanced computational systems can combine speed and precision with an inherent predisposition toward protecting human life. Ultimately, by embedding this cautionary module, the framework is expected to significantly reduce AI-induced risks and enhance patient safety and trust in medical AI systems. It seems inevitable for future superintelligent AI systems in medicine to possess emotion-like processes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Currently, there is no standard to develop solutions using pervasive service composition. However, big companies propose their frameworks to develop complex services, but their frameworks are appropriate in specific applications, such as home automation and agricul-ture. On the other hand, there are different very well-grounded academic proposals for pervasive service composition. However, these do not solve the problems of traditional approaches that are appropriate to specific areas of application, and adaptation is needed to deal with the dynamism of the environment. This article presents a cognitive approach for pervasive service composition where InfoCom devices and the implementation of cognitive functions interact to create pervasive composite services. Our central hypothesis is that cognitive theory can help solve actual problems requiring pervasive service composition, as it addresses the above-mentioned problems. To test our approach, in this article we present a case of urban insecurity. Specifically, in different countries, street robbery using firearms is one of the problems with a high impact because of its frequency. This article proposes to compose a pervasive service for deterring criminals from committing their crimes. The results obtained by simulating our proposal in our case study are promising. However, more research needs to be achieved before applying the proposed approach to actual problems.

This paper implements a distributed architecture of an eco-friendly transport guidance system by employing the agent-based paradigm. The paradigm uses software agents to model and represent the complex transport infrastructure of urban environments, including roads, buses, trolleybuses, metros, trams, bicycles, and walking. The system exploits live traffic data (e.g., traffic flow, density, and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions) collected from multiple data sources (e.g., road sensors and SCOOT) to provide multimodal route recommendations for travelers through a dedicated application. Moreover, the proposed system empowers the transport management authorities to monitor the traffic flow and conditions of a city in real-time through a dedicated web visualization. We exhibit the advantages of using different types of agents to represent the versatile nature of transport networks and realize the concept of smart transportation. Commuters are supplied with multimodal routes that endeavor to reduce travel times and transport carbon footprint. A technical simulation was executed using various parameters to demonstrate the scalability of our multimodal traffic management architecture. Subsequently, two real user trials were carried out in Nottingham (United Kingdom) and Sofia (Bulgaria) to show the practicality and ease of use of our multimodal travel information system in providing eco-friendly route guidance.

As seen in the mission requirement, to combine the Maximum-Minimum ant colony optimization (ACO) with Vicsek based multi-agent system (MAS) to make an Artificially Intelligent (AI) scheme. In order to control and manage the different colonies, UAVs make a form of a network. The designed method overcomes the deficiencies of existing algorithms related to controlling and synchronizing the information globally. Furthermore, our designed architecture bounds, lemmatizes the pheromone, and finds the best ants which then make the most optimized path. The key contribution of this study is to merge two unique algorithms into a hybrid algorithm that has superior performance than both algorithms operating separately. Another contribution of the designed method is the ability to increase the number of individual agents inside the colony or the number of colonies with a good convergence rate. Lastly, we also compared the simulation results with the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) in order to prove the designed algorithm has a better convergence rate. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Most of these chatbots do not provide a human‐like conversation and fail to deliver the complete requested knowledge by the visitors. There are plenty of stand‐alone museum chatbots, developed using a chatbot platform, that provide predefined dialog routes. However, as chatbot platforms are evolving and AI technologies mature, new architectural approaches arise. Museums are already designing chatbots that are trained using machine learning techniques or chatbots connected to knowledge graphs, delivering more intelligent chatbots. This paper is surveying a representative set of developed museum chatbots and platforms for implementing them. More importantly, this paper presents the result of a systematic evaluation approach for evaluating both chatbots and platforms. Furthermore, the paper is introducing a novel approach in developing intelligent chatbots for museums. This approach emphasizes graph‐based, distributed, and collaborative multi‐chatbot conversational AI systems for museums. The paper accentuates the use of knowledge graphs as the key technology for potentially providing unlimited knowledge to chatbot users, satisfying conversational AI’s need for rich machine‐understandable content.

10.3390/app112210874,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),"The links between emotions and rationality have been extensively studied and discussed. Several computational approaches have also been proposed to model these links. However, is it possible to build generic computational approaches and languages so that they can be “adapted” when a specific affective phenomenon is being modeled? Would these approaches be sufficiently and properly grounded? In this work, we want to provide the means for the development of these generic approaches and languages by making a horizontal analysis inspired by philosophical and psychological theories of the main affective phenomena that are traditionally studied. Unfortunately, not all the affective theories can be adapted to be used in computational models; therefore, it is necessary to perform an analysis of the most suitable theories. In this analysis, we identify and classify the main processes and concepts which can be used in a generic affective computational model, and we propose a theoretical framework that includes all these processes and concepts that a model of an affective agent with practical reasoning could use. Our generic theoretical framework supports incremental research whereby future proposals can improve previous ones. This framework also supports the evaluation of the coverage of current computational approaches according to the processes that are modeled and according to the integration of practical reasoning and affect-related issues.

Yet, for low-resource languages, such as Azerbaijani, very little research has been conducted. The main purpose of this work is to experiment with various DMS pipeline set-ups to decide on the most appropriate natural language understanding and dialogue manager settings. In our project, we designed and evaluated different DMS pipelines with respect to the conversational text data obtained from one of the leading retail banks in Azerbaijan. In the work, the main two components of DMS—Natural language Understanding (NLU) and Dialogue Manager—have been investigated. In the first step of NLU, we utilized a language identification (LI) component for language detection. We investigated both built-in LI methods such as fastText and custom machine learning (ML) models trained on the domain-based dataset. The second step of the work was a comparison of the classic ML classifiers (logistic regression, neural networks, and SVM) and Dual Intent and Entity Transformer (DIET) architecture for user intention detection. In these experiments we used different combinations of feature extractors such as CountVectorizer, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) Vectorizer, and word embeddings for both word and character n-gram based tokens. To extract important information from the text messages, Named Entity Extraction (NER) component was added to the pipeline. The best NER model was chosen among conditional random fields (CRF) tagger, deep neural networks (DNN), models and build in entity extraction component inside DIET architecture. Obtained entity tags fed to the Dialogue Management module as features. All NLU set-ups were followed by the Dialogue Management module that contains a Rule-based Policy to handle FAQs and chitchats as well as a Transformer Embedding Dialogue (TED) Policy to handle more complex and unexpected dialogue inputs.

We performed multiple experiments where the agent had conversations with the humans. Results show an increase in personal semantic knowledge in the agent’s memory during conversations with an F1 score of 0.86.

This approach deviates from real-world problems in which humans only describe the object and its surroundings and allow the robot to ask for help when required. Vision-based Navigation with Language-based Assistance (VNLA) is a recently proposed task that requires an agent to navigate and find a target object according to a high-level language instruction. Due to the lack of step-by-step navigation guidance, the key to VNLA is to conduct goal-oriented exploration.

Consequently, the complexity of network management becomes higher, and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can improve AI-native network automation with their ability to solve complex problems. Specifically, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technologies are considered the key to intelligent network automation with a feedback mechanism similar to that of online closed-loop architecture. However, the 0-delay assumptions of the standard Markov decision process (MDP) of traditional DRL algorithms cannot directly be adopted into real-world networks because there exist random delays between the agent and the environment that will affect the performance significantly. To address this problem, this paper proposes a random-delay-corrected framework. We first abstract the scenario and model it as a partial history-dependent MDP (PH-MDP), and prove that it can be transformed to be the standard MDP solved by the traditional DRL algorithms. Then, we propose a random-delay-corrected DRL framework with a forward model and a delay-corrected trajectory sampling to obtain samples by continuous interactions to train the agent. Finally, we propose a delayed-deep-Q-network (delayed-DQN) algorithm based on the framework. For the evaluation, we develop a real-world cloud-native 5G core network prototype whose management architecture follows an online closed-loop mechanism. A use case on the top of the prototype namely delayed-DQN-enabled access and mobility management function (AMF) scaling is implemented for specific evaluations.

Specifically, it uses a reinforcement learning policy gradient algorithm to achieve a consensus among the agents.

The Asset Administration Shell (AAS) is a pilar component of I4.0 for the digital representation of assets and can be applied in both physical and digital assets, such as enterprise software, artificial intelligence (AI) agents, and databases. Multi-agent systems (MASs), in particular, are useful in the decentralized optimization of complex problems and applicable in various planning or scheduling scenarios that require the system’s ability to adapt to any given problem by using different optimization methods. In order to achieve this, a universal model for the agent’s information, communication, and behaviors should be provided in a way that is interoperable with the rest of the I4.0 assets and agents. To address these challenges, this work proposes an AAS-based information model for the description of scheduling agents. It allows multiple AI methods for scheduling, such as heuristics, mathematical programming, and deep reinforcement learning, to be encapsulated within a single agent, making it adjustable to different production scenarios. The software implementation of the proposed architecture aims to provide granularity in the deployment of scheduling agents which utilize the underlying AAS metamodel. The agent was implemented using the SARL agent-oriented programming (AOP) language and deployed in an open-source MAS platform. The system evaluation in a real-life bicycle production scenario indicated the agent’s ability to adapt and provide fast and accurate scheduling results. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/app14041609,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),"This article presents a model of an architecture of an artificial cognitive agent that performs the function of generating autoepistemic membership statements used to communicate beliefs about the belonging of an observed external object to a category with a prototype. The meaning of statements is described within the model by means of cognitive semantics. The presented proposal builds upon a pre-existing architecture and a semantic model designed for a simpler case of categories without a prototype. The main conclusion is that it is possible to develop an interactive cognitive agent capable of learning about categories with prototypes and producing autoepistemic membership statements fulfilling requirements of Rosch’s standard version of prototype semantics and satisfying pragmatic and logical rules for generating equivalents of these statements in natural languages. Detailed results include the following: an original proposal for an agent’s architecture, a model of an agent’s strategy of learning categories with a prototype, a scheme for determining the computational complexity of particular implementations of the learning strategy, definitions of cognitive semantics for particular cases of autoepistemic membership statements, and an analytical verification of properties of the proposed cognitive semantics.

10.3390/app14093682,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),"Optimal energy transmission dispatching of microgrid systems involves complicated transmission energy allocation and battery charging/discharging management and remains a difficult and challenging research problem subject to complex operation conditions and action constraints due to the randomness and volatility of new energy. Traditional microgrid transmission dispatching mainly considers the matching of the demand side and the supply side from a macro perspective, without considering the impact of line loss. Therefore, a Hierarchical Deep Q-network (HDQN) approach for microgrid energy dispatching is proposed to address this issue. The approach takes the power flow of each line and the battery charging/discharging behavior as decision variables to minimize the system operation cost. The proposed approach employs a two-layer agent optimization architecture for simultaneously processing the discrete and continuous variables, with one agent making upper layer decisions on the charging and discharging behavior of the batteries, and the other agent making lower layer decisions on the transmission energy allocation for the line. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach achieves better performance than existing approaches. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Therefore, this paper proposes an inductive learning architecture based on Graph Sample and Aggregate (GraphSAGE), which can significantly reduce the number of topology nodes to be trained, thereby reducing the computational complexity of the nodes. Then deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is employed for the continuous learning optimization of routing algorithms, and its generalization is improved by selecting GraphSAGE to construct the DRL agent. In the proposed graph neural-network-based routing optimization algorithm for LEO satellite networks, each Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent independently generates the hidden states of the nodes through the GraphSAGE model and uses them as inputs to the DRL model to make routing decisions. After a simulation and comparison, the proposed algorithm not only improves the overall network throughput, but also reduces the average end-to-end delay. The average throughput of the proposed algorithm increases by 29.47% and 18.42% compared to that of Dijkstra and the DQN, respectively. The average end-to-end delay is reduced by 39.76% and 15.29%, respectively, and can also adapt to changing topologies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

It is intended to provide the possibility of self-reconfiguration of systems to create more efficient and adaptive manufacturing processes. Achieving such goals requires the comprehensive integration of digital technologies with real production processes towards the creation of the so-called Cyber–Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). Their architecture is based on physical and cybernetic elements, with a digital twin as the central element of the “cyber” layer. However, for the responses obtained from the cyber layer, to allow for a quick response to changes in the environment of the production system, its virtual counterpart must be supplemented with advanced analytical modules. This paper proposes the method of creating a digital twin production system based on discrete simulation models integrated with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques for CPPSs.

The primary objective is to develop an environment-specific beam codebook composed of non-interfering beams, learned by cooperative agents within the MARL framework. Machine learning (ML)-based beam codebook design for downlink communications have been based on channel state information (CSI) feedback or only reference signal received power (RSRP), consisting of an offline training and user clustering phase. In massive MIMO, the full CSI feedback data is of large size and is resource-intensive to process, making it challenging to implement efficiently. RSRP alone for a stand-alone base station is not a good marker of the position of a receiver. Hence, in this work, uplink CSI estimated at the base station along with feedback of RSRP and binary acknowledgment of the accuracy of received data is utilized to design the beamforming codebook at the base station. Simulations using sub-array antenna and ray-tracing channel demonstrate the proposed system’s ability to learn topography-aware beam codebook for arbitrary beams serving multiple user groups simultaneously. The proposed method extends beyond mono-lobe and fixed beam architectures by dynamically adapting arbitrary shaped beams to avoid inter-beam interference, enhancing the overall system performance. This work leverages MARL’s potential in creating efficient beam codebooks for hybrid MIMO systems, paving the way for enhanced multiuser communication in future wireless networks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

The communication protocol, which is responsible for message exchange between agents, is crucial in cooperation. However, communicative MARL systems still face challenges due to the noisy messages in complex multi-agent decision processes. This issue often stems from the entangled representation of observations and messages in policy networks. To address this, we propose the Message Action Adapter Framework (MAAF), which first trains individual agents without message inputs and then adapts a residual action based on message components. This separation isolates the effect of messages on action inference. We explore how training the MAAF framework with model-agnostic message types and varying optimization strategies influences adaptation performance. The experimental results indicate that MAAF achieves competitive performance across multiple baselines despite utilizing only half of the available communication, and shows an average improvement of 7.6% over the full attention-based communication approach. Additional findings suggest that different message types result in significant performance variations, emphasizing the importance of environment-specific message types.

In the upper layer, the next frontier point for each robot is determined using Voronoi partitioning and the Multi-Agent Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (MATD3) deep reinforcement learning algorithm in a centralized training and decentralized execution framework. In the lower layer, navigation planning is achieved using A* and Timed Elastic Band (TEB) algorithms, while an improved Cartographer algorithm is used to construct a joint map for the multi-robot system.

To address these needs, we proposed a multi-agent system named Multi-Examiner, which integrates KGs, domain-specific search tools, and local knowledge bases, categorized according to Bloom’s taxonomy, to enhance the contextual relevance, diversity, and higher-order thinking of automatically generated information technology MCQs. Our methodology employed a mixed-methods approach combining system development with experimental evaluation.

We designed a multidimensional evaluation rubric to assess the semantic coherence, answer correctness, question validity, distractor relevance, question diversity, and higher-order thinking, and conducted a statistical analysis of ratings provided by 30 high school IT teachers. Results showed statistically significant improvements (p < 0.01) with Multi-Examiner outperforming GPT-4 by an average of 0.87 points (on a 5-point scale) for evaluation-level questions and 1.12 points for creation-level questions.

10.3390/app15116069,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),"In a multi-beam communication scenario where Infrastructure-to-Vehicle (I2V) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications coexist, the limited spectrum of resources force V2V users to reuse the orthogonal frequency bands allocated to I2V, inevitably introducing cross-layer interference between I2V and V2V. Furthermore, the adoption of a multi-beam communication architecture exacerbates beam interference, significantly degrading the overall network’s communication and sensing performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) beam allocation algorithm, termed IMSBA, which jointly optimizes beam direction, transmission power, and spectrum resource allocation to effectively mitigate the interference between I2V and V2V while maximizing the overall network performance. Specifically, IMSBA employs a joint optimization framework combining Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) with a Stackelberg game. Within this framework, MAPPO leverages vehicle perception data to dynamically optimize V2V beam steering and frequency selection, while the Stackelberg game reduces computational complexity through hierarchical decision-making and optimizes the joint power allocation among V2V users. Additionally, the proposed scheme incorporates a V2V cooperative sensing domain-sharing mechanism to enhance system robustness under adverse conditions. The experimental results demonstrated that, compared with existing baseline schemes, IMSBA achieved a 92.5% improvement in V2V energy efficiency while significantly enhancing both communication and sensing performance.

Yet large-scale deployment remains hindered by fragmented and proprietary datasets, unresolved privacy and cybersecurity risks associated with continuous IoT telemetry, the growing carbon and compute footprints of ever-larger models, and poor interoperability among legacy equipment and modern edge nodes.

In low-stakes settings this may be tolerable; in regulated or safety-critical domains such as financial services, compliance review, and client decision support, it is not. Motivated by these realities, we develop an integrated mitigation framework that layers complementary controls rather than relying on any single technique. The framework combines structured prompt design, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with verifiable evidence sources, and targeted fine-tuning aligned with domain truth constraints. Our interest in this problem is practical. Individual mitigation techniques have matured quickly, yet teams deploying LLMs in production routinely report difficulty stitching them together in a coherent, maintainable pipeline. Decisions about when to ground a response in retrieved data, when to escalate uncertainty, how to capture provenance, and how to evaluate fidelity are often made ad hoc. Drawing on experience from financial technology implementations, where even rare hallucinations can carry material cost, regulatory exposure, or loss of customer trust, we aim to provide clearer guidance in the form of an easy-to-follow tutorial. This paper makes four contributions. First, we introduce a three-layer reference architecture that organizes mitigation activities across input governance, evidence-grounded generation, and post-response verification. Second, we describe a lightweight supervisory agent that manages uncertainty signals and triggers escalation (to humans, alternate models, or constrained workflows) when confidence falls below policy thresholds. Third, we analyze common but under-addressed security surfaces relevant to hallucination mitigation, including prompt injection, retrieval poisoning, and policy evasion attacks.

Indeed, robots are part of daily life in multiple environments (i.e., cultural heritage sites, hospitals, offices, touristic scenarios and so on). In these contexts, robots have to coexist and interact with a wide spectrum of users not necessarily able or willing to adapt their interaction level to the kind requested by a machine: the users need to deal with artificial systems whose behaviors must be adapted as much as possible to the goals/needs of the users themselves, or more in general, to their mental states (beliefs, goals, plans and so on). In this paper, we introduce a cognitive architecture for adaptive and transparent human–robot interaction. The architecture allows a social robot to dynamically adjust its level of collaborative autonomy by restricting or expanding a delegated task on the basis of several context factors such as the mental states attributed to the human users involved in the interaction. This collaboration has to be based on different cognitive capabilities of the robot, i.e., the ability to build a user’s profile, to have a Theory of Mind of the user in terms of mental states attribution, to build a complex model of the context, intended both as a set of physical constraints and constraints due to the presence of other agents, with their own mental states. Based on the defined cognitive architecture and on the model of task delegation theorized by Castelfranchi and Falcone, the robot’s behavior is explainable by considering the abilities to attribute specific mental states to the user, the context in which it operates and its attitudes in adapting the level of autonomy to the user’s mental states and the context itself. The architecture has been implemented by exploiting the well known agent-oriented programming framework Jason.

10.3390/electronics14071294,Electronics (Switzerland),"Rapid advances in artificial intelligence are transforming high-stakes fields like medicine and education while raising pressing ethical challenges. This paper introduces the Ethical Firewall Architecture—a comprehensive framework that embeds mathematically provable ethical constraints directly into AI decision-making systems. By integrating formal verification techniques, blockchain-inspired cryptographic immutability, and emotion-like escalation protocols that trigger human oversight when needed, the architecture ensures that every decision is rigorously certified to align with core human values before implementation. The framework also addresses emerging issues, such as biased value systems in large language models and the risks associated with accelerated AI learning. In addition, it highlights the potential societal impacts—including workforce displacement—and advocates for new oversight roles like the Ethical AI Officer.

10.3390/electronics14091775,Electronics (Switzerland),"The increasing complexity of IT operations necessitates advanced automation to ensure system availability, resilience, continuity, performance, security, and maintainability. Traditional IT management frameworks, such as the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), have standardized service management processes, while models like IBM’s Process Reference Model for IT (PRM-IT) have facilitated automation through structured workflows. However, critical tasks, such as incident resolution and problem management, still require significant human intervention. The adoption of development, security, and operations (DevSecOps) introduced standardized remediation playbooks, further enhancing automation. More recently, Generative AI (GenAI) has expanded automation possibilities, opening new avenues for hyper-automated IT operations. This study explored Agentic Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (Agentic AIOps), an approach that integrates AI-driven agents to autonomously manage IT operations. Our methodology features a framework for designing and developing an Agentic AIOps system that proactively detects anomalies, classifies incidents, and autonomously executes resolution workflows across infrastructure, middleware, data, and applications in complex, heterogeneous Enterprise IT environments. Our findings suggest that such a system can significantly reduce incident response time, enhance predictive maintenance, and enable self-healing IT environments. By leveraging AI agents for real-time decision making, this approach enhances operational efficiency and reduces human workload. We conclude that this Agentic AIOps system represents a transformative step toward fully autonomous IT operations. We outline a framework for defining its architecture and planning its subsequent development, ensuring continuous evolution and adaptability in complex IT landscapes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/electronics14153008,Electronics (Switzerland),"With the accelerated digital transformation of the power industry, critical infrastructures such as power grids are increasingly migrating to cloud-native architectures, leading to unprecedented growth in service scale and complexity. Traditional operation and maintenance (O&M) methods struggle to meet the demands for real-time monitoring, accuracy, and scalability in such environments. This paper proposes a novel service performance anomaly detection system based on large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems (MAS). By integrating the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs with the distributed collaboration advantages of MAS, we construct a high-precision and robust anomaly detection framework. The system adopts a hierarchical architecture, where lower-layer agents are responsible for tasks such as log parsing and metric monitoring, while an upper-layer coordinating agent performs multimodal feature fusion and global anomaly decision-making. Additionally, the LLM enhances the semantic analysis and causal reasoning capabilities for logs. Experiments conducted on real-world data from the State Grid Corporation of China, covering 1289 service combinations, demonstrate that our proposed system significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of the F1-score across four platforms, including customer services and grid resources (achieving up to a 10.3% improvement). Notably, the system excels in composite anomaly detection and root cause analysis. This study provides an industrial-grade, scalable, and interpretable solution for intelligent power grid O&M, offering a valuable reference for the practical implementation of AIOps in critical infrastructures. Evaluated on real-world data from the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), our system achieves a maximum F1-score of 88.78%, with a precision of 92.16% and recall of 85.63%, outperforming five baseline methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/electronics14163178,Electronics (Switzerland),"In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing robots capable of explaining their behavior, thereby improving their acceptance by humans with whom they share their environment. Proposed software designs are typically based on the advances being made in conversational systems built on deep learning techniques. However, apart from the ability to formulate explanations, the robot also needs an internal episodic memory, where it stores information from the continuous stream of experiences. Most previous proposals are designed to deal with short streams of episodic data (several minutes long). With the aim of managing larger experiences, we propose in this work a high-level episodic memory, where relevant events are abstracted to natural language concepts. The proposed framework is intimately linked to a software architecture in which the explanations, whether externalized or not, are shaped internally in a collaborative process involving the task-oriented software agents that make up the architecture. The core of this process is a runtime knowledge model, employed as working memory whose evolution allows for capturing the causal events stored in the episodic memory. We present several use cases that illustrate how the suggested framework allows an autonomous robot to generate correct and relevant explanations of its actions and behavior. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/electronics14163320,Electronics (Switzerland),"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capability to solve practical problems through complex step-by-step reasoning. Specifically designed LLMs have begun to be integrated into terrestrial communication networks. However, relevant research in the field of satellite communications remains exceedingly rare. To address this gap, we introduce SCNOC-Agentic, a novel architecture especially designed to integrate the management and control of satellite communication systems in LLMs. SCNOC-Agentic incorporates four components tailored to the characteristics of satellite communications: intent refinement, multi-agent workflow, personalized long-term memory, and graph-based retrieval. Furthermore, we define four typical real-world scenarios that can be effectively addressed by integrating with LLMs: network task planning, carrier and cell optimization, fault analysis of satellites, and satellite management and control. Utilizing the SCNOC-Agentic framework, a series of open-source LLMs have achieved outstanding performance on the four tasks under various baselines, including zero-shot CoT, CoT-5, and self-consistency. For example, qwen2.5-70B with SCNOC-Agentic significantly improves the parameter generation accuracy in the network task planning task from 15.6% to 32.2%, while llama-3.3-70B increases from 16.2% to 29.0%. In addition, ablation studies were conducted to validate the importance of each proposed component within the SCNOC-Agentic framework. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/electronics14204058,Electronics (Switzerland),"Following the stablecoin legislation (GENIUS Act) enacted under the second Trump administration in 2025, blockchain has become core digital economy infrastructure. However, privacy risks from decentralization and transparency constrain adoption in regulated industries, requiring solutions that harmonize blockchain architecture with regulatory compliance. Existing research relies on reactive auditing or post-execution rule checking, which wastes computational resources or provides only basic encryption or access controls without comprehensive privacy compliance. The proposed Artificial Intelligence-enhanced Regulatory Proof-of-Compliance (AIRPoC) framework addresses this gap through a two-phase consensus mechanism that integrates AI legal agents with semantic web technologies for autonomous regulatory compliance enforcement. Unlike existing research, AIRPoC implements a dual-layer architecture where AI-powered regulatory validation precedes consensus execution, ensuring that only compliant transactions proceed to blockchain finalization. The system employs AI legal agents that automatically construct and update regulatory databases via multi-oracle networks, using SPARQL-based inference engines for real-time General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance validation. A simulation-based experimental evaluation conducted across 24 tests with 116,200 transactions in a controlled environment demonstrates 88.9% compliance accuracy, with 9502 transactions per second (TPS) versus 11,192 TPS for basic Proof-of-Stake (PoS) (4.5% overhead).

10.3390/electronics9091363,Electronics (Switzerland),"Driven by the recent technological advancements within the field of artificial intelligence research, deep learning has emerged as a promising representation learning technique across all of the machine learning classes, especially within the reinforcement learning arena. This new direction has given rise to the evolution of a new technological domain named deep reinforcement learning, which combines the representational learning power of deep learning with existing reinforcement learning methods. Undoubtedly, the inception of deep reinforcement learning has played a vital role in optimizing the performance of reinforcement learning-based intelligent agents with model-free based approaches. Although these methods could improve the performance of agents to a greater extent, they were mainly limited to systems that adopted reinforcement learning algorithms focused on learning a single task. At the same moment, the aforementioned approach was found to be relatively data-inefficient, particularly when reinforcement learning agents needed to interact with more complex and rich data environments. This is primarily due to the limited applicability of deep reinforcement learning algorithms to many scenarios across related tasks from the same environment. The objective of this paper is to survey the research challenges associated with multi-tasking within the deep reinforcement arena and present the state-of-the-art approaches by comparing and contrasting recent solutions, namely DISTRAL (DIStill & TRAnsfer Learning), IMPALA(Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architecture) and PopArt that aim to address core challenges such as scalability, distraction dilemma, partial observability, catastrophic forgetting and negative knowledge transfer. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/engproc2025092040,Engineering Proceedings,"With the increasing popularity of online education platforms, the use frequency of students and teachers has gradually increased. A large volume of data is generated and analyzed daily on these platforms including course information and student learning status. However, traditional analysis methods often require substantial manpower and expertise. Large language models Chat GPT-4 offer a potential solution to this problem. This study aims to address this challenge by utilizing the large-scale language model framework LangChain and the database of the OpenEdu online education platform. We designed an interface capable of querying educational data in natural language. When a user queries in natural language, the large language model generates structured query language to query the database and converts the query back into natural language to respond to the user’s question. Two different query methods were developed based on LangChain components: the sequential query version and the Agent query version. Based on these methods, four different versions of prompt and model combinations were created. The accuracy in converting natural language to SQL was estimated, and error type analysis was conducted to enhance the system’s performance and accuracy. The execution accuracy reached up to 85.7%, with the primary error type in natural language-generated SQL being Schema Linking. By integrating large-scale language models into conversational query systems, a promising approach was developed for handling large-scale data queries on educational platforms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/engproc2025100056,Engineering Proceedings,"In this article, two generalized net models (GNMs) are proposed to study the behavior and effectiveness of intelligent virtual agents (IVA) working in a risky environment under different scenarios and training algorithms. The proposed GNMs allow for the selection of machine learning algorithms such as intensity of characteristics Q-learning (InCh-Q), as well as the modification of multi-plan reinforcement learning (RL), proximal policy optimization (PPO), soft actor–critic (SAC), the generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) algorithm, and behavioral cloning (CB). The choice of action, the change in priorities, and the achievement of goals by the IVA are studied under different scenarios, such as fire extinguishing, rescue operations, evacuation, patrolling, and training. Transitions in the GNMs represent the scenarios and learning algorithms. The tokens that pass through the GNMs can be the GNMs of the IVA architecture or the IVA memory model, which are enriched with knowledge and experience during the experiments, as the scenarios develop. The proposed GNMs are formally correct and, at the same time, understandable, practically applicable, and convenient for interpretation. Achieving GNMs that meet these requirements is a complex problem. Therefore, issues related to the design and use of GNMs for the reliable modeling and analysis of the behavior and effectiveness of IVAs operating in a dynamic and risky environment are discussed. Some advantages and challenges in using GNMs compared to other classical models used to study IVA behavior are considered. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/fi14080230,Future Internet,"Recently, a multi-agent based network automation architecture has been proposed. The architecture is named multi-agent based network automation of the network management system (MANA-NMS). The architectural framework introduced atomized network functions (ANFs). ANFs should be autonomous, atomic, and intelligent agents. Such agents should be implemented as an independent decision element, using machine/deep learning (ML/DL) as an internal cognitive and reasoning part. Using these atomic and intelligent agents as a building block, a MANA-NMS can be composed using the appropriate functions. As a continuation toward implementation of the architecture MANA-NMS, this paper presents a network traffic prediction agent (NTPA) and a network traffic classification agent (NTCA) for a network traffic management system. First, an NTPA is designed and implemented using DL algorithms, i.e., long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms as a reasoning and cognitive part of the agent. Similarly, an NTCA is designed using decision tree (DT), K-nearest neighbors (K-NN), support vector machine (SVM), and naive Bayes (NB) as a cognitive component in the agent design. We then measure the NTPA prediction accuracy, training latency, prediction latency, and computational resource consumption. The results indicate that the LSTM-based NTPA outperforms compared to GRU, MLP, and CNN-based NTPA in terms of prediction accuracy, and prediction latency. We also evaluate the accuracy of the classifier, training latency, classification latency, and computational resource consumption of NTCA using the ML models. The performance evaluation shows that the DT-based NTCA performs the best. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/fi17040180,Future Internet,"E-commerce applications have emerged as key drivers of digital transformation, reshaping consumer behavior and driving demand for seamless online transactions. Despite the growth of smart mobile technologies, existing methods rely on fixed UI content that cannot adjust to local cultural preferences and fluctuating user behaviors. This paper explores the combination of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies with Model-Driven Development (MDD) to enhance personalization, engagement, and adaptability in e-commerce. Unlike static adaptation approaches, generative AI enables real-time, adaptive interactions tailored to individual needs, providing a more engaging and adaptable user experience. The proposed framework follows a three-tier architecture: first, it collects and analyzes user behavior data from UI interactions; second, it leverages MDD to model and personalize user personas and interactions and third, AI techniques, including generative AI and multi-agent reinforcement learning, are applied to refine and optimize UI/UX design. This automation-driven approach uses a multi-agent system to continuously enhance AI-generated layouts. Technical validation demonstrated strong user engagement across diverse platforms and superior performance in UI optimization, achieving an average user satisfaction improvement of 2.3% compared to GAN-based models, 18.6% compared to Bootstrap-based designs, and 11.8% compared to rule-based UI adaptation.

10.3390/fi17080353,Future Internet,"Data annotation serves as a critical foundation for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Recently, AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have emerged as effective solutions to longstanding challenges in data annotation, such as scalability, consistency, cost, and limitations in domain expertise. These agents facilitate intelligent automation and adaptive decision-making, thereby enhancing the efficiency and reliability of annotation workflows across various fields. Despite the growing interest in this area, a systematic understanding of the role and capabilities of AI agents in annotation is still underexplored. This paper seeks to fill that gap by providing a comprehensive review of how LLM-driven agents support advanced reasoning strategies, adaptive learning, and collaborative annotation efforts. We analyze agent architectures, integration patterns within workflows, and evaluation methods, along with real-world applications in sectors such as healthcare, finance, technology, and media. Furthermore, we evaluate current tools and platforms that support agent-based annotation, addressing key challenges such as quality assurance, bias mitigation, transparency, and scalability.

10.3390/fi17080363,Future Internet,"Current agentic AI frameworks such as LangGraph and AutoGen simulate autonomy via sequential prompt chaining but lack true multi-agent coordination architectures. These systems conflate semantic reasoning with orchestration, requiring LLMs at every coordination step and limiting scalability. By contrast, TB-CSPN (Topic-Based Communication Space Petri Net) is a hybrid formal architecture that fundamentally separates semantic processing from coordination logic. Unlike traditional Petri net applications, where the entire system state is encoded within the network structure, TB-CSPN uses Petri nets exclusively for coordination workflow modeling, letting communication and interaction between agents drive semantically rich, topic-based representations. At the same time, unlike first-generation agentic frameworks, here LLMs are confined to topic extraction, with business logic coordination implemented by structured token communication. This hybrid architectural separation preserves human strategic oversight (as supervisors) while delegating consultant and worker roles to LLMs and specialized AI agents, avoiding the state-space explosion typical of monolithic formal systems. Our empirical evaluation shows that TB-CSPN achieves 62.5% faster processing, 66.7% fewer LLM API calls, and 167% higher throughput compared to LangGraph-style orchestration, without sacrificing reliability. Scaling experiments with 10–100 agents reveal sub-linear memory growth (10× efficiency improvement), directly contradicting traditional Petri Net scalability concerns through our semantic-coordination-based architectural separation. These performance gains arise from the hybrid design, where coordination patterns remain constant while semantic spaces scale independently. TB-CSPN demonstrates that efficient agentic AI emerges not by over-relying on modern AI components but by embedding them strategically within a hybrid architecture that combines formal coordination guarantees with semantic flexibility. Our implementation and evaluation methodology are openly available, inviting community validation and extension of these principles. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

This study provides a clear review of agentic AI systems by bringing together their definitions, frameworks, and architectures, and by comparing them with related areas like generative AI, autonomic computing, and multi-agent systems. To do this, we reviewed 143 primary studies on current LLM-based and non-LLM-driven agentic systems and examined how they support planning, memory, reflection, and goal pursuit. Furthermore, we classified architectural models, input–output mechanisms, and applications based on their task domains where agentic AI is applied, supported using tabular summaries that highlight real-world case studies. Evaluation metrics were classified as qualitative and quantitative measures, along with available testing methods of agentic AI systems to check the system’s performance and reliability.

10.3390/info11040179,Information (Switzerland),"Intelligent agents have the potential to understand personality traits of human beings because of their every day interaction with us. The assessment of our psychological traits is a useful tool when we require them to simulate empathy. Since the creation of social media platforms, numerous studies dealt with measuring personality traits by gathering users' information from their social media profiles. Real world applications showed how natural language processing combined with supervised machine learning algorithms are effective in this field. These applications have some limitations such as focusing on English text only and not considering polysemy in text. In this paper, we propose a multilingual model that handles polysemy by analyzing sentences as a semantic ensemble of interconnected words. The proposed approach processes Facebook posts from the myPersonality dataset and it turns them into a high-dimensional array of features, which are then exploited by a deep neural network architecture based on transformer to perform regression. We prove the effectiveness of our work by comparing the mean squared error of our model with existing baselines and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the relative data distributions. We obtained state-of-the-art results in personality traits estimation from social media posts for all five personality traits. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

10.3390/info14080441,Information (Switzerland),"A major challenge in cognitive science and AI has been to understand how intelligent autonomous agents might acquire and predict the behavioral and mental states of other agents in the course of complex social interactions. How does such an agent model the goals, beliefs, and actions of other agents it interacts with? What are the computational principles to model a Theory of Mind (ToM)? Deep learning approaches to address these questions fall short of a better understanding of the problem. In part, this is due to the black-box nature of deep networks, wherein computational mechanisms of ToM are not readily revealed. Here, we consider alternative hypotheses seeking to model how the brain might realize a ToM. In particular, we propose embodied and situated agent models based on distributed adaptive control theory to predict the actions of other agents in five different game-theoretic tasks (Harmony Game, Hawk-Dove, Stag Hunt, Prisoner’s Dilemma, and Battle of the Exes). Our multi-layer control models implement top-down predictions from adaptive to reactive layers of control and bottom-up error feedback from reactive to adaptive layers. We test cooperative and competitive strategies among seven different agent models (cooperative, greedy, tit-for-tat, reinforcement-based, rational, predictive, and internal agents). We show that, compared to pure reinforcement-based strategies, probabilistic learning agents modeled on rational, predictive, and internal phenotypes perform better in game-theoretic metrics across tasks. The outlined autonomous multi-agent models might capture systems-level processes underlying a ToM and suggest architectural principles of ToM from a control-theoretic perspective. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

The attention mechanism is added in the decoder to improve the problem of accuracy decreasing as the sentence grows in length. We conducted four experiments. The first is an ablation experiment demonstrating that the Seq2Seq + Bi-directional LSTM + Attention mechanism is superior to LSTM, Seq2Seq, Seq2Seq + Attention mechanism in natural language processing. Using an open-source Chinese corpus for testing, the accuracy was 82.1%, 63.4%, 69.2%, and 76.1%, respectively. The second experiment uses knowledge of the target domain to ask questions.

The digital transformation of language education demands innovative approaches that combine pedagogical rigor with explainable AI (XAI) principles, particularly for low-resource languages. This paper presents a novel methodology that integrates Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) with Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to create transparent, workflow-driven language tutors. Our approach uniquely embeds XAI through three mechanisms: (1) BPMN’s visual formalism that makes agent decision-making auditable, (2) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with verifiable knowledge provenance from textbooks of the National Institute of Languages of Luxembourg, and (3) human-in-the-loop validation of both content and pedagogical sequencing. To ensure realism in learner interaction, we integrate speech-to-text and text-to-speech technologies, creating an immersive, human-like learning environment. The system simulates intelligent tutoring through agents’ collaboration and dynamic adaptation to learner progress. We demonstrate this framework through a Luxembourgish language learning platform where specialized agents (Conversational, Reading, Listening, QA, and Grammar) operate within BPMN-modeled workflows. The system achieves high response faithfulness (0.82) and relevance (0.85) according to RAGA metrics, while speech integration using Whisper STT and Coqui TTS enables immersive practice. Evaluation with learners showed 85.8% satisfaction with contextual responses and 71.4% engagement rates, confirming the effectiveness of our process-driven approach. This work advances AI-powered language education by showing how formal process modeling can create pedagogically coherent and explainable tutoring systems.

10.3390/jmse10050585,Journal of Marine Science and Engineering,"Ship collisions often result in huge losses of life, cargo and ships, as well as serious pollution of the water environment. Meanwhile, it is estimated that between 75% and 86% of maritime accidents are related to human factors. Thus, it is necessary to enhance the intelligence of ships to partially or fully replace the traditional piloting mode and eventually achieve autonomous collision avoidance to reduce the influence of human factors. In this paper, we propose a multi-ship automatic collision avoidance method based on a double deep Q network (DDQN) with prioritized experience replay. Firstly, we vectorize the predicted hazardous areas as the observation states of the agent so that similar ship encounter scenarios can be clustered and the input dimension of the neural network can be fixed. The reward function is designed based on the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at Sea (COLREGs) and human experience. Different from the architecture of previous collision avoidance methods based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), in this paper, the interaction between the agent and the environment occurs only in the collision avoidance decision-making phase, which greatly reduces the number of state transitions in the Markov decision process (MDP). The prioritized experience replay method is also used to make the model converge more quickly. Finally, 19 singlevessel collision avoidance scenarios were constructed based on the encounter situations classified by the COLREGs, which were arranged and combined as the training set for the agent. The effectiveness of the proposed method in close-quarters situation was verified using the Imazu problem. The simulation results show that the method can achieve multi-ship collision avoidance in crowded waters, and the decisions generated by this method conform to the COLREGs and are close to the level of human ship handling. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/jmse13010020,Journal of Marine Science and Engineering,"Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is characterized by its simple structure and strong adaptability, which has led to its widespread application in the field of path planning. To address the challenge of optimal path planning for mobile agent clusters in uncertain environments, a multi-objective dynamic path planning model (MODPP) based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) has been proposed. This model is suitable for complex, unstable task environments characterized by dimensionality explosion and offers scalability. The approach consists of two components: an action evaluation module and an action decision module, utilizing a centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) training architecture. During the training process, agents within the cluster learn cooperative strategies while being able to communicate with one another. Consequently, they can navigate through task environments without communication, achieving collision-free paths that optimize multiple sub-objectives globally, minimizing time, distance, and overall costs associated with turning. Furthermore, in real-task execution, agents acting as mobile entities can perform real-time obstacle avoidance. Finally, based on the OpenAI Gym platform, environments such as simple multi-objective environment and complex multi-objective environment were designed to analyze the rationality and effectiveness of the multi-objective dynamic path planning through minimum cost and collision risk assessments. Additionally, the impact of reward function configuration on agent strategies was discussed. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/jmse13071271,Journal of Marine Science and Engineering,"To address the challenges of real-time decision-making and resource optimization in multi-agent cooperative interception tasks within dynamic environments, this paper proposes a hierarchical framework for reinforcement learning-based interception algorithm (HFRL-IA). By constructing a hierarchical Markov decision process (MDP) model based on dynamic game equilibrium theory, the complex interception task is decomposed into two hierarchically optimized stages: dynamic task allocation and distributed path planning. At the high level, a sequence-to-sequence reinforcement learning approach is employed to achieve dynamic bipartite graph matching, leveraging a graph neural network encoder–decoder architecture to handle dynamically expanding threat targets. At the low level, an improved prioritized experience replay multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (PER-MADDPG) is designed, integrating curriculum learning and prioritized experience replay mechanisms to effectively enhance the interception success rate against complex maneuvering targets. Extensive simulations in diverse scenarios and comparisons with conventional task assignment strategies demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. Taking a typical scenario of 10 agents intercepting as an example, the HFRL-IA algorithm achieves a 22.51% increase in training rewards compared to the traditional end-to-end MADDPG algorithm, and the interception success rate is improved by 26.37%.

10.3390/jmse13081593,Journal of Marine Science and Engineering,"Coordinating Multi-Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) swarms in complex, adversarial maritime environments is a significant challenge, as existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods often fail to capture intricate spatiotemporal dependencies, leading to suboptimal policies. To address this, we propose Adv-TransAC, a novel Spatio-Temporal Meta-Reinforcement Learning framework. Its core innovation is a hybrid GAT-transformer architecture that decouples spatial and temporal reasoning: a Graph Attention Network (GAT) models instantaneous tactical formations, while a transformer analyzes their temporal evolution to infer intent. This is combined with an adversarial meta-learning mechanism to enable rapid adaptation to opponent tactics. In high-fidelity escort and defense simulations, Adv-TransAC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MARL baselines in task success rate and policy robustness. The learned policies demonstrate the emergence of complex cooperative behaviors, such as intelligent risk-aware coordination and proactive interception maneuvers. The framework’s practicality is further validated by a communication-efficient federated optimization architecture. By effectively modeling spatiotemporal dynamics and enabling rapid adaptation, Adv-TransAC provides a powerful solution that moves beyond reactive decision-making, establishing a strong foundation for next-generation, intelligent maritime platforms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/JSAN10030042,Journal of Sensor and Actuator Networks,"The evolution of driving technology has recently progressed from active safety features and ADAS systems to fully sensor-guided autonomous driving. Bringing such a vehicle to market requires not only simulation and testing but formal verification to account for all possible traffic scenarios. A new verification approach, which combines the use of two well-known model checkers: model checker for multi-agent systems (MCMAS) and probabilistic model checker (PRISM), is presented for this purpose. The overall structure of our autonomous vehicle (AV) system consists of: (1) A perception system of sensors that feeds data into (2) a rational agent (RA) based on a belief–desire–intention (BDI) architecture, which uses a model of the environment and is connected to the RA for verification of decision-making, and (3) a feedback control systems for following a self-planned path. MCMAS is used to check the consistency and stability of the BDI agent logic during design-time. PRISM is used to provide the RA with the probability of success while it decides to take action during run-time operation. This allows the RA to select movements of the highest probability of success from several generated alternatives. This framework has been tested on a new AV software platform built using the robot operating system (ROS) and virtual reality (VR) Gazebo Simulator. It also includes a parking lot scenario to test the feasibility of this approach in a realistic environment.

The structure of the MADRL system consists of various clusters of agents. The deep Q-network (DQN) architecture presents the first cluster’s agent structure. The other clusters are considered as the environment of the first cluster’s DQN agent. We introduce two novel observations in data transmission, termed on-time and time-delay observations. The proposed observations are considered when the data transmission channel is idle, and the data is transmitted on time or delayed. By considering the distance between the neighboring agents, we present a novel immediate reward function by appending a distance-based reward to the previously utilized reward to improve the MADRL system performance. We consider three types of gradient-based attacks to investigate the robustness of the proposed system data transmission. Two defense methods are proposed to reduce the effects of the discussed malicious attacks. We have rigorously shown the system performance based on the DQN loss and the team reward for the entire team of agents.

10.3390/jsan14010020,Journal of Sensor and Actuator Networks,"High route loss and line-of-sight requirements are two of the fundamental challenges of millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communications that are mitigated by incorporating sensor technology. Sensing gives the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent comprehensive environmental feedback, which helps it better predict channel fluctuations and modify beam patterns accordingly. For multi-user massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems, hybrid precoding requires sophisticated real-time low-complexity power allocation (PA) approaches to achieve near-optimal capacity. This study presents a unique angular-based hybrid precoding (AB-HP) framework that minimizes radio frequency (RF) chain and channel estimation while optimizing energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE). DRL is essential for mm-wave technology to make adaptive and intelligent decision-making possible, which effectively transforms wireless communication systems. DRL optimizes RF chain usage to maintain excellent SE while drastically lowering hardware complexity and energy consumption in an AB-HP architecture by dynamically learning optimal precoding methods using environmental angular information. This article proposes enabling dual optimization of EE and SE while drastically lowering beam training overhead by incorporating maximum reward beam training driven (RBT) in the DRL. The proposed RBT-DRL improves system performance and flexibility by dynamically modifying the number of active RF chains in dynamic network situations. The simulation results show that RBT-DRL-driven beam training guarantees good EE performance for mobile users while increasing SE in mm-wave structures. Even though total power consumption rises by 45%, the SE improves by 39%, increasing from 14 dB to 20 dB, suggesting that this strategy could successfully achieve a balance between performance and EE in upcoming B5G networks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

In this project we sought to build a BDI agent for use in the real world for campus mail delivery in the tunnel system at Carleton University. Ideally, the robot should receive a delivery order via a mobile application, pick up the mail at a station, navigate the tunnels to the destination station, and notify the recipient. In this paper, we discuss how we linked the Robot Operating System (ROS) with a BDI reasoning system to achieve a subset of the required use casesand demonstrated the system performance in an analogue environment. ROS handles the connections to the low-level sensors and actuators, while the BDI reasoning system handles the high-level reasoning and decision making. Sensory data is sent to the reasoning system as perceptions using ROS. These perceptions are then deliberated upon, and an action string is sent back to ROS for interpretation and driving of the necessary actuator for the action to be performed.

Using real-world retail demand data enriched with synthetic sustainability attributes, we trained a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate plausible future demand scenarios. These were used to seed a Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) aimed at identifying Pareto-optimal sourcing strategies that balance delivery cost and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. The resulting Pareto frontier revealed favorable trade-offs, enabling up to 50% emission reductions for only a 10–15% cost increase. We further deployed a deep Q-learning (DQN) agent to dynamically manage weekly shipments under a selected balanced strategy.

10.3390/machines10121169,Machines,"Recently, manufacturing companies have been making efforts to increase resource utilization while ensuring the flexibility of production lines to respond to rapidly changing market environments and customer demand. In the high-tech manufacturing industry, which requires expensive manufacturing facilities and is capital-intensive, re-entrant production lines are used for efficient production with limited resources. In such a production system, a part visits a specific station repeatedly during the production period. However, a re-entrant production line requires an appropriate scheduling system because other parts with different processing requirements are processed at the same station. In this study, a re-entrant production line was modeled as a manufacturing environment via simulation, and an adaptive scheduling system was developed to improve its operational performance by applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL). To achieve this, a software architecture for integrating DRL with the simulation was developed and the states, actions, and rewards of the reinforcement learning (RL) agent were defined. Moreover, a discrete-event simulation control module was designed to collect data from the simulation model and evaluate the policy network trained via DRL.

In this work, we propose cascaded constrained residual reinforcement learning (RL), an intuitive method that allows to improve the performance of a cascaded control structure while maintaining safe operation at all times. We draw inspiration from the constrained residual RL framework, in which a constrained reinforcement learning agent learns corrective adaptations to a base controller’s output to increase optimality. We first revisit the interplay between the residual agent and the baseline controller and subsequently extend this to the cascaded case. We analyze the differences and challenges this structure brings and derive some principle insights from this into the stability and operation of the cascaded residual architecture. Next, we propose a novel actor structure to enable efficient learning under the cascaded setting. We show that the standard algorithm is suboptimal for application to cascaded control structures and validate our method on a high-fidelity simulator of a dual motor drivetrain, resulting in a performance improvement of 14.7% on average, with only a minor decrease in performance occurring during the training phase. We study the different principles constituting the method and examine and validate their contribution to the algorithm’s performance under the considered cascaded control structure. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Enhancing their control systems under conditions of user variability and dynamic disturbances remains a significant challenge, particularly in active-assist modes. This study presents a human-in-the-loop control architecture for a pediatric lower-limb exoskeleton, combining outer-loop admittance control with robust inner-loop trajectory tracking via a non-singular terminal sliding-mode (NSTSM) controller. Designed for active-assist gait rehabilitation in children aged 8–12 years, the exoskeleton dynamically responds to user interaction forces while ensuring finite-time convergence under system uncertainties. To enhance adaptability, we augment the inner-loop control with a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) reinforcement learning framework. The actor–critic RL agent tunes NSTSM gains in real-time, enabling personalized model-free adaptation to subject-specific gait dynamics and external disturbances. The numerical simulations show improved trajectory tracking, with RMSE reductions of 27.82% (hip) and 5.43% (knee), and IAE improvements of 40.85% and 10.20%, respectively, over the baseline NSTSM controller. The proposed approach also reduced the peak interaction torques across all the joints, suggesting more compliant and comfortable assistance for users. While minor degradation is observed at the ankle joint, the TD3-NSTSM controller demonstrates improved responsiveness and stability, particularly in high-load joints.

Also, it is well-known that the correct employment of parameter values in this kind of method can positively impact their performance and behavior. In this context, the present work focuses on the design of a hybrid architecture which smartly balances the population size on run-time. In order to smartly balance and control the population size, a modular approach, named Linear Modular Population Balancer (LMPB), is proposed. The main ideas behind the designed architecture include the solving strategy behind a population-based metaheuristic, the influence of learning components based on multiple statistical modeling methods which transform the dynamic data generated into knowledge, and the possibilities to tackle both discrete and continuous optimization problems.

On the one hand, a scene typically includes different traffic participants, such as vehicles, buses, pedestrians, and cyclists, which may behave differently. On the other hand, an agent may have multiple plausible future trajectories based on complex interactions with the other agents. To address these challenges, we propose a multiagent, multimodal trajectory prediction method based on neural networks, which encodes past motion information, group context, and road context to estimate future trajectories by learning from the interactions of the agents. At inference time, multiple realistic future trajectories are predicted. Our solution is based on an encoder–decoder architecture that can handle a variable number of traffic participants.

Despite this, existing approaches often rely solely on single-scaling daily data, neglecting the importance of multi-scaling information, such as weekly or monthly data, in decision-making processes. To address this limitation, a multi-scaling convolutional neural network for reinforcement learning-based stock trading, termed multi-scaling convolutional neural network SARSA (state, action, reward, state, action), is proposed. Our method utilizes a multi-scaling convolutional neural network to obtain multi-scaling features of daily and weekly financial data automatically. This involves using a convolutional neural network with several filter sizes to perform a multi-scaling extraction of temporal features. Multiple-scaling feature mining allows agents to operate over longer time scaling, identifying low stock positions on the weekly line and avoiding daily fluctuations during continuous declines. This mimics the human approach of considering information at varying temporal and spatial scaling during stock trading. We further enhance the network’s robustness by adding an average pooling layer to the backbone convolutional neural network, reducing overfitting. State, action, reward, state, action, as an on-policy reinforcement learning method, generates dynamic trading strategies that combine multi-scaling information across different time scaling, while avoiding dangerous strategies.

Feature attribution methods—including SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Elasticity-Based Feature Importance (EFI), and Permutation Feature Importance (PFI)—highlighted the dominant influence of cement content and curing age, as well as revealing non-intuitive effects such as the compensatory role of superplasticizers in low-water mixtures. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach to support intelligent concrete mix design and real-time optimization in smart construction environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/mti4030055,Multimodal Technologies and Interaction,"Virtual agents that improve the lives of humans need to be more than user-aware and adaptive to the user’s current state and behavior. Additionally, they need to apply expertise gained from experience that drives their adaptive behavior based on deep understanding of the user’s features (such as gender, culture, personality, and psychological state). Our work has involved extension of FAtiMA (Fearnot AffecTive Mind Architecture) with the addition of an Adaptive Engine to the FAtiMA cognitive agent architecture. We use machine learning to acquire the agent’s expertise by capturing a collection of user profiles into a user model and development of agent expertise based on the user model. In this paper, we describe a study to evaluate the Adaptive Engine, which compares the benefit (i.e., reduced stress, increased rapport) of tailoring dialogue to the specific user (Adaptive group) with dialogues that are either empathic (Empathic group) or neutral (Neutral group). Results showed a significant reduction in stress in the empathic and neutral groups, but not the adaptive group. Analyses of rule accuracy, participants’ dialogue preferences, and individual differences reveal that the three groups had different needs for empathic dialogue and highlight the importance and challenges of getting the tailoring right. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

The goal of IMPERA was to realize an extraterrestrial exploration scenario using a heterogeneous multi-robot system. The main challenge was the development of a multi-robot planning and plan execution architecture. The robot team consists of three heterogeneous robots, which have to explore an unknown environment and collect lunar drill samples. The team activities are described using the language ALICA (A Language for Interactive Agents). Furthermore, we use the mission planning system pRoPhEt MAS (Reactive Planning Engine for Multi-Agent Systems) to provide an intuitive interface to generate team activities. Therefore, we define the basic skills of our team with ALICA and define the desired goal states by using a logic description. Based on the skills, pRoPhEt MAS creates a valid ALICA plan, which will be executed by the team. The paper describes the basic components for communication, coordinated exploration, perception and object transportation. Finally, we evaluate the planning engine pRoPhEt MAS in the IMPERA scenario.

Emerging cooperation between unknown robots is still rare and limited. Such cooperation might be basic like sharing sensor data or complex like conjoined motion planning and acting. Robots should be able to detect other robots and their abilities during runtime. When cooperation seems to be possible and beneficial, it should be initiated autonomously. A centralized cloud control shall be avoided. Using software patterns belonging to service-oriented architectures, the robots are able to discover other robots and their abilities during runtime. These abilities are implemented as services and described by their interfaces. Composition of services can be done easily and flexibly.

Modeling the context allows applications to better understand it and to adapt to its changes. In order to do this an appropriate formal representation method is needed. Ontologies have proven themselves to be one of the best tools to do it. Semantic inference provides a powerful framework to reason over the context data. But there are some problems with this approach. The inference over semantic context information can be cumbersome when working with a large amount of data. This situation has become more common in modern smart environments where there are a lot sensors and devices available. In order to tackle this problem we have developed a mechanism to distribute the context reasoning problem into smaller parts in order to reduce the inference time. In this paper we describe a distributed peer-to-peer agent architecture of context consumers and context providers. We explain how this inference sharing process works, partitioning the context information according to the interests of the agents, location and a certainty factor. We also discuss the system architecture, analyzing the negotiation process between the agents. Finally we compare the distributed reasoning with the centralized one, analyzing in which situations is more suitable each approach. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.",

A crucial element for the success of these systems is the exchange of information, not only between vehicles, but also among other components in the road infrastructure through different applications. One of the most important information sources in this kind of systems is sensors. Sensors can be within vehicles or as part of the infrastructure, such as bridges, roads or traffic signs. Sensors can provide information related to weather conditions and traffic situation, which is useful to improve the driving process. To facilitate the exchange of information between the different applications that use sensor data, a common framework of knowledge is needed to allow interoperability.

10.3390/s17081775,Sensors,"Monitoring mechanisms that ensure efficient crop growth are essential on many farms, especially in certain areas of the planet where water is scarce. Most farmers must assume the high cost of the required equipment in order to be able to streamline natural resources on their farms. Considering that many farmers cannot afford to install this equipment, it is necessary to look for more effective solutions that would be cheaper to implement. The objective of this study is to build virtual organizations of agents that can communicate between each other while monitoring crops. A low cost sensor architecture allows farmers to monitor and optimize the growth of their crops by streamlining the amount of resources the crops need at every moment. Since the hardware has limited processing and communication capabilities, our approach uses the PANGEA architecture to overcome this limitation. Specifically, we will design a system that is capable of collecting heterogeneous information from its environment, using sensors for temperature, solar radiation, humidity, pH, moisture and wind. A major outcome of our approach is that our solution is able to merge heterogeneous data from sensors and produce a response adapted to the context.

10.3390/s18030865,Sensors,"At present, the domotization of homes and public buildings is becoming increasingly popular. Domotization is most commonly applied to the field of energy management, since it gives the possibility of managing the consumption of the devices connected to the electric network, the way in which the users interact with these devices, as well as other external factors that influence consumption. In buildings, Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems have the highest consumption rates. The systems proposed so far have not succeeded in optimizing the energy consumption associated with a HVAC system because they do not monitor all the variables involved in electricity consumption. For this reason, this article presents an agent approach that benefits from the advantages provided by a Multi-Agent architecture (MAS) deployed in a Cloud environment with a wireless sensor network (WSN) in order to achieve energy savings. The agents of the MAS learn social behavior thanks to the collection of data and the use of an artificial neural network (ANN). The proposed system has been assessed in an office building achieving an average energy savings of 41% in the experimental group offices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/s19204410,Sensors,"Hyperconnectivity via modern Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has recently driven us to envision “digital twin”, in which physical attributes are all embedded, and their latest updates are synchronized on digital spaces in a timely fashion. From the point of view of cyberphysical system (CPS) architectures, the goals of digital twin include providing common programming abstraction on the same level of databases, thereby facilitating seamless integration of real-world physical objects and digital assets at several different system layers. However, the inherent limitations of sampling and observing physical attributes often pose issues related to data uncertainty in practice. In this paper, we propose a learning-based data management scheme where the implementation is layered between sensors attached to physical attributes and domain-specific applications, thereby mitigating the data uncertainty between them. To do so, we present a sensor data management framework, namely D2WIN, which adopts reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to manage the data quality for CPS applications and autonomous systems. To deal with the scale issue incurred by many physical attributes and sensor streams when adopting RL, we propose an action embedding strategy that exploits their distance-based similarity in the physical space coordination. We introduce two embedding methods, i.e., a user-defined function and a generative model, for different conditions. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the D2WIN framework with the action embedding outperforms several known heuristics in terms of achievable data quality under certain resource restrictions. We also test the framework with an autonomous driving simulator, clearly showing its benefit. For example, with only 30% of updates selectively applied by the learned policy, the driving agent maintains its performance about 96.2%, as compared to the ideal condition with full updates. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

These tasks generally require sampling waters at several hard to access points, be it real time with multiparametric sensor probes, or retrieving water samples. Full automation of these processes would require deploying hundreds (if not thousands) of fixed sensors, unless the sensors can be translated. This work proposes the utilization of robotized unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms to work as a virtual high density sensor network, which could analyze in real time or capture samples depending on the robotic UAV equipment. To check the validity of the concept, an instance of the robotized UAV platform has been fully designed and implemented. A multi-agent system approach has been used (implemented over a Robot Operating System, ROS, middleware layer) to define a software architecture able to deal with the different problems, optimizing modularity of the software; in terms of hardware, the UAV platform has been designed and built, as a sample capturing probe. A description on the main features of the multi-agent system proposed, its architecture, and the behavior of several components is discussed. The experimental validation and performance evaluation of the system components has been performed independently for the sake of safety: autonomous flight performance has been tested on-site; the accuracy of the localization technologies deemed as deployable options has been evaluated in controlled flights; and the viability of the sample capture device designed and built has been experimentally tested. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Thanks to the advances in wearable and portable sensing technologies, it is possible to provide patients with accurate monitoring devices, which simplifies the tracking of performance and effectiveness of physical exercises and treatments. Employing these approaches in everyday practice has enormous potential. Besides facilitating and improving the quality of care provided by physiotherapists, the usage of these technologies also promotes the personalization of treatments, thanks to data analytics and patient profiling (e.g., performance and behavior). However, achieving such goals implies tackling both technical and methodological challenges. In particular, (i) the capability of undertaking autonomous behaviors must comply with strict real-time constraints (e.g., scheduling, communication, and negotiation), (ii) plug-and-play sensors must seamlessly manage data and functional heterogeneity, and finally (iii) multi-device coordination must enable flexible and scalable sensor interactions. Beyond traditional top-down and best-effort solutions, unsuitable for safety-critical scenarios, we propose a novel approach for decentralized real-time compliant semantic agents. In particular, these agents can autonomously coordinate with each other, schedule sensing and data delivery tasks (complying with strict real-time constraints), while relying on ontology-based models to cope with data heterogeneity. Moreover, we present a model that represents sensors as autonomous agents able to schedule tasks and ensure interactions and negotiations compliant with strict timing constraints. Furthermore, to show the feasibility of the proposal, we present a practical study on upper and lower-limb digital rehabilitation scenarios, simulated on the MAXIM-GPRT environment for real-time compliance.

10.3390/s20051359,Sensors,"Reinforcement learning has recently been studied in various fields and also used to optimally control IoT devices supporting the expansion of Internet connection beyond the usual standard devices. In this paper, we try to allow multiple reinforcement learning agents to learn optimal control policy on their own IoT devices of the same type but with slightly different dynamics. For such multiple IoT devices, there is no guarantee that an agent who interacts only with one IoT device and learns the optimal control policy will also control another IoT device well. Therefore, we may need to apply independent reinforcement learning to each IoT device individually, which requires a costly or time-consuming effort. To solve this problem, we propose a new federated reinforcement learning architecture where each agent working on its independent IoT device shares their learning experience (i.e., the gradient of loss function) with each other, and transfers a mature policy model parameters into other agents. They accelerate its learning process by using mature parameters. We incorporate the actor–critic proximal policy optimization (Actor–Critic PPO) algorithm into each agent in the proposed collaborative architecture and propose an efficient procedure for the gradient sharing and the model transfer. Using multiple rotary inverted pendulum devices interconnected via a network switch, we demonstrate that the proposed federated reinforcement learning scheme can effectively facilitate the learning process for multiple IoT devices and that the learning speed can be faster if more agents are involved. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

The sizes of these structures and the necessary level of detail in each mission requires a conflicting set of multi-objective goals, such as performance, quality, and safety. It is challenging for human operators, or simple autonomous path-following drones, to process all this information, and thus, it is common that a mission must be repeated several times until it succeeds. This paper deals with this problem by developing a new cognitive architecture based on a collaborative environment between the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other agents focusing on optimizing the data gathering, information processing, and decision-making. The proposed architecture breaks the problem into independent units ranging from sensors and actuators up to high-level intelligence processes. It organizes the structures into data and information; each agent may request an individual behavior from the system. To deal with conflicting behaviors, a supervisory agent analyzes all requests and defines the final planning. This architecture enables real-time decision-making with intelligent social behavior among the agents. Thus, it is possible to process and make decisions about the best way to accomplish the mission.

10.3390/s20195577,Sensors,"Intelligent agents that can interact with users using natural language are becoming increasingly common. Sometimes an intelligent agent may not correctly understand a user command or may not perform it properly. In such cases, the user might try a second time by giving the agent another, slightly different command. Giving an agent the ability to detect such user corrections might help it fix its own mistakes and avoid making them in the future. In this work, we consider the problem of automatically detecting user corrections using deep learning. We develop a multimodal architecture called SAIF, which detects such user corrections, taking as inputs the user’s voice commands as well as their transcripts. Voice inputs allow SAIF to take advantage of sound cues, such as tone, speed, and word emphasis. In addition to sound cues, our model uses transcripts to determine whether a command is a correction to the previous command. Our model also obtains internal input from the agent, indicating whether the previous command was executed successfully or not. Finally, we release a unique dataset in which users interacted with an intelligent agent assistant, by giving it commands. This dataset includes labels on pairs of consecutive commands, which indicate whether the latter command is in fact a correction of the former command. We show that SAIF outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on this dataset. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Currently, these systems are usually tested by performing real scenarios that are costly, limited, hardly scalable, and poorly repeatable. As a solution, in this paper we propose an agent-based simulation platform, implemented through a micro service architecture, which may simulate UTM information sources, such as flight plans, telemetry messages, or tracks from a surveillance network. The final objective of this simulator is to use these information streams to perform a system-level evaluation of UTM systems both in the pre-flight and in-flight stages. The proposed platform, with a focus on simulation of communications and sensors, allows to model UTM actors’ behaviors and their interactions. In addition, it also considers the manual definition of events to simulate unexpected behaviors/events (contingencies), such as communications failures or pilots’ actions. In order to validate our architecture, we implemented a simulator that considers the following actors: drones, pilots, ground control stations, surveillance networks, and communications networks. This platform enables the simulation of the drone trajectory and control, the C2 (command and control) link, drone detection by surveillance sensors, and the communication of all agents by means of a mobile communications network.

A system architecture for solving dynamic PFSP using DRL is proposed, and the mathematical model to minimize total tardiness cost is established. Additionally, the intelligent scheduling system based on DRL is modeled, with state features, actions, and reward designed. Moreover, the advantage actor-critic (A2C) algorithm is adapted to train the scheduling agent. The learning curve indicates that the scheduling agent learned to generate better solutions efficiently during training. Extensive experiments are carried out to compare the A2C-based scheduling agent with every single action, other DRL algorithms, and meta-heuristics. The results show the well performance of the A2C-based scheduling agent considering solution quality, CPU times, and generalization.

DRL-based traffic signal control frameworks belong to either discrete or continuous controls. In discrete control, the DRL agent selects the appropriate traffic light phase from a finite set of phases. Whereas in continuous control approach, the agent decides the appropriate duration for each signal phase within a predetermined sequence of phases. Among the existing works, there are no prior approaches that propose a flexible framework combining both discrete and continuous DRL approaches in controlling traffic signal. Thus, our ultimate objective in this paper is to propose an approach capable of deciding simultaneously the proper phase and its associated duration. Our contribution resides in adapting a hybrid Deep Reinforcement Learning that considers at the same time discrete and continuous decisions. Precisely, we customize a Parameterized Deep Q-Networks (P-DQN) architecture that permits a hierarchical decision-making process that primarily decides the traffic light next phases and secondly specifies its the associated timing.

10.3390/s22051746,Sensors,"Future network services must adapt to the highly dynamic uplink and downlink traffic. To fulfill this requirement, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) proposed dynamic time division duplex (D-TDD) technology in Long Term Evolution (LTE) Release 11. Afterward, the 3GPP RAN#86 meeting clarified that 5G NR needs to support dynamic adjustment of the duplex pattern (transmission direction) in the time domain. Although 5G NR provides a more flexible duplex pattern, how to configure an effective duplex pattern according to services traffic is still an open research area. In this research, we propose a distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) based decentralized D-TDD configuration method. First, we model a D-TDD configuration problem as a dynamic programming problem. Given the buffer length of all UE, we model the D-TDD configuration policy as a conditional probability distribution. Our goal is to find a D-TDD configuration policy that maximizes the expected discount return of all UE’s sum rates. Second, in order to reduce signaling overhead, we design a fully decentralized solution with distributed MARL technology. Each agent in MARL makes decisions only based on local observations. We regard each base station (BS) as an agent, and each agent configures uplink and downlink time slot ratio according to length of intra-BS user (UE) queue buffer. Third, in order to solve the problem of overall system revenue caused by the lack of global information in MARL, we apply leniency control and binary LSTM (BLSTM) based auto-encoder. Leniency controller effectively controls Q-value estimation process in MARL according to Q-value and current network conditions, and auto-encoder makes up for the defect that leniency control cannot handle complex environments and high-dimensional data. Through the parallel distributed training, the global D-TDD policy is obtained. This method deploys the MARL algorithm on the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) server of each BS and uses the storage and computing capabilities of the server for distributed training. The simulation results show that the proposed distributed MARL converges stably in various environments, and performs better than distributed deep reinforcement algorithm. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Therefore, it is challenging to choose a proper location for executing network functions (NFs) over these entities by considering propagation delay and computational capacity. In this paper, we propose a Soft Actor– Critic Energy-Aware Dynamic DU Selection algorithm (SA2C-EADDUS) by integrating two nested actor–critic agents in the O-RAN architecture.

In our view, Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) with MATL can play an essential role in the orchestration of O-RAN controllers, i.e., near-real-time and non-real-time RAN Intelligent Controllers (RIC). In this article, we first provide an overview of the landscape in RAN disaggregation, virtualization and O-RAN, then we present the state-of-the-art research in multi-agent systems and team learning as well as their application to O-RAN. We present a case study for team learning where agents are two distinct xApps: power allocation and radio resource allocation. We demonstrate how team learning can enhance network performance when team learning is used instead of individual learning agents. Finally, we identify challenges and open issues to provide a roadmap for researchers in the area of MATL based O-RAN optimization. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/s22155490,Sensors,"The underwater wireless sensor network is an important component of the underwater three-dimensional monitoring system. Due to the high bit error rate, high delay, low bandwidth, limited energy, and high dynamic of underwater networks, it is very difficult to realize efficient and reliable data transmission. Therefore, this paper posits that it is not enough to design the routing algorithm only from the perspective of the transmission environment; the comprehensive design of the data transmission algorithm should also be combined with the application. An edge prediction-based adaptive data transmission algorithm (EP-ADTA) is proposed that can dynamically adapt to the needs of underwater monitoring applications and the changes in the transmission environment. EP-ADTA uses the end–edge–cloud architecture to define the underwater wireless sensor networks. The algorithm uses communication nodes as the agents, realizes the monitoring data prediction and compression according to the edge prediction, dynamically selects the transmission route, and controls the data transmission accuracy based on reinforcement learning. The simulation results show that EP-ADTA can meet the accuracy requirements of underwater monitoring applications, dynamically adapt to the changes in the transmission environment, and ensure efficient and reliable data transmission in underwater wireless sensor networks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/s22186842,Sensors,"Internet of Things (IoT) systems are complex systems that can manage mission-critical, costly operations or the collection, storage, and processing of sensitive data. Therefore, security represents a primary concern that should be considered when engineering IoT systems. Additionally, several challenges need to be addressed, including the following ones. IoT systems’ environments are dynamic and uncertain. For instance, IoT devices can be mobile or might run out of batteries, so they can become suddenly unavailable. To cope with such environments, IoT systems can be engineered as goal-driven and self-adaptive systems. A goal-driven IoT system is composed of a dynamic set of IoT devices and services that temporarily connect and cooperate to achieve a specific goal. Several approaches have been proposed to engineer goal-driven and self-adaptive IoT systems. However, none of the existing approaches enable goal-driven IoT systems to automatically detect security threats and autonomously adapt to mitigate them. Toward bridging these gaps, this paper proposes a distributed architectural Approach for engineering goal-driven IoT Systems that can autonomously SElf-adapt to secuRity Threats in their environments (ASSERT). ASSERT exploits techniques and adopts notions, such as agents, federated learning, feedback loops, and blockchain, for maintaining the systems’ security and enhancing the trustworthiness of the adaptations they perform. The results of the experiments that we conducted to validate the approach’s feasibility show that it performs and scales well when detecting security threats, performing autonomous security adaptations to mitigate the threats and enabling systems’ constituents to learn about security threats in their environments collaboratively. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/s22249915,Sensors,"The accelerating transition of traditional industrial processes towards fully automated and intelligent manufacturing is being witnessed in almost all segments. This major adoption of enhanced technology and digitization processes has been originally embraced by the Factories of the Future and Industry 4.0 initiatives. The overall aim is to create smarter, more sustainable, and more resilient future-oriented factories. Unsurprisingly, introducing new production paradigms based on technologies such as machine learning (ML), the Internet of Things (IoT), and robotics does not come at no cost as each newly incorporated technique poses various safety and security challenges. Similarly, the integration required between these techniques to establish a unified and fully interconnected environment contributes to additional threats and risks in the Factories of the Future. Accumulating and analyzing seemingly unrelated activities, occurring simultaneously in different parts of the factory, is essential to establish cyber situational awareness of the investigated environment. Our work contributes to these efforts, in essence by envisioning and implementing the SMS-DT, an integrated platform to simulate and monitor industrial conditions in a digital twin-based architecture. SMS-DT is represented in a three-tier architecture comprising the involved data and control flows: edge, platform, and enterprise tiers. The goal of our platform is to capture, analyze, and correlate a wide range of events being tracked by sensors and systems in various domains of the factory. For this aim, multiple components have been developed on the basis of artificial intelligence to simulate dominant aspects in industries, including network analysis, energy optimization, and worker behavior. A data lake was also used to store collected information, and a set of intelligent services was delivered on the basis of innovative analysis and learning approaches. Finally, the platform was tested in a textile industry environment and integrated with its ERP system. Two misuse cases were simulated to track the factory machines, systems, and people and to assess the role of SMS-DT correlation mechanisms in preventing intentional and unintentional actions. The results of these misuse case simulations showed how the SMS-DT platform can intervene in two domains in the first scenario and three in the second one, resulting in correlating the alerts and reporting them to security operators in the multi-domain intelligent correlation dashboard. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/s23010021,Sensors,"Knowledge-based synergistic automation is a potential intermediate option between the opposite extremes of manual and fully automated robotic labor in agriculture. Disruptive information and communication technologies (ICT) and sophisticated solutions for human-robot interaction (HRI) endow a skilled farmer with enhanced capabilities to perform agricultural tasks more efficiently and productively. This research aspires to apply systems engineering principles to assess the design of a conceptual human-robot synergistic platform enabled by a sensor-driven ICT sub-system. In particular, this paper firstly presents an overview of a use case, including a human-robot synergistic platform comprising a drone, a mobile platform, and wearable equipment. The technology framework constitutes a paradigm of human-centric worker-robot logistics synergy for high-value crops, which is applicable in operational environments of outdoor in-field harvesting and handling operations. Except for the physical sub-system, the ICT sub-system of the robotic framework consists of an extended sensor network for enabling data acquisition to extract the context (e.g., worker’s status, environment awareness) and plan and schedule the robotic agents of the framework. Secondly, this research explicitly presents the underpinning Design Structure Matrix (DSM) that systematically captures the interrelations between the sensors in the platform and data/information signals for enabling synergistic operations. The employed Systems Engineering approach provides a comprehensible analysis of the baseline structure existing in the examined human–robot synergy platform. In particular, the applied DSM allows for understanding and synthesizing a sensor sub-system’s architecture and enriching its efficacy by informing targeted interventions and reconfiguring the developed robotic solution modules depending on the required farming tasks at an orchard. Human-centric solutions for the agrarian sector demand careful study of the features that the particular agri-field possesses; thus, the insight DSM provides to system designers can turn out to be useful in the investigation of other similar data-driven applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/s23031513,Sensors,"In this study, we develop a framework for an intelligent and self-supervised industrial pick-and-place operation for cluttered environments. Our target is to have the agent learn to perform prehensile and non-prehensile robotic manipulations to improve the efficiency and throughput of the pick-and-place task. To achieve this target, we specify the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and deploy a deep reinforcement learning (RL) temporal difference model-free algorithm known as the deep Q-network (DQN). We consider three actions in our MDP; one is ‘grasping’ from the prehensile manipulation category and the other two are ‘left-slide’ and ‘right-slide’ from the non-prehensile manipulation category. Our DQN is composed of three fully convolutional networks (FCN) based on the memory-efficient architecture of DenseNet-121 which are trained together without causing any bottleneck situations. Each FCN corresponds to each discrete action and outputs a pixel-wise map of affordances for the relevant action. Rewards are allocated after every forward pass and backpropagation is carried out for weight tuning in the corresponding FCN. In this manner, non-prehensile manipulations are learnt which can, in turn, lead to possible successful prehensile manipulations in the near future and vice versa, thus increasing the efficiency and throughput of the pick-and-place task. The Results section shows performance comparisons of our approach to a baseline deep learning approach and a ResNet architecture-based approach, along with very promising test results at varying clutter densities across a range of complex scenario test cases. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/s23104946,Sensors,"Reinforcement learning agents that have not been seen during training must be robust in test environments. However, the generalization problem is challenging to solve in reinforcement learning using high-dimensional images as the input. The addition of a self-supervised learning framework with data augmentation in the reinforcement learning architecture can promote generalization to a certain extent. However, excessively large changes in the input images may disturb reinforcement learning. Therefore, we propose a contrastive learning method that can help manage the trade-off relationship between the performance of reinforcement learning and auxiliary tasks against the data augmentation strength. In this framework, strong augmentation does not disturb reinforcement learning and instead maximizes the auxiliary effect for generalization. Results of experiments on the DeepMind Control suite demonstrate that the proposed method effectively uses strong data augmentation and achieves a higher generalization than the existing methods. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

Then, it proposes a hybrid AI system, integrating deep reinforcement learning in a multi-agent centralized swarm architecture. The proposed system is tailored to perform surveillance of a specific area, searching and tracking ground targets, for security and law enforcement applications. The swarm is governed by a central swarm controller responsible for distributing different search and tracking tasks among the cooperating UAVs. Each UAV agent is then controlled by a collection of cooperative sub-agents, whose behaviors have been trained using different deep reinforcement learning models, tailored for the different task types proposed by the swarm controller. More specifically, proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithms were used to train the agents' behavior. In addition, several metrics to assess the performance of the swarm in this application were defined. The results obtained through simulation show that our system searches the operation area effectively, acquires the targets in a reasonable time, and is capable of tracking them continuously and consistently.

The employed robotic cognitive architecture, named CORTEX, leverages a highly efficient distributed working memory known as deep state representation. This working memory inherently encompasses a fundamental ontology, state persistency, geometric and logical relationships among elements, and tools for reading, updating, and reasoning about its contents. Our primary objective is to investigate the hypothesis that the integration of a physics simulator into the architecture streamlines the implementation of various functionalities that would otherwise necessitate extensive coding and debugging efforts. Furthermore, we categorize these enhanced functionalities into broad types based on the nature of the problems they address. These include addressing challenges related to occlusion, model-based perception, self-calibration, scene structural stability, and human activity interpretation. To demonstrate the outcomes of our experiments, we employ CoppeliaSim as the embedded simulator and both a Kinova Gen3 robotic arm and the Open-Manipulator-P as the real-world scenarios. Synchronization is maintained between the simulator and the stream of real events. Depending on the ongoing task, numerous queries are computed, and the results are projected into the working memory.

10.3390/s24092921,Sensors,"Interoperability is a central problem in digitization and System of Systems (SoS) engineering, which concerns the capacity of systems to exchange information and cooperate. The task to dynamically establish interoperability between heterogeneous cyber-physical systems (CPSs) at run-time is a challenging problem. Different aspects of the interoperability problem have been studied in fields such as SoS, neural translation, and agent-based systems, but there are no unifying solutions beyond domain-specific standardization efforts. The problem is complicated by the uncertain and variable relations between physical processes and human-centric symbols, which result from, e.g., latent physical degrees of freedom, maintenance, re-configurations, and software updates. Therefore, we surveyed the literature for concepts and methods needed to automatically establish SoSs with purposeful CPS communication, focusing on machine learning and connecting approaches that are not integrated in the present literature. Here, we summarize recent developments relevant to the dynamic interoperability problem, such as representation learning for ontology alignment and inference on heterogeneous linked data; neural networks for transcoding of text and code; concept learning-based reasoning; and emergent communication. We find that there has been a recent interest in deep learning approaches to establishing communication under different assumptions about the environment, language, and nature of the communicating entities. Furthermore, we present examples of architectures and discuss open problems associated with artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled solutions in relation to SoS interoperability requirements. Although these developments open new avenues for research, there are still no examples that bridge the concepts necessary to establish dynamic interoperability in complex SoSs, and realistic testbeds are needed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/s24196202,Sensors,"Urban traffic congestion poses significant economic and environmental challenges worldwide. To mitigate these issues, Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) has emerged as a promising solution. Recent advancements in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have further enhanced ATSC’s capabilities. This paper introduces a novel DRL-based ATSC approach named the Sequence Decision Transformer (SDT), employing DRL enhanced with attention mechanisms and leveraging the robust capabilities of sequence decision models, akin to those used in advanced natural language processing, adapted here to tackle the complexities of urban traffic management. Firstly, the ATSC problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), with the observation space, action space, and reward function carefully defined. Subsequently, we propose SDT, specifically tailored to solve the MDP problem. The SDT model uses a transformer-based architecture with an encoder and decoder in an actor–critic structure. The encoder processes observations and outputs, both encoded data for the decoder, and value estimates for parameter updates. The decoder, as the policy network, outputs the agent’s actions. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is used to update the policy network based on historical data, enhancing decision-making in ATSC. This approach significantly reduces training times, effectively manages larger observation spaces, captures dynamic changes in traffic conditions more accurately, and enhances traffic throughput. Finally, the SDT model is trained and evaluated in synthetic scenarios by comparing the number of vehicles, average speed, and queue length against three baselines, including PPO, a DQN tailored for ATSC, and FRAP, a state-of-the-art ATSC algorithm. SDT shows improvements of 26.8%, 150%, and 21.7% over traditional ATSC algorithms, and 18%, 30%, and 15.6% over the FRAP.

10.3390/s24206723,Sensors,"Autonomous navigation systems often struggle in dynamic, complex environments due to challenges in safety, intent prediction, and strategic planning. Traditional methods are limited by rigid architectures and inadequate safety mechanisms, reducing adaptability to unpredictable scenarios. We propose SafeMod, a novel framework enhancing safety in autonomous driving by improving decision-making and scenario management. SafeMod features a bidirectional planning structure with two components: forward planning and backward planning. Forward planning predicts surrounding agents’ behavior using text-based environment descriptions and reasoning via large language models, generating action predictions. These are embedded into a transformer-based planner that integrates text and image data to produce feasible driving trajectories. Backward planning refines these trajectories using policy and value functions learned through Actor–Critic-based reinforcement learning, selecting optimal actions based on probability distributions. Experiments on CARLA and nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that SafeMod outperforms recent planning systems in both real-world and simulation testing, significantly improving safety and decision-making.

10.3390/s25154666,Sensors,"This paper proposes a low-latency and scalable architecture for Edge-Enabled Digital Twin networked control systems (E-DTNCS) aimed at multi-robot collision avoidance and remote control in dynamic and latency-sensitive environments. Traditional approaches, which rely on centralized cloud processing or direct sensor-to-controller communication, are inherently limited by excessive network latency, bandwidth bottlenecks, and a lack of predictive decision-making, thus constraining their effectiveness in real-time multi-agent systems. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that seamlessly integrates edge computing with digital twin (DT) technology. By performing localized preprocessing at the edge, the system extracts semantically rich features from raw sensor data streams, reducing the transmission overhead of the original data. This shift from raw data to feature-based communication significantly alleviates network congestion and enhances system responsiveness. The DT layer leverages these extracted features to maintain high-fidelity synchronization with physical robots and to execute predictive models for proactive collision avoidance. To empirically validate the framework, a real-world testbed was developed, and extensive experiments were conducted with multiple mobile robots. The results revealed a substantial reduction in collision rates when DT was deployed, and further improvements were observed with E-DTNCS integration due to significantly reduced latency. These findings confirm the system’s enhanced responsiveness and its effectiveness in handling real-time control tasks. The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of combining edge intelligence with DT-driven control in advancing the reliability, scalability, and real-time performance of multi-robot systems for industrial automation and mission-critical cyber-physical applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/s25175265,Sensors,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is now the computational core of smart building automation, acting across the entire cyber–physical stack. This review surveys peer-reviewed work on the integration of AI with indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and energy performance, distinguishing itself by presenting a holistic synthesis of the complete technological evolution from IoT sensors to generative AI. We uniquely frame this progression within a human-centric architecture that integrates digital twins of both the building (DT-B) and its occupants (DT-H), providing a forward-looking perspective on occupant comfort and energy management. We find that deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents, often developed within physics-calibrated digital twins, reduce annual HVAC demand by 10–35% while maintaining an operative temperature within ±0.5 °C and CO<inf>2</inf> below 800 ppm. These comfort and IAQ targets are consistent with ASHRAE Standard 55 (thermal environmental conditions) and ASHRAE Standard 62.1 (ventilation for acceptable indoor air quality); keeping the operative temperature within ±0.5 °C of the setpoint and indoor CO<inf>2</inf> near or below ~800 ppm reflects commonly adopted control tolerances and per-person outdoor air supply objectives. Regarding energy impacts, simulation studies commonly report higher double-digit reductions, whereas real building deployments typically achieve single- to low-double-digit savings; we therefore report simulation and field results separately. Supervised learners, including gradient boosting and various neural networks, achieve 87–97% accuracy for short-term load, comfort, and fault forecasting. Furthermore, unsupervised models successfully mine large-scale telemetry for anomalies and occupancy patterns, enabling adaptive ventilation that can cut sick building complaints by 40%. Despite these gains, deployment is hindered by fragmented datasets, interoperability issues between legacy BAS and modern IoT devices, and the computer energy and privacy–security costs of large models. The key research priorities include (1) open, high-fidelity IEQ benchmarks; (2) energy-aware, on-device learning architectures; (3) privacy-preserving federated frameworks; (4) hybrid, physics-informed models to win operator trust.

This review examines CVD diagnostics using innovative technologies such as digital cardiovascular twins, which involve the collection of data from wearable IoT devices (electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), and mechanocardiography), clinical records, laboratory biomarkers, and genetic markers, as well as their integration with artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning and deep learning, graph and transformer networks for interpreting multi-dimensional data streams and creating prognostic models, as well as generative AI, medical large language models (LLMs), and autonomous agents for decision support, personalized alerts, and treatment scenario modeling, and with cloud and edge computing for data processing. This multi-layered architecture enables the detection of silent pathologies long before clinical manifestations, transforming continuous observations into actionable recommendations and shifting cardiology from reactive treatment to predictive and preventive care. Evidence converges on four layers: sensors streaming multimodal clinical and environmental data; hybrid analytics that integrate hemodynamic models with deep-, graph- and transformer learning while Bayesian and Kalman filters manage uncertainty; decision support delivered by domain-tuned medical LLMs and autonomous agents; and prospective simulations that trial pacing or pharmacotherapy before bedside use, closing the prediction-intervention loop.

Both approaches were evaluated on key metrics such as planning time, success rate, and trajectory smoothness. Results show that the DRL-based planner achieves higher success rates and significantly lower planning times, producing more compact and deterministic trajectories. Time-optimal parameterization using TOPPRA ensured the dynamic feasibility of all trajectories.

This research introduces a dynamic path planning system for AMRs designed for reactive adaptation to FMS disturbances and generalisation across factory layouts, incorporating support for multiple AMRs with integrated conflict avoidance. The system is built on a Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) architecture, where software AMR agents independently calculate their paths using a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) that employs Cell-Based Decomposition (CBD) and optimises path length, smoothness, and overlap via a multi-objective fitness function. Multi-AMR conflict avoidance is implemented using the Iterative Exclusion Principle (IEP), which facilitates priority-based planning, knowledge sharing through Predictive Collision Avoidance (PCA), and iterative replanning among agents communicating via a blackboard agent. Verification demonstrated the system’s ability to successfully avoid deadlocks for up to nine AMRs and exhibit good scalability. Validation in a simulated FMS environment confirmed robust adaptation to various disturbances, including static and dynamic obstacles, while maintaining stable run times and consistent path quality.

According to the architecture, an energy based acoustic localization algorithm is proposed. In localization, estimate of target location is obtained by steepest descent search. The search algorithm adapts to measurement environments by dynamically adjusting its termination condition. With the agent architecture, target classification is accomplished by distributed support vector machine (SVM). Mobile agents are employed for feature extraction and distributed SVM learning to reduce communication load. Desirable learning performance is guaranteed by combining support vectors and convex hull vectors. Fusion algorithms are designed to merge SVM classification decisions made from various modalities.

10.3390/smartcities8010019,Smart Cities,"Highlights: What are the main findings? For smart city management, LLM-based multi-agent systems achieve 94–99% accuracy in routing urban queries and demonstrate significant improvements in response quality (G-Eval scores of 0.68–0.74) compared to standalone LLMs (0.30–0.38). Achievement of high scores in routing queries and response accuracy is possible with middle-size LLM models rather than the biggest LLM models. What is the implication of the main findings? The multi-agent LLM approach enables efficient processing of complex urban planning tasks while maintaining high relevance in responses, making it practical for real-world city management applications. LLM agents can effectively augment human decision making in urban planning by reducing task completion time from days to hours while maintaining accuracy and accountability in complex scenarios. This study investigates the implementation of LLM agents in smart city management, leveraging both the inherent language processing abilities of LLMs and the distributed problem solving capabilities of multi-agent systems for the improvement of urban decision making processes. A multi-agent system architecture combines LLMs with existing urban information systems to process complex queries and generate contextually relevant responses for urban planning and management. The research is focused on three main hypotheses testing: (1) LLM agents’ capability for effective routing and processing diverse urban queries, (2) the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology in improving response accuracy when working with local knowledge and regulations, and (3) the impact of integrating LLM agents with existing urban information systems. Our experimental results, based on a comprehensive validation dataset of 150 question–answer pairs, demonstrate significant improvements in decision support capabilities. The multi-agent system achieved pipeline selection accuracy of 94–99% across different models, while the integration of RAG technology improved response accuracy by 17% for strategic development queries and 55% for service accessibility questions. The combined use of document databases and service APIs resulted in the highest performance metrics (G-Eval scores of 0.68–0.74) compared to standalone LLM responses (0.30–0.38). Using St. Petersburg’s Digital Urban Platform as a testbed, we demonstrate the practical applicability of this approach to create integrated city management systems with support complex urban decision making processes. This research contributes to the growing field of AI-enhanced urban management by providing empirical evidence of LLM agents’ effectiveness in processing heterogeneous urban data and supporting strategic planning decisions.

10.3390/su132011390,Sustainability (Switzerland),"Current architectures for social agents are designed around some specific units of social behavior that address particular challenges, such as modeling beliefs and motivations, establishing social relationships, or understanding group memberships. Although their performance might be adequate for controlled environments, deploying these agents in the wild is difficult. Moreover, the increasing demand for autonomous agents capable of living alongside humans calls for the design of more robust social agents that can cope with diverse social situations. We believe that to design such agents, their sociality and cognition should be conceived as one. This includes creating mechanisms for constructing social reality as an interpretation of the physical world with social meanings and selective deployment of cognitive resources adequate to the situation. We identify several design principles that should be considered while designing agent architectures for socio-cognitive systems. Taking these remarks into account, we propose a socio-cognitive agent model based on the concept of cognitive social frames that allow the adaptation of an agent’s cognition based on its interpretation of its surroundings, its social context. Our approach supports an agent’s reasoning about other social actors and its relationship with them. Cognitive social frames can be built around social groups, and form the basis for social group dynamics mechanisms and construct of social identity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/su152316291,Sustainability (Switzerland),"Artificial intelligence (AI) is an umbrella term that encompasses different fields of study, and topics related to these fields are addressed separately or within the scope of AI. Multi-agent systems (MASs) and machine learning (ML) are the core concepts of AI that are taught during AI courses. The separate explanation of these core research areas is common, but the emergence of federated learning has triggered their combined usage. This paper describes a practical scenario in the energy domain where these technologies can be used together to provide a sustainable energy solution for predicting wind turbine active power production. The projects in the AI course were assigned prior to the step-by-step learning of MASs and ML. These concepts were applied using a wind turbine energy dataset collected in Turkey to predict the power production of wind turbines. The observed performance improvements, achieved by applying various agent architectures and data partitioning scenarios, indicate that boosting methods such as LightGBM yield better results even when the settings are modified. Additionally, a questionnaire about the assignments was filled out by the student groups to assess the impact of learning MASs and ML through project-based education. The application of MASs and ML in a hybrid way proves valuable for learning core concepts related to AI education, as evidenced by feedback from students. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/su16051779,Sustainability (Switzerland),"As urban centers evolve into smart cities, sustainable mobility emerges as a cornerstone for ensuring environmental integrity and enhancing quality of life. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) play a pivotal role in this transformation, with the potential to significantly improve efficiency and safety, and reduce environmental impacts. This study introduces a novel Multi-Agent Actor–Critic (MA2C) algorithm tailored for multi-AV lane-changing in mixed-traffic scenarios, a critical component of intelligent transportation systems in smart cities. By incorporating a local reward system that values efficiency, safety, and passenger comfort, and a parameter-sharing scheme that encourages inter-agent collaboration, our MA2C algorithm presents a comprehensive approach to urban traffic management. The MA2C algorithm leverages reinforcement learning to optimize lane-changing decisions, ensuring optimal traffic flow and enhancing both environmental sustainability and urban living standards. The actor–critic architecture is refined to minimize variances in urban traffic conditions, enhancing predictability and safety. The study extends to simulating realistic human-driven vehicle (HDV) behavior using the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) and the model of Minimizing Overall Braking Induced by Lane changes (MOBIL), contributing to more accurate and effective traffic management strategies. Empirical results indicate that the MA2C algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in managing lane changes, passenger comfort, and inter-vehicle cooperation, essential for the dynamic environment of smart cities. The success of the MA2C algorithm in facilitating seamless interaction between AVs and HDVs holds promise for more fluid urban traffic conditions, reduced congestion, and lower emissions. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on autonomous driving within the framework of sustainable smart cities, focusing on the integration of AVs into the urban fabric. It underscores the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence in developing transportation systems that are not only efficient and safe but also sustainable, supporting the broader goals of creating resilient, adaptive, and environmentally friendly urban spaces. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

A distributed multi-agent scheduling architecture (DMASA) is constructed to maximize global rewards, modeling the intelligent manufacturing job shop scheduling problem as a sequential decision problem represented by graphs and using a Graph Embedding–Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GE-HetGNN) to encode state nodes and map them to the optimal scheduling strategy, including machine matching and process selection strategies. Finally, an actor–critic architecture-based multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm is employed to train the network and optimize the decision-making process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework exhibits generalizability, outperforms commonly used scheduling rules and RL-based scheduling methods on benchmarks, shows better stability than single-agent scheduling architectures, and breaks through the instance-size constraint, making it suitable for large-scale problems. We verified the feasibility of our proposed method in a specific experimental environment.

A novel framework is proposed, combining Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) with a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller, specifically applied to the ABB IRB120, a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) industrial manipulator, for pick-and-place tasks in warehouse automation. The methodology employs an actor–critic RL architecture with a 27-dimensional state input and a 6-dimensional joint action output. The RL agent was trained using MATLAB’s Reinforcement Learning Toolbox and integrated with ABB’s RobotStudio simulation environment via TCP/IP communication. LQR controllers were incorporated to optimize joint-space trajectory tracking, minimizing energy consumption while ensuring precise control. The novelty of this research lies in its synergistic combination of RL and LQR control, addressing energy efficiency and precision simultaneously—an area that has seen limited exploration in industrial robotics. Experimental validation across 100 diverse scenarios confirmed the framework’s effectiveness, achieving a mean positioning accuracy of 2.14 mm (a 28% improvement over traditional methods), a 92.5% success rate in pick-and-place tasks, and a 22.7% reduction in energy consumption. The system demonstrated stable convergence after 458 episodes and maintained a mean joint angle error of 4.30°, validating its robustness and efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of RL for broader industrial applications. The demonstrated accuracy and success rate suggest its applicability to complex tasks such as electronic component assembly, multi-step manufacturing, delicate material handling, precision coordination, and quality inspection tasks like automated visual inspection, surface defect detection, and dimensional verification. Successful implementation in such contexts requires addressing challenges including task complexity, computational efficiency, and adaptability to process variability, alongside ensuring safety, reliability, and seamless system integration.

10.3390/su17177826,Sustainability (Switzerland),"To improve the traffic efficiency of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in on-ramp merging areas, this study proposes a novel region-level multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, Regionally Coordinated Nash-Advantage Decomposition Deep Q-Network with Conflict-Aware Q Fusion (RC-NashAD-DQN). Unlike existing vehicle-level control methods, which suffer from high computational overhead and poor scalability, our approach abstracts on-ramp and main road areas as region-level control agents, achieving coordinated yet independent decision-making while maintaining control precision and merging efficiency comparable to fine-grained vehicle-level approaches. Each agent adopts a value–advantage decomposition architecture to enhance policy stability and distinguish action values, while sharing state–action information to improve inter-agent awareness. A Nash equilibrium solver is applied to derive joint strategies, and a conflict-aware Q-fusion mechanism is introduced as a regularization term rather than a direct action-selection tool, enabling the system to resolve local conflicts—particularly at region boundaries—without compromising global coordination. This design reduces training complexity, accelerates convergence, and improves robustness against communication imperfections. The framework is evaluated using the SUMO simulator at the Taishan Road interchange on the S1 Yongtaiwen Expressway under heterogeneous traffic conditions involving both passenger cars and container trucks, and is compared with baseline models including C-DRL-VSL and MADDPG. Extensive simulations demonstrate that RC-NashAD-DQN significantly improves average traffic speed by 17.07% and reduces average delay by 12.68 s, outperforming all baselines in efficiency metrics while maintaining robust convergence performance. These improvements enhance cooperation and merging efficiency among vehicles, contributing to sustainable urban mobility and the advancement of intelligent transportation systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.3390/sym16111537,Symmetry,"Coverage Path Planning (CPP) in unknown environments presents unique challenges that often require the system to maintain a symmetry between exploration and exploitation in order to efficiently cover unknown areas. This paper introduces latent imagination-based reinforcement learning (LIRL), a novel framework that addresses these challenges by integrating three key components: memory-augmented experience replay (MAER), a latent imagination module (LIM), and multi-step prediction learning (MSPL) within a soft actor–critic architecture. MAER enhances sample efficiency by prioritizing experience retrieval, LIM facilitates long-term planning via simulated trajectories, and MSPL optimizes the trade-off between immediate rewards and future outcomes through adaptive n-step learning. MAER, LIM, and MSPL work within a soft actor–critic architecture, and LIRL creates a dynamic equilibrium that enables efficient, adaptive decision-making. We evaluate LIRL across diverse simulated environments, demonstrating substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Through this method, the agent optimally balances short-term actions with long-term planning, maintaining symmetrical responses to varying environmental changes. The results highlight LIRL’s potential for advancing autonomous CPP in real-world applications such as search and rescue, agricultural robotics, and warehouse automation.

There are numerous methods for this vital model-building stage, ranging from domain-specific manual tuning guidelines suggested by the oracles to the utilization of general purpose black-box optimization techniques. This paper proposes an agent-based collaborative technique for finding near-optimal values for any arbitrary set of hyperparameters (or decision variables) in a machine learning model (or a black-box function optimization problem). The developed method forms a hierarchical agent-based architecture for the distribution of the searching operations at different dimensions and employs a cooperative searching procedure based on an adaptive width-based random sampling technique to locate the optima. The behavior of the presented model, specifically against changes in its design parameters, is investigated in both machine learning and global function optimization applications, and its performance is compared with that of two randomized tuning strategies that are commonly used in practice. Moreover, we have compared the performance of the proposed approach against particle swarm optimization (PSO) and simulated annealing (SA) methods in function optimization to provide additional insights into its exploration in the search space.

10.3844/jcssp.2010.557.565,Journal of Computer Science,"Problem statement: It has been proven that Believe, Desire, Intention (BDI) agent architecture, performs suitably in dynamic and unpredictable environments. Although BDI architecture has been formulated rigorously, implementing BDI architecture is not as straightforward as it has been promised. Nevertheless, the preeminent implementation of BDI architecture is Procedural Reasoning System (PRS) and Jadex is a Java-based platform that successfully applies PRS BDI architecture to implement BDI agents. However, Jadex utilizes XML format to represent plans, beliefs and goals which are the core of the PRS BDI agents. Although XML is a suitable format for exchanging data, it does not add any semantic to the data that it represents. Approach: In contrast, in our proposed Ontology driven PRS like model (O-PRS), we used Ontology with OWL format to represent Believes, Plans and Events. Our Ontology had been designed particularly for implementing BDI agents which are used in Mobile Workforce Brokering Systems (MWBS), a multi-agent system that automated the process of allocating tasks to Mobile Workforces. Results: This research was an endeavor to equip the PRS model with Ontology and semantic knowledge representation and reasoning capability. In this study firstly, our proposed model was formulated, then the model was been examined using a simulation tool (MWBS-SIM) which simulated MWBS in its Initialization phase. We used JADE to implement the Agents, Protégé OWL to create the Ontology and Jena as a semantic web platform by means of which MWBS is able to connect to the Ontology and apply the O-PRS model. Conclusion: The result of our simulation showed that O-PRS is a feasible approach. Furthermore, Ontology provided better means for knowledge sharing and navigation therefore, multi-agent systems constructed using O-PRS, were more generic and more adaptable in comparison with those that use XML. © 2010 Science Publications. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

The description of intelligent behavior states how well an agent can solve and represent variety of problems of the domain-independent task. The intelligence of an agent is considered in terms of its learning capabilities. In this study, we are exploring solving 8-Queens combinatorial problem using SOAR symbolic cognitive architecture. An 8-Queens problem consists of various constraints which is expressed by Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). The constraints are further generalized in the Fuzzy Constraint Satisfaction Problem (FCSP) (a sub domain of CSP), which simplifies the condition of constraints by providing the priority value to the location of queen. This paper provides a way to solve 8-Queens problem by using a heuristic search and backtracking. These concepts are implemented in SOAR to find an efficient solution of similar task. The implementation of 8-Queens in SOAR provides computation efficiency in solving and a way for an agent to learn their own production rules to solve similar domain problems. The 8-Queens problem is analyzed by two parameters. First parameter defines how an agent can learn and transfer rules to solve similar domain problem.

Statistical methods-based agent algorithms can be improved in terms of generalizability and interpretability using symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as logic programming. In this study, we present a model-free RL architecture that is supported with explicit relational representations of the environmental objects. For the first time, we use the PrediNet network architecture in a dynamic decision-making problem rather than image-based tasks, and multi-head dot-product attention network (MHDPA) as a baseline for performance comparisons. We tested two networks in two environments -i.e., the baseline box-world environment and our novel environment, relational-grid-world (RGW). With the procedurally generated RGW environment, which is complex in terms of visual perceptions and combinatorial selections, it is easy to measure the relational representation performance of the RL agents. The experiments were carried out using different configurations of the environment so that the presented module and the environment were compared with the baselines. We reached similar policy optimization performance results with the PrediNet architecture and MHDPA. Additionally, we achieved to extract the propositional representation explicitly -which makes the agent's statistical policy logic more interpretable and tractable. This flexibility in the agent's policy provides convenience for designing non-task-specific agent architectures.

GIS model integration involves combining diverse spatial algorithms—such as buffer analysis, network analysis, spatial regression, and machine learning models—to tackle multifaceted geographic challenges. Key algorithms are systematically integrated to optimize outcomes in urban planning, disaster management, and precision agriculture. For instance, land-use change prediction synthesizes spatial regression, machine learning, and remote sensing, while natural disaster systems merge meteorological models with post-disaster assessments. The fusion of industry-specific models with GIS enhances location-based decision support by embedding spatial variables into domain workflows. Cloud-native architectures and AI-driven automation emerge as pivotal trends, offering scalable, real-time GIS solutions via platforms like serverless computing and SaaS. These innovations promise self-learning agents capable of automated spatial pattern recognition, real-time alerts, and optimized resource allocation. Despite progress, challenges persist in model selection, interpretability, and robustness. Future research directions emphasize large language model (LLM)-powered agents for intelligent geospatial processing, cloud-GIS hybrid platforms for elastic resource management, and industry-tailored SaaS solutions. By bridging traditional GIS tools with intelligent service ecosystems, this evolution aims to drive digital transformation, enhance cross-sector competitiveness, and unlock new potentials in spatial decision-making. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.52088/ijesty.v5i3.1185,"International Journal of Engineering, Science and Information Technology","Reinforcement Learning (RL) is quickly becoming a powerful way to predict failures and improve systems in large cloud environments before they happen. Unlike traditional reactive methods, RL lets smart agents learn the best actions by interacting with changing environments and using reward signals to improve system uptime, resource use, and reliability. As cloud-based big data systems get bigger and more complicated, they also become more likely to have problems that slow them down or cause them to fail at random times. To deal with these problems, we need more than just advanced failure prediction algorithms. We also need adaptive, explainable systems that help people understand what's going on and step in when necessary. This paper looks into how to use RL to help predict and manage failures in cloud-based big data systems. We suggest a layered architecture that uses RL agents and generative explanation models to predict failures and take steps to stop them. We focus on real-time feedback loops, autonomous learning, and outputs that can be understood. This is especially important in anomaly detection pipelines, where explanations need to be detailed but short. We show how reinforcement learning agents can find patterns of risk and take steps to avoid them by using examples from real-world hyperscale data centers. We also look at how generative models, like transformer-based language generators, can turn complicated telemetry data into information that people can understand. At the end of the paper, the authors suggest areas for future research, such as safe RL deployment, multi-agent coordination, and explainable policy design. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

10.5220/0010762100003116,International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence,"Reinforcement learning has driven impressive advances in machine learning. Simultaneously, quantum-enhanced machine learning algorithms using quantum annealing underlie heavy developments. Recently, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) architecture combining both paradigms has been proposed. This novel algorithm, which utilizes Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) for Q-value approximation has outperformed regular deep reinforcement learning in terms of time-steps needed to converge. However, this algorithm was restricted to single-agent and small 2x2 multi-agent grid domains. In this work, we propose an extension to the original concept in order to solve more challenging problems. Similar to classic DQNs, we add an experience replay buffer and use different networks for approximating the target and policy values. The experimental results show that learning becomes more stable and enables agents to find optimal policies in grid-domains with higher complexity. Additionally, we assess how parameter sharing influences the agents’ behavior in multi-agent domains.

10.5220/0012261100003636,International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence,"Modeling of real-world biological multi-agents is a fundamental problem in various scientific and engineering fields. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework to generate flexible and diverse behaviors in cyberspace; however, when modeling real-world biological multi-agents, there is a domain gap between behaviors in the source (i.e., real-world data) and the target (i.e., cyberspace for RL), and the source environment parameters are usually unknown. In this paper, we propose a method for adaptive action supervision in RL from real-world demonstrations in multi-agent scenarios. We adopt an approach that combines RL and supervised learning by selecting actions of demonstrations in RL based on the minimum distance of dynamic time warping for utilizing the information of the unknown source dynamics. This approach can be easily applied to many existing neural network architectures and provide us with an RL model balanced between reproducibility as imitation and generalization ability to obtain rewards in cyberspace. In the experiments, using chase-and-escape and football tasks with the different dynamics between the unknown source and target environments, we show that our approach achieved a balance between the reproducibility and the generalization ability compared with the baselines. In particular, we used the tracking data of professional football players as expert demonstrations in football and show successful performances despite the larger gap between behaviors in the source and target environments than the chase-and-escape task. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",

However, the microservice provision to execute such applications with achieving a high Quality of Service (QoS) and low bandwidth communications. Thus, the container-based microservice scheduling problem in a hybrid Fog and Cloud environment is a complex issue that has yet to be fully solved. In this work, we first propose a container-based microservice scheduling model for a hybrid architecture. Our model is a multi-objective scheduler, named DRL4HFC, for Hybrid Fog/Cloud architecture. It is based on two Deep Reinforce Learning (DRL) agents. DRL-based agents learn the inherent properties of the various microservices, nodes, and environments to determine the appropriate placement of each microservice instance required to execute each task within the Business Process (BP).

In the second pathway, the sender and receiver read an image and minimize the distance between the generated symbols. In the first pathway, language emerges with the Levenshtein distance of ≤ 2 for 96% of messages.

This research is framed in the development of an agent-based architecture to provide demand response services in an Energy Community to optimise the management of renewable energy sources and provide grid stability. The proposed MPC is a key enabler of cooperative demand response strategies at community level, ensuring the allocation of an optimal demand profile at each participating member of the community according to an optimal consumption reference defined by a complementary agent at community level. The MPC calculates the optimal setpoints of the HVAC system's terminal units, considering the expected usage of the buildings and the outdoor conditions, and exploiting the building's thermal inertia. The models embedded in the MPC are grey-box models representing a thermal zone of the building. To reduce measurement and model uncertainties, these models incorporate self-learning capabilities implemented as Moving Horizon Estimators that perform a continuous calibration based on real-time operational measurements. This solution allows full automation for model calibration and management of the terminal units. This paper presents a case study in which a baseline MPC with fixed model parameters obtained by an offline calibration is compared to the Building Optimizer with self-learning capabilities. The Building Optimizer is able to track a requested power consumption providing up to 20% of flexibility compared to the reference consumption without demand management and guaranteeing thermal comfort, at least 98% of the time. For this scenario, the Building Optimizer proves more reliable in guaranteeing the thermal comfort and a better match to the requested consumption compared to the baseline MPC.
