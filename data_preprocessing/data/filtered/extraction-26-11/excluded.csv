10.1002/rob.22374,Optimization-based motion planning for autonomous agricultural vehicles turning in constrained headlands,"Headland maneuvering is a crucial part of the field operations performed by autonomous agricultural vehicles (AAVs). While motion planning for headland turning in open fields has been extensively studied and integrated into commercial autoguidance systems, the existing methods primarily address scenarios with ample headland space and thus may not work in more constrained headland geometries. Commercial orchards often contain narrow and irregularly shaped headlands, which may include static obstacles, rendering the task of planning a smooth and collision-free turning trajectory difficult. To address this challenge, we propose an optimization-based motion planning algorithm for headland turning under geometrical constraints imposed by headland geometry and obstacles. Our method models the headland and the AAV using convex polytopes as geometric primitives, and calculates optimal and collision-free turning trajectories in two stages. In the first stage, a coarse path is generated using either a classical pattern-based turning method or a directional graph-guided hybrid A* algorithm, depending on the complexity of the headland geometry. The second stage refines this coarse path by feeding it into a numerical optimizer, which considers the vehicle's kinematic, control, and collision-avoidance constraints to produce a feasible and smooth trajectory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing it to the classical pattern-based method in various types of headlands. The results show that our optimization-based planner outperforms the classical planner in generating collision-free turning trajectories inside constrained headland spaces. Additionally, the trajectories generated by our planner respect the kinematic and control limits of the vehicle and, hence, are easier for a path-tracking controller to follow. In conclusion, our proposed approach successfully addresses complex motion planning problems in constrained headlands, making it a valuable contribution to the autonomous operation of AAVs, particularly in real-world orchard environments. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",TOPIC
10.1016/j.artint.2022.103696,Analyzing generalized planning under nondeterminism,"In automated planning, there has been a recent interest in solving a class of problems, where a single solution applies for multiple, possibly infinitely many, instances. This necessitates a generalized notion of plans, such as plans with loops. However, the correctness of such plans is non-trivial to define, making it difficult to provide a clear specification of what we should be looking for. In an influential paper, Levesque proposed a formal specification for analyzing the correctness of such plans. He motivated a logical characterization within the situation calculus that included binary sensing actions. This characterization argued that from each state considered possible initially, the plan should terminate while satisfying the goal. Increasingly, classical plan structures are being applied to stochastic environments such as robotics applications. This raises the question as to what the specification for correctness should look like, since Levesque's account makes the assumption that actions are deterministic. In this work, we aim to generalize Levesque's account to handle actions with nondeterministic outcomes, which may also be accorded probabilities. By appealing to an extension of the situation calculus to handle probabilistic nondeterminism, we will show that Levesque's definition, as well as a notion of goal achievability proposed by Lin and Levesque, have limited appeal under stochastic nondeterminism. In essence, they correspond to one correct execution, which is unlikely to be adequate. Rather, we propose to delineate between goal satisfaction and termination leading to a range of correctness criteria. To better study these criteria, and to position the results in a broader context while still allowing for the generality of the situation calculus, we consider an abstract framework to study the correctness of plans with loops, in domains that are possibly unbounded, and/or stochastic, and/or continuous. Within that framework, we then prove numerous relationships between the criteria, including some impossibility results for categorically satisfying goals. Finally, we show that these notions provide a more granular view than those discussed in the literature, such as strong planning and strong cyclic planning. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",TOPIC

Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative enabler of battery health management, offering capabilities beyond traditional models. This review provides a structured synthesis of recent progress in AI-enabled diagnostics. Advances in state estimation—including state of health (SOH) and remaining useful life (RUL)—are first examined, with methodological breakthroughs identified across diverse task formulations. The evolution of AI architectures is then traced, from conventional neural networks to attention-based Transformers, physics-informed models, and federated learning, with particular attention to emerging paradigms such as foundation models, neuro-symbolic reasoning, and quantum machine learning that promise improved robustness and interpretability. To bridge laboratory innovation with deployment, a domain-adaptive four-stage data pipeline has emerged as a promising framework for real-world BMS signals—spanning operational segmentation, multi-scale denoising, degradation-aware feature engineering, and structured sample construction—designed to enhance generalization under heterogeneous and noisy conditions. Looking forward, a technological roadmap is outlined that integrates edge AI, digital twins, AIOps, quantum computing, wireless sensing, and self-repair systems. Collectively, these innovations transform batteries from passive energy reservoirs into intelligent cyber-physical agents endowed with perception, autonomous decision-making, and resilient fault response—paving the way toward truly battery-centric autonomous energy systems. © 2025 Science Press",TOPIC
10.1016/j.robot.2025.105167,Hybrid of representation learning and reinforcement learning for dynamic and complex robotic motion planning,"Motion planning is the soul of robot decision making. Classical planning algorithms like graph search and reaction-based algorithms face challenges in cases of dense and dynamic obstacles. Deep learning algorithms generate suboptimal one-step predictions that cause many collisions. Reinforcement learning algorithms generate optimal or near-optimal time-sequential predictions. However, they suffer from slow convergence, suboptimal converged results, and unstable training. This paper introduces a hybrid algorithm for robotic motion planning: long short-term memory (LSTM) and skip connection for attention-based discrete soft actor critic (LSA-DSAC). First, graph network (relational graph) and attention network (attention weight) interpret the environmental state for the learning of the discrete soft actor critic algorithm. The expressive power of attention network outperforms that of graph in our task by difference analysis of these two representation methods. However, attention based DSAC faces the problem of unstable training (vanishing gradient). Second, the skip connection method is integrated to attention based DSAC to mitigate unstable training and improve convergence speed. Third, LSTM is taken to replace the sum operator of attention weigh and eliminate unstable training by slightly sacrificing convergence speed at early-stage training. Experiments show that LSA-DSAC outperforms the state-of-the-art in training and most evaluations. Physical robots are also implemented and tested in the real world. © 2025 The Author(s)",TOPIC

This paper introduces an optimization method for supply-demand interaction, grounded in blockchain technology and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). By incorporating smart contracts and a multi-level virtual power plant (VPP) architecture, coordinated regulation of power resources and efficient peer-to-peer energy trading both within and beyond the park's confines are achieved. Specifically, the paper delineates the design of a blockchain-based distributed energy management system (DEMS) that integrates multi-agent DRL mechanisms, enhancing the adaptability and response speed of the industrial park. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method markedly outperforms traditional approaches in terms of flexibility, energy efficiency, and economic benefits, underscoring its extens ive application potential in the future energy management of intelligent industrial parks.",TOPIC
10.1049/icp.2025.2737,Adaptive MPC and nonlinear tracking control for non-holonomic robots in cluttered spaces,"This paper presents the implementation of trajectory planning and control for a non-holonomic robotic platform. Non-holonomic systems introduce significant challenges in motion planning and control due to their kinematic constraints. The proposed approach integrates graph-based path planning with trajectory optimization and employs both nonlinear control and model predictive control (MPC) for accurate trajectory tracking. The kinematic model of a unicycle-type robot is utilized, and two path planners Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM) and Hybrid A* are evaluated, with Hybrid A* selected for its ability to generate kinematically feasible paths. Trajectory optimization is formulated as a nonlinear optimal control problem, solved using direct single-shooting and multiple-shooting methods, with the latter proving more robust. A quadratic cost function penalizes state and input deviations while enforcing obstacle avoidance through geometric constraints. For trajectory tracking, a nonlinear feedback controller and an MPC-based approach are implemented and compared. Simulation results demonstrate that the nonlinear controller achieves precise tracking, while MPC exhibits robustness with slight oscillations in heading angle regulation. The study concludes that combining optimization-based trajectory planning with advanced control strategies ensures stable and efficient navigation for non-holonomic robots in constrained environments.",TOPIC

In this paper, a hierarchical multi-agent system (MAS) architecture is proposed, which includes environmental awareness layer, agent decision-making layer and coordination and optimization layer, so as to realize intelligent planning of transmission line cable path. A distributed path optimization algorithm based on Multi-Agent Systems (MAS-DPOA) was further designed, incorporating the advantages of the Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). This approach achieves rapid path optimization through the collaborative search by agents and genetic operations. Meanwhile, a distributed conflict detection mechanism based on MAS (MAS-CDCM) was proposed, utilizing the local sensing capabilities and communication mechanisms of agents to detect and report conflicts in real-time. Through the case study analysis of a 220kV transmission line in a mountainous area in southwestern China, the results show that compared with traditional methods, the MAS-DPOA method can reduce path length by 12.5%, decrease tower base costs by 18%, and increase conflict detection accuracy to 96%. It significantly reduces the volume of engineering work and minimizes social impact, offering an efficient and accurate solution for transmission line route planning with promising application prospects.",TOPIC

Within the context of autonomous navigation, path planning is relevant for comfortability, safety, execution time and energy savings. In this paper, we propose an approach to suggest smooth paths from observed robot trajectories by optimizing fitting and smoothness criteria using Differential Evolution with distinct modes of initialization, selection pressure, exploration and exploitation. Our rigorous computational experiments using a relevant set of real-world robot trajectories from the Boe-Bot mobile robot architecture show the feasibility and efficiency of our approach in computing smooth curves, suggesting the superior performance of the greedy initialization scheme based on the triangular convex hull of the robot trajectory, and Differential Evolution with exploitative and parameter adaptation schemes such as Rank-Based Differential Evolution (RBDE), Adaptive Differential Evolution with External Archive (JADE) and Strategy Adaptation Differential Evolution (SADE).

We want to find a method to predict the velocity and course of this robot, which can help us realize the accurate control of it. The paper proposed a promising type of hybrid robotic fish (HRF), which can realize two kinds of motion modes on the sea surface. Firstly, the configuration and dynamic model of the HRF were analyzed elaborately. Then, to realize accurate velocity prediction under two kinds of motion modes of HRF, the influence factors are presented in a complex marine environment. Based on the influence factors to its maneuverability, such as wind or wave parameters, a velocity prediction algorithm based on back-propagation neural network (BPNN) was introduced. However, BPNN has the disadvantages of extended learning and training time, easily falling into local optimum. Then we found that genetic algorithm (GA), which is a kind of evolutionary algorithm, is suitable for our problem. Therefore, the accuracy and efficiency of the prediction algorithm were improved by adopting the genetic algorithm to optimize the weight and threshold of BPNN. Taking the experimental data from the pool test, the back-propagation neural network with genetic algorithm (GA-BPNN) forecasting model was established. Besides, the other prediction methods were compared and evaluated under the same assessment criterion to validate the proposed forecasting model. The experimental results demonstrate that the GA-BPNN model has higher accuracy and efficiency compared with other prediction algorithms, which verifies the feasibility of the velocity prediction model for hybrid robotic fish in complex ocean environments.",TOPIC
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3017561,"STEP-NC Architectures for Industrial Robotic Machining: Review, Implementation and Validation","In the manufacturing sector, industrial robots are being increasingly improved to execute machining tasks as they exhibit significant advantages in terms of flexibility, cost-effectiveness, affordability, and larger work-space when compared to traditional computer numeric control (CNC) machines. However, programming this kind of equipment for robotic machining is complex, due to closed architecture controller and proprietary programming languages limitations. For that reason, this work aims at contributing to the adoption of the STEP-NC standard (STandard for the Exchange of Product model data- Numerical Control (ISO 10303-238 and ISO 14649)), generating programs for robotic machining operations. The STEP-NC data model enables the integration of information from design, process planning, simulation, manufacturing, and even inspection in a single platform, which could create new alternatives for industrial robotic machining programming. In this context, several previous studies are described in this manuscript aiming to highlight the contribution of this work, in addition to the analysis, implementation, and validation of six different STEP-NC architectures describing the advantages that each architecture provides for achieving robotic machining capabilities.

The search directions in these algorithms use the convex combination of the modified Barzilai and Borwein spectral parameters (IMA journal of numerical analysis, vol. 8, no. 1, pp. 141-148, 1988) and their geometric mean proposed by Dai et al.

10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3069744,"RT-TelSurg: Real Time Telesurgery Using SDN, Fog, and Cloud as Infrastructures","This paper proposes a novel and efficient real time network architecture, named RT-TelSurg, for one of the most appealing tactile Internet applications, i.e., Telesurgery. In telesurgery, the patient's vital signs and status and the required robotic commands during the surgery should be received on time. Otherwise, the life of the patient or the safety of the operation is endangered. Hence, transmitted packets should meet their respective relative deadlines. Software-defined networking is a relatively new architecture for computer and telecommunications networks in which the network control plane is separated from the data plane. One way to achieve real time telesurgery is to employ cloud and fog networks using SDN as infrastructure. By using a real time cloud controller in the SDN as the core and a fog controller on the edge of the network on the master (physician) side, one may satisfy the acceptable level of the timing constraints of the telesurgery. Accordingly, based on the presented architecture, we develop the statistical performance model of our proposed approach, RT-TelSurg. This statistical queuing theory model is designed for critical and non-critical states of the network. Based on these states, network resources are allocated to telesurgery data in both modes, and a computational bottleneck is detected. RT-TelSurg is evaluated according to real time and surgery efficiency parameters. The results show that the average deadline hit ratio is 98.2% in different conditions, which is quite acceptable for telesurgery applications.",TOPIC
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3095392,Speeding-Up Action Learning in a Social Robot With Dyna-Q+: A Bioinspired Probabilistic Model Approach,"Robotic systems that are developed for social and dynamic environments require adaptive mechanisms to successfully operate. Consequently, learning from rewards has provided meaningful results in applications involving human-robot interaction. In those cases where the robot's state space and the number of actions is extensive, dimensionality becomes intractable and this drastically slows down the learning process. This effect is specially notorious in one-step temporal difference methods because just one update is performed per robot-environment interaction. In this paper, we prove how the action-based learning of a social robot can be improved by combining classical temporal difference reinforcement learning methods, such as Q-learning or Q( λ), with a probabilistic model of the environment. This architecture, which we have called Dyna, allows the robot to simultaneously act and plan using the experience obtained during real human-robot interactions. Principally, Dyna improves classical algorithms in terms of convergence speed and stability, which strengthens the learning process. Hence, in this work we have embedded a Dyna architecture in our social robot, Mini, to endow it with the ability to autonomously maintain an optimal internal state while living in a dynamic environment.",TOPIC
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3139080,Multi-Robot Hybrid Coverage Path Planning for 3D Reconstruction of Large Structures,"Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is an essential capability for autonomous robots operating in various critical applications such as fire fighting, and inspection. Performing autonomous coverage using a single robot system consumes time and energy. In particular, 3D large structures might contain some complex and occluded areas that shall be scanned rapidly in certain application domains. In this paper, a new Hybrid Coverage Path Planning (HCPP) approach is proposed to explore and cover unknown 3D large structures using a decentralized multi-robot system. The HCPP approach combines a guided Next Best View (NBV) approach with a developed Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) waypoint prediction approach to decrease the CPP exploration time at each iteration and simultaneously achieve high coverage. The hybrid approach is the new ML paradigm which fosters intelligence by balancing between data efficiency and generality allowing the exchange of some CPP parts with a learned model. The HCPP uses a stateful LSTM network architecture which is trained based on collected paths that cover different 3D structures to predict the next viewpoint. This architecture captures the dynamic dependencies of adjacent viewpoints in the long term sequences like the coverage paths. The HCPP switches between these methods triggered by either the number of iterations or an entropy threshold. In the decentralized multi-robot system, the proposed HCPP is embedded in each robot where each one of them shares its global 3D map ensuring robustness. The results performed in a realistic Gazebo robotic simulator confirmed the advantage of the proposed HCPP approach by achieving high coverage on different 3D unknown structures in a shorter time compared to conventional NBV.",TOPIC
10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3173647,TeMoto: A Software Framework for Adaptive and Dependable Robotic Autonomy With Dynamic Resource Management,"For widespread deployment of robots in challenging environments (fire fighting, search and rescue, planetary exploration, etc.), the software of the robot must allow for reliability and adaptability. For many existing systems, an unexpected change in mission specification, component failures, or energy conservation requires downtime for adaption (redesign of mission logic, switching sensor data processing pipeline, etc.). This is because software and hardware components for robotic applications are commonly chosen or designed based on task requirements and integrated either directly in the source code or via system configuration scripts, such as ROS launch files, leading to a fixed monolithic design. As the necessity and extent of adaptive behaviors is not always known prior to deployment, the structure of a robot’s software needs to support it by design. In this paper, we propose TeMoto, a novel architecture for adaptive autonomous robots, and a ROS-based framework of openly available software tools that implement the TeMoto architecture. TeMoto is a developer tool which combines dynamic (run-time) task and resource management, encourages modular and scalable system design and is task and platform agnostic - TeMoto provides the foundation for an adaptive robotic system. The feasibility of the TeMoto framework is qualitatively assessed via experiments on single and multi-robot setups spanning common scenarios (teleoperation, autonomous surveillance, cargo delivery, etc.). TeMoto-based systems exhibit increased fault tolerance and dynamic reconfigurability of software and hardware resources, as well as up to a 47% reduction in power consumption compared to the non TeMoto-enabled reference setup.",TOPIC

Firstly, a distributed imaging satellite mission planning model with variable collaborative division of labor is constructed based on multi-agent system theory. The model defines the intelligence level of satellites in the satellite cluster and the interaction mode between satellites. Secondly, the cooperation mechanism between satellite agents is established based on blackboard model.

Although highly expressive, deep neural networks are black-box models, making their usage challenging in this safety-critical applications of autonomous racing. On the other hand, physics-based models provide high safety guarantees for the predicted trajectory but lack accuracy. The method presented in this paper targets this trade-off. We introduce a method to predict the trajectories of opposing racecars with deep neural networks considering physical constraints to restrict the output and to improve its feasibility. We report the method’s performance against an LSTM-based encoder-decoder architecture on data acquired from multi-agent racing simulations. The proposed method outperforms the baseline model in prediction accuracy and robustness.

Furthermore, it showcases robustness under increased noise conditions. By applying our framework to a complex multi-throw suturing task, we illustrate its capability to seamlessly handle comprehensive suturing tasks, including needle picking, insertion, extraction, and the handover of the needle between Patient Side Manipulators. The results suggest that our hybrid approach not only enhances ARSS autonomy but also adapts effectively to unexpected environmental changes, laying the groundwork for its potential applicability in real-world surgical robotics.",TOPIC
10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3321276,A Self-Supervised Learning Solution With Momentum-Based Siamese Network for Robotic Visual Task,"How a robot induces causality, abstracts information from states, and plans for tasks are major challenges in artificial intelligence. However, habitually used deep reinforcement learning is not a cure-all solution. This study proposes MoSN, a momentum-based Siamese network for a robotic visual task. Instead of trying to learn representations that abstract all the variation factors of the environment as in most prior studies, MoSN labels its observations as their causes so that it can learn representations of visual states in a self-supervised manner. These representations are then used to enhance perceptual and cognitive abilities and to perform our robotic visual task when a robot takes over a new environment. In particular, this study proposes a momentum-based Siamese network with augmentation methods and a hybrid explicit contrastive loss to improve the combinatorial generalization capability of our model.

We introduce EAMOS (Execution of Aerial Multidrone Missions and Operations Specification Framework), which allows us to specify missions intuitively, text-based, and provides a mission compiler, a mission middle layer, and a distributed drone execution environment. The middle layer wraps the control of individual drone-specific capabilities, such as launch, fly to position, or perform a maneuver, into a public API that transparently utilizes the capabilities of numerous drone platforms. We exploit the Go programming language to implement critical components of the framework and provide an interface for ROS-based drone platforms. EAMOS automates the mission execution on real, virtual, and even hybrid robotic setups involving real and virtual drones. We demonstrate the successful deployment of EAMOS with four missions executed on Pixhawk/PX4-equipped quadcopters and virtual drones simulated with Airsim. We assess the performance of our proposed approach by analyzing the number of nodes and arcs of the mission graphs, which are an essential artifact of our mission compilation, the utilization of ROS service calls during mission execution, and the duration of compilation, deployment, and mission execution. Overall, our experiments showed that our drones correctly behaved during mission execution as expected and specified by their mission, the generated mission artifacts were efficiently manageable, and processing times allowed for a fluent workflow.",TOPIC

Unlike conventional robot arms, which perform predefined tasks, intelligent robot arms have autonomy and can operate in changing environments, interact with other machines, and collaborate with humans. In this regard, adaptive path planning is crucial for intelligent robot arms, involving real-time environment monitoring and path generation to continuously update the robot’s trajectory based on changes in the surroundings. This paper presents an adaptive path planning method for intelligent robot arms to be used in dynamic environments. The proposed method is based on a hybrid active-passive approach and has been tested in a dynamic workspace simulation environment. The results indicate the ability of the proposed method to respond dynamically in a complex scenario where the target is fluctuating, and an obstacle is intentionally placed in the robot’s path. Additionally, real-time analysis results show that the method can be categorized as real-time path planning with less than 100 ms reaction time for grid sizes with less than  $96\times 96 \times 96$  cells. This insight presents opportunities for the establishment of smart factories, smart homes, and smart cities, where the presence of intelligent robot arms in dynamic environments becomes essential.",TOPIC
10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3351893,Deep Learning-Based Path Planning Under Co-Safe Temporal Logic Specifications,"This paper introduces an innovative deep learning framework for robotic path planning. This framework addresses two fundamental challenges: (1) integration of mission specifications defined through Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), and (2) enhancement of trajectory quality via cost function integration within the configuration space. The proposed method shows better efficacy compared to traditional sampling-based path planning methods in computational efficiency, due to its end-to-end neural network architecture. The framework functions in two key phases. Initially, using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), the proposed approach efficiently identifies and encodes optimal trajectory distributions. From these distributions, candidate control sequences are generated. Subsequently, a specialized neural network module selects and fine-tunes these sequences, ensuring compliance with the LTL specifications and achieving near-optimal solutions. Through rigorous simulation testing, we have validated the effectiveness of our method in producing low-cost trajectories that fulfill LTL mission requirements. Comparative analysis against existing deep learning-based path planning methods reveals our framework’s superior performance in both trajectory optimality and mission success rates.",TOPIC
10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3380004,Robot Motion Control Using Stepping Ahead Firefly Algorithm and Kinematic Equations,"The use of robots to carry out activities in various fields has evolved over the years. Robots can move from one location to another according to a plan and have a good understanding of the environment to perform their assigned tasks. Robot movements are based on motion planning and control algorithms. This paper proposes a new hybrid motion planning and control algorithm called FAStep-Kinematic (Stepping Ahead Firefly algorithm and Kinematic equations). This algorithm includes the Firefly Stepping Ahead algorithm to avoid obstacles, the equation of motion to control the movement of the robot, and a method to detect obstacles. The algorithm starts with the equation of motion and switches to the stepping ahead firefly algorithm when an obstacle is detected. The stepping ahead firefly algorithm then plans the robot’s next step to avoid obstacles. The robot moves to this step. This procedure is repeated until the robot successfully avoids an obstacle and reaches its target. The obstacles used in this article are static and are known to robots. The hybrid algorithm will be used to navigate robots in a cluttered environment. The new algorithm’s effectiveness will be seen with an application to tractor-trailer robotic systems. The results show that the robots are able to reach their destination safely and using a shorter route. Additionally, this research compared the new hybrid algorithm’s performance with that of the ACO-Kinematic (Ant Colony Optimization and Kinematic equations) algorithm in terms of path length and convergence time. The analysis show that the hybrid algorithm is superior to the ACO-Kinematic algorithm. The proposed algorithm improves the path length by 0.37%, 9.22%, and 5.79% compared to the ACO-Kinematic algorithm in three different scenarios.",TOPIC
10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3456914,ARCog-NET: An Aerial Robot Cognitive Network Architecture for Swarm Applications Development,"This work presents an advanced cognitive architecture for networked aerial robots to implement autonomous swarm systems effectively. It focuses on designing, implementing, and evaluating an architecture that enables unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to coordinate and cooperate for complex tasks, with or without human intervention. Inspired by artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and robotics, the architecture integrates perception, planning, decision-making, and adaptive learning to optimize swarm behavior in dynamic environments. The architecture uses a distributed processing model based on the “edge-fog-cloud” (EFC) concept. Edge-level robots handle real-time data collection, local decision-making, and environmental perception. Fog-level vehicles manage intermediate processing and supervision of the groups, while cloud servers perform comprehensive data analysis and long-term storage, being the higher-level hierarchy of the framework. This structure allows efficient distribution of computational tasks, with critical decisions made at the robot level and complex analysis done in the fog or cloud. The implementation of ARCog-NET involves deploying a multi-agent simulation system using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Gazebo simulator, facilitating the integration of sensors, communication protocols, and data processing algorithms. The performance evaluation demonstrates the architecture’s effectiveness in a wind farm inspection scenario, where the UAV swarm exhibits improved trajectory planning, collision avoidance, and data processing efficiency. Simulation results show that ARCog-NET reduces latency, increases data throughput, and enhances operational effectiveness, providing a robust platform for future developers to focus on applications and direct robot control methods.",TOPIC

This paper presents a novel hybrid robot with three translational and three rotational movements. A systematic mechanical design methodology on the basis of the screw theory is proposed to comprehensively search for feasible five-degrees-of-freedom parallel structures. The usage of only planar kinematic joints is beneficial to large translation/rotation reachable workspaces. A parallel robot is chosen to construct a six-degrees-of-freedom hybrid structure. Both the position and velocity relations between the actuators and the mobile platform are established for the parallel unit. Sloping linkages in the curved shape instead of the straight shape are employed to improve the range of motion of the corresponding rotary joints. Both the translation/rotation workspaces are investigated and the manipulability measure is explored. The novel mean manipulator velocity ratio index is developed and examined on this parallel robot. A multi-objective optimization based on an evolutionary algorithm is conducted.",TOPIC
10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3473792,Collaborative Autonomous Navigation of Quadrotors in Unknown Outdoor Environments: An Active Visual SLAM Approach,"The development of an integrated path-planning and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (ASLAM) system, specifically designed for the autonomous and real-time guidance of quadrotors navigating through unexplored outdoor environments helps to map the generation of unknown natural resources. To achieve this goal, a path-planning methodology that leverages system observability is exploited for a quadrotor. This path-planning method is underpinned by the eigenvalues of the Gramian matrix, which are used as a measure of system observability degree, to increase the precision of the quadrotor’s estimated position. In SLAM, high accuracy in the quadrotor’s state estimation improves the accuracy of the map landmarks position estimation. To enhance the accuracy and fortify system robustness, implementing a centralized distributed architecture within a group of three quadrotors is advocated. In this setup, the role of a central hub for information fusion from all agents and determining the most observable path for the entire group is assigned to the leader quadrotor. An assessment of the proposed path-planning method against a random path-planning approach within a single-agent architecture is conducted across various scenarios. This evaluation compares the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the quadrotor’s state estimation. The results illustrate a notable improvement in accuracy. Furthermore, a comparison is conducted to assess the performance of the multi-agent architecture in contrast to the single-agent architecture using the proposed method. The simulation and experimental results confirm a better accuracy in all scenarios and highlight the increased robustness of the cooperative architecture, particularly in fault scenarios, compared to a single-agent architecture.",TOPIC
10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3481426,Flexit: Flexible Location Encoding for Item Access in Medication Management Systems,"In hospitals and pharmacies, the demand for efficient medication management (e.g., item storage and access) is rapidly increasing, and the scale of medication management systems is gradually expanding. Intelligent medication management systems based on Internet of Things (IoT) can enhance the system efficiency and largely save labor costs through contactless medication dispensing and robotic item access. A typical medication management system that can store medicines usually includes several cabinets, each cabinet contains several drawers, and each drawer contains medicine boxes. In this paper, we propose, Flexit, a framework of flexible location encoding schemes that can encode the locations of cabinets, drawers, and boxes for efficient item access in an intelligent medication management system. Flexit includes a human/user interface, a central control unit, and a medication storage system, built upon medicine cabinets. Given storage space constraints, we propose a hybrid data compression method that combines trees and bitmaps, which is further optimized according to Huffman coding principles. Additionally, given a location code, the user/robot is capable to decode a number of locations, and Flexit employs a location-aware path planning algorithm to help access the stored items at these decoded locations at the minimal time-distance combined cost. We evaluate the performance of the data compression and path-planning algorithms through experiments over datasets, which show superior performance compared to existing methods, i.e., the compression algorithm can save 5-10 times the storage space on average, and the path-planning algorithm can reduce the system’s runtime by 20-50%.",TOPIC
10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3562078,Ultrasound-Based Visual Servoing for Out-of-Plane Longitudinal Needle Tracking in Robot-Aided Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy,"Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is a minimally invasive procedure to remove large renal calculi through a small incision in the patient’s back. Ultrasound (US) imaging is commonly used to guide the needle to the kidney during this procedure. However, it requires an advanced level of dexterity to coordinate the US probe and the needle to keep the needle visible in the images at all times. Failure to maintain needle-probe alignment can result in inadvertent injury, bleeding, and other complications. The use of robotic assistance can alleviate the surgeon’s cognitive workload by enabling autonomous positioning of the US probe and accurate needle tracking. This paper presents a new US-guided visual servoing (VS) algorithm for needle tracking using longitudinal US images of a needle subjected to out-of-plane motion. The ultrasound probe can move in 4 degrees-of-freedom (DOF), that is, two translations and one rotation in the imaging plane, and one rotation out of the imaging plane. Unlike previously reported VS algorithms, 4-DOF tracking is achieved using only 2D-US images and without any additional position sensor or prior knowledge of the needle trajectory. The algorithm is validated extensively in three different experimental scenarios using a water tank, a tissue phantom, and ex-vivo porcine tissue. Results obtained from several trials confirm the algorithm’s ability to track the needle and maintain needle-probe alignment with an average error of 1.5 mm, despite an out-of-plane average needle deflection of 7 mm along a 60 mm insertion depth.",TOPIC
10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3566389,Combined Multi-Agent and Centralized Resource Allocation in Cloud Radio Access Networks,"The fifth generation (5G) mobile network is designed to facilitate high data rates with massive connectivity with the benefit of small cell technology. The cloud radio access network (C-RAN) is a promising mobile network architecture that can meet the ever-increasing resource demand of a growing number of users. In C-RAN, base station functionalities are separated into baseband units (BBUs) and remote radio heads (RRHs), with BBUs centralized and virtualized via cloud computing. However, this architecture introduces new challenges in efficiently allocating resources to dynamic users. This paper aims to design a resource allocation scheme that improves system efficiency and satisfies dynamic user demands in C-RAN. We propose a hybrid resource allocation approach that combines centralized control and multi-agent-based decision-making. The centralized controller, located within the BBU pool, collaborates with virtual base stations (VBSs) acting as multi-agent system (MAS) agents. The resource allocation solution is derived by jointly considering the real-time resource requests from agents and the historical demand estimates generated by the centralized controller. Through simulation-based evaluation, we compare our proposed scheme with conventional random and fixed resource allocation methods. The results demonstrate improved performance in terms of resource utilization, reduced unfulfilled demand, and fairness among VBS agents. The proposed combined resource allocation strategy effectively meets dynamic user requirements while maintaining system efficiency in C-RAN. Our work highlights the importance of integrating historical demand trends with real-time agent requests for improved long-term resource planning.",TOPIC
10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3580222,Neural-Augmented Hybrid Dynamic Modeling of a Series-Parallel Elastic Actuator,"This paper proposes a neural network-based model of a novel hybrid Series-Parallel Elastic Actuator (SEA-PEA) architecture for high-performance robotic applications. The system combines a Brushless DC (BLDC) motor, a planetary gearbox, and a rotary pneumatic actuator serving as an elastic element. While the gearbox offers advantages such as low cost and back-drivability, it suffers from significant backlash due to manufacturing tolerances. To address this, the actuator connects the gearbox output shaft directly to that of the pneumatic actuator. For a parallel configuration, both stators are mounted on an aluminum holder supporting the entire assembly. Within the backlash region, the system behaves as a Series Elastic Actuator (SEA), with the pneumatic actuator’s elasticity influencing stiffness, damping, and inertia. Outside this region, the system transitions to a Parallel Elastic Actuator (PEA), rigidly coupling the motor and gearbox shafts. A hybrid modeling approach is introduced to capture the actuator’s dynamic response. The SEA behavior is modeled using a closed box Artificial Neural Network (ANN), specifically an Echo State Network (ESN), which showed the lowest mean squared error (MSE) among the tested architectures. The PEA behavior is modeled using a gray-box approach, combining a linear dynamic block with a nonlinear static block represented by an ANN (Wiener model). This hybrid framework, integrating an ESN, achieved lower prediction error and better performance than other ANN architectures, as confirmed by experimental results.",TOPIC
10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3585989,New Energy and CCUS Thermal Power Synergistic Peaking Cost Model and Apportionment Optimization Strategy,"Driven by the global carbon neutral strategy, the large-scale application of Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) technology has significantly weakened the peaking margin of thermal power units, and the traditional peaking cost allocation model fails to take into account the inequitable distribution of costs faced by the carbon capture power plants participating in peaking. This study proposes a peaking cost quantification method based on multidimensional characterization. In terms of temporal characteristics, the scenario substitution method is used to quantify the participation of different peaking entities in peaking; in terms of spatial characteristics, the initiative constraints of unit peaking are taken into account to ensure that each peaking entity actively participates in peaking and profits from it. Considering the impact of carbon capture power plants’ participation in peak shifting on carbon emission reduction and carbon cost, we constructed a dynamic peak shifting model for multiple subjects. We innovatively construct a two-layer architecture of “spatio-temporal two-dimensional quantization and dynamic game sharing”, and adopt the improved kernel method to establish a coalition reorganization trigger mechanism to solve the unfair sharing of peaking costs when carbon capture power plants participate in peaking. Taking the improved IEEE34 node as an example, the results show that the established cost calculation model can accurately calculate the peak shaving cost of each unit in different scenarios. The total cost of thermal power peak shaving using CCUS is 6.5% lower than that of conventional thermal power units, which significantly verifies the effectiveness of CCUS technology in reducing the economic burden of peak shaving. When the carbon price is 150-250 yuan/ton, the carbon emission is reduced by 40%-50%, which highlights the dual advantages of the model in deep emission reduction and carbon price co-optimization, and the cost increase is  $\le 5$ %, which proves the feasibility of achieving large-scale carbon emission reduction under the premise of strictly controlling the economic cost. On the basis of completing energy conservation and emission reduction, the peak regulation task is completed at the minimum cost, and the unity of economy and environmental protection is achieved. Compared with the Shapley value method, the correlation coefficient of the contribution of the kernel method is increased to 0.91, which indicates that the accuracy of the proposed method for the evaluation of multi-agent contribution is significantly improved, and the fairness of the peak-shifting cost-sharing model of the kernel method is significantly improved, which provides a reliable solution for solving the problem of cost allocation imbalance between traditional power supply and CCUS units.",TOPIC

However, existing reinforcement learning methods still face multiple challenges in complex environments, such as sparse rewards, insufficient exploration, slow convergence, and limited generalization capabilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes an improved version of the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm. The algorithm incorporates an n-step return mechanism to enhance the modeling of long-term dependencies, and introduces a dynamic hybrid exploration strategy that combines Gaussian noise with Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) noise to improve exploration stability and training efficiency. In addition, a shaped reward function is constructed by integrating several key factors, including distance to the target, heading alignment, obstacle avoidance, and time efficiency, to provide continuous feedback during the learning process. The proposed method is validated on the Gazebo simulation platform. Experimental simulation results show that, compared to the original algorithm, the improved version increases the success rate by 37% in complex static environments and by 28% in dynamic obstacle scenarios. The approach significantly accelerates training convergence and enhances policy generalization, effectively demonstrating its practicality for robotic path planning tasks.",TOPIC
10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3609454,HADP: Hybrid A*-Diffusion Planner for Robust Navigation in Dynamic Obstacle Environments,"Autonomous driving in dynamic environments requires the ability to rapidly perceive changes and make safe, efficient decisions. While numerous studies have explored learning-based planning methods to address this challenge, diffusion-based planning methods have recently emerged as a promising approach in robotic path planning by modeling action sequences as probabilistic trajectories and capturing diverse planning behaviors under uncertainty. However, they still face significant challenges in generalizing to unseen situations and demand extensive data collection to achieve robust performance. In particular, efforts to ensure general robustness by learning from all possible scenarios can introduce inefficiencies, as many cases may be irrelevant during actual deployment. To address these challenges, this study proposes the Hybrid A*-Diffusion Planner (HADP), designed to achieve robust navigation performance even in unseen dynamic environments. In obstacle-free environments, HADP employs the A* algorithm for global path planning, whereas when a dynamic obstacle is detected within a predefined boundary, it records observations and leverages a conditional diffusion model to generate a local avoidance path. After avoidance, the path is re-planned using A*. To enable the diffusion model to generate effective avoidance paths, a semantic map is constructed by incorporating key environmental information within the predefined boundary. This map, along with the robot’s position and local goal information, serves as a conditional input to the diffusion model. HADP is trained on an expert trajectory dataset created by recording expert-driven navigation across various dynamic obstacle avoidance scenarios. Experiments in various simulations in dynamic obstacle environments demonstrated HADP’s superior success rate, trajectory smoothness, and robust generalization performance in unseen environments compared to existing approaches. Real-world tests further confirmed its practical applicability and highlighted its potential as a robust and scalable solution for dynamic obstacle environments, and the simulation code used in this study is publicly available at https://github.com/DSLab-MJU/HADP",TOPIC

Environmental point cloud data is obtained using a Realsense depth camera, and the GSNet network is employed to extract global environmental features, generating key information for path planning. The motion planning module utilizes LSTM and MDN networks to predict the next motion pose of the robotic arm, generating a Gaussian mixture distribution for the next joint state. The specific next joint state is determined through Gaussian sampling. A collision detection module is integrated into the path planning process to validate the feasibility of the generated joint states. If collision detection fails beyond a certain threshold, a strategy combining the Artificial Potential Field (APF) method and the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm is employed. This approach overcomes local minima issues and achieves local obstacle avoidance, ensuring the feasibility and smoothness of the path. Experimental results demonstrate that this method effectively integrates the advantages of deep learning and traditional hybrid path planning algorithms. It not only improves planning efficiency but also adapts to the motion planning requirements of complex environments, providing an efficient solution for robotic motion planning.",TOPIC

Exploration, utilizing one or few rovers may restrict the scouting range causing a lack of discovery of hidden environments.

10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172592,Development of On-orbit Assembly Demonstrator in 3U CubeSat Form Factor,"The use of robotics in space has become common in the last half century of space exploration. However, robotic arms are rarely entrusted to perform large assembly tasks without a human in the loop because of the high cost of the hardware involved. As our presence in space grows, developing advanced autonomous robotic systems may be the way forward as time lags associated with teleoperation can easily cripple future space missions operating beyond earth orbit. This research focuses on the derivation of an autonomous control system for spacecraft assembly applications that blends Jacobian path following and visual servoing. Jacobian path following assumes the environment is well known and plans end effector trajectories whose performance for assembly may suffer in dynamic or uncertain environments. Visual servoing approaches use feedback from an effector attached camera and can avoid dynamic obstacles, but provides no guarantee of success if the sensor cannot keep the goal location in its field of view and often traverses inefficient manipulator trajectories. This work proposes a hybrid approach that combines both approaches to improve the performance of a robotic manipulator in both known and unknown environments. The robotic systems are simulated using the proposed hybrid controller. The hybrid controller is developed in MATLAB using a kinematic simulation of a two degree of freedom robotic arm operating in a single plane with a simplified camera model. Following successful implementation of the simulation, a more complex robotic arm is simulated in 3D space. The controller is integrated into an existing robotic arm platform (UR5 Industrial Manipulator) for a proof of concept.

Phenomena of interest include flows or variations in volatiles, gas composition or concentration, particulate density, or even simply temperature. Improved measurement of these processes enables understanding of exotic geologies and distributions or correlating indicators of trapped water or biological activity. However, such data is often needed in unsafe areas such as caves, lava tubes, or steep ravines not easily reached by current spacecraft and planetary robots. To address this capability gap, we have developed miniaturized, expendable sensors which can be ballistically lobbed from a robotic rover or static lander - or even dropped during a flyover. These projectiles can perform sensing during flight and after anchoring to terrain features. By augmenting exploration systems with these sensors, we can extend situational awareness, perform long-duration monitoring, and reduce utilization of primary mobility resources, all of which are crucial in surface missions. We call the integrated payload that includes a cold gas launcher, smart projectiles, planning software, network discovery, and science sensing: PHALANX. In this paper, we introduce the mission architecture for PHALANX and describe an exploration concept that pairs projectile sensors with a rover “mothership.” Science use cases explored include reconnaissance using ballistic cameras, volatiles detection, and building timelapse maps of temperature and illumination conditions. Strategies to autonomously coordinate constellations of deployed sensors to self-discover and localize with peer ranging (i.e. a “local GPS”) are summarized, thus providing communications infrastructure beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) of the rover. Capabilities were demonstrated through both simulation and physical testing with a terrestrial prototype. The approach to developing a terrestrial prototype is discussed, including design of the launching mechanism, projectile optimization, micro-electronics fabrication, and sensor selection. Results from early testing and characterization of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components are reported. Nodes were subjected to successful burn-in tests over 48 hours at full logging duty cycle. Integrated field tests were conducted in the Roverscape, a half-acre planetary analog environment at NASA Ames, where we tested up to 10 sensor nodes simultaneously coordinating with an exploration rover.

In order for humanity to create a sustainable lunar presence, well-developed collaboration between humans and robots is necessary to perform complex tasks. This paper presents a methodology to assess the human factors, situational awareness (SA) and cognitive load (CL), associated with teleoperated assembly tasks. Currently, telerobotic assembly on an extraterrestrial body has never been attempted, and a valid methodology to assess the associated human factors has not been developed. The Telerobotics Laboratory at the University of Colorado-Boulder created the Telerobotic Simulation System (TSS) which enables remote operation of a rover and a robotic arm. The TSS was used in a laboratory experiment designed as an analog to a lunar mission. The operator's task was to assemble a radio interferometer. Each participant completed this task under two conditions, remote teleoperation (limited SA) and local operation (optimal SA). The goal of this experiment was to establish a methodology to accurately measure the operator's SA and CL while performing teleoperated assembly tasks. A successful methodology would yield results showing greater SA and lower CL while operating locally. Performance metrics measured in this experiment showed greater SA and lower CL in the local environment, supported by a 27% increase in the mean time to completion of the assembly task when operating remotely. Subjective measurements of SA and CL did not align with the performance metrics. This brought into question the validity of the subjective assessments used in this experiment when applied to telerobotic assembly tasks. Results from this experiment will guide future work attempting to accurately quantify the human factors associated with telerobotic assembly. Once an accurate methodology has been developed, we will be able to measure how new variables affect an operator's SA and CL in order to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of telerobotic assembly tasks.",TOPIC

It is intended that this ISRU excavator concept be capable of material extraction from native regolith, and will be able to operate in a variety of planetary surface environments after initial shakedown on the moon. Using heritage from highly multi-functional, reconfigurable robotic systems like the All-Terrain Hex-Limbed Extra-Terrestrial Explorer (ATHLETE), Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operations Robot (RASSOR), and Mars exploration rovers, we propose a flexible maintenance-optimized mobility platform concept with quick-connect/disconnect features for robotically swappable excavation implements. Dust tolerant torque transmission, power & data docking, thermal fluid connectors, and modular avionics and instrumentation will allow for autonomous swapping of tools, replacement of spares, and longterm maintenance of robotic excavators. The architecture includes modular tools for conventional excavate / scoop / haul / dump / process functions of a terrestrial mining operation on Earth, but also will have the capability to operate and robotically maintain itself without human intervention. The concepts described in this study will provide a suite of technologies, configurations, and operations ready for inclusion into a final flight-ready excavator system.",TOPIC
10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172722,Expectations for Backward Planetary Protection Planning During Mars Sample Return Planning,"During the current phase of robotic exploration, Mars missions plan to search for evidence of extinct or extant biological activity. The conceptual mission architecture for Mars Sample Return (MSR) must demonstrate robust containment and rigorous control of all unsterilized materials as assurance of no inadvertent harm to Earth's biosphere. Launch of NASA's drilling and caching Mars rover in summer 2020 could potentially be the first step in an extraordinary campaign to bring carefully collected and sealed samples of sedimentary and igneous rocks from Mars to Earth for scientific study. As part of this notional architecture, NASA would launch a sample return platform early as 2026 to land near the area explored by the Mars 2020 rover and ESA would launch separately an Earth Return Orbiter (ERO). A small ESA fetch rover would depart from the platform and drive rapidly to locations where samples tubes have been placed on the ground for retrieval. The fetch rover and/or the Mars 2020 rover could return to the platform, allowing a robotic arm to transfer samples tubes into a sample container on a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV). The sample container would be launched and then released by the MAV in Mars orbit where the waiting ERO would capture the container and seal it in a doubled-walled containment canister. Various combinations of sterilization and dust mitigation are under consideration for breaking the chain of contact with putative contaminants. Minimizing the area of surfaces exposed to Martian dust and performing one or more sterilization procedures are key options for compliance with backward planetary protection prior to departure from Mars orbit. Once landed on Earth, entry vehicle inspection followed by additional cleaning and biobarrier deployment would ensure safe handling during transport to a state-of-the-art receiving facility. Herein, we describe NASA and ESAs joint coordination efforts with COSPAR to engage disciplinary experts across academic, regulatory, and industrial organizations to discuss current technology for life detection and sample safety protocols for handling and studying Mars materials on Earth.",TOPIC
10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438347,An Innovative Approach to Modeling VIPER Rover Software Life Cycle Cost,"NASA's “Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover” (VIPER) will be the first robotic mission to prospect for water ice near the south pole of the Moon in late 2023 on a 100-Earth-day mission. The information that the VIPER rover provides will help improve understanding of the composition, distribution, and accessibility of Lunar polar volatiles and will help determine how the Moon's resources can support future human space exploration. VIPER, however, represents a radical departure from the way that NASA has traditionally developed planetary robotic missions. A key consequence of these differences is that estimating the cost of VIPER's rover software is challenging and complex. For example, VIPER is being developed using management procedures typically applied to NASA research and technology projects, rather than space flight programs. In addition, key portions of the rover's software are being designed as ground software to run on mission control computers (rather than onboard the rover as flight software as with prior planetary missions) taking advantage of continuous, interactive data communications between the Moon and Earth and higher performance computing available on the ground. Moreover, the rover's software is being engineered using Agile software development practices and incorporates a significant amount of open-source code, rather than following traditional (spiral, waterfall, etc.) development methods and in-house code. In this paper, we present an innovative process to estimate the life cycle cost of VIPER's rover software. We first describe how we modeled the architecture and code counts for three software elements: Rover Flight Software (RFSW), Rover Ground Software (RGSW), and Rover Simulation Software (RSIM). We then discuss key challenges and unique aspects of our approach, such as the lack of Lunar rover analogies, the need to integrate and test large open source software, and the strategies developed to account for use of non-space flight management practices and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conclude with a summary of our results, including cumulative distribution, nearest neighbors and cluster analysis, as well as heuristics used to confirm the reasonableness of the cost estimate.",TOPIC

This paper will offer an overview of the operational capabilities of the Gateway Network defined in the Network Concept of Operations, focusing on the initial architecture of the Gateway Spacecraft Inter-Element Network. The initial Gateway modules include Habitation, Power & Propulsion, Logistics, Human Lunar Lander, and Orion Crew Capsule. The Gateway Inter-Element Network Concept of Operations is a source for the network functions, which in turn inform the design, development, implementation, testing, and verification of the spacecraft hardware. End system hardware on the network includes, but is not limited to, a mobile robotic arm, internal and external cameras, flight control hardware, environmental control systems, power and propulsion systems, critical alarms, telemetry, and payloads, in addition to any hardware present on a visiting vehicle or lunar exploration vehicle. This paper will also provide an overview of how the design and operations of the Gateway Avionics network are defined by the Gateway Program design and safety requirements. Implementation of avionics and command and data handling strategy will provide the Gateway program with reliable infrastructures that allow operational options for both human control while occupied, and highly autonomous control during periods of vacancy. The Gateway Avionics network architecture will be able to handle seamless in-flight reconfigurations and expansion as new modules and the capability to interface with additional visiting vehicles are added.",TOPIC
10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843445,Expert-Informed Autonomous Science Planning for In-situ Observations and Discoveries,"Future planetary exploration missions on the surface of distant bodies such as Europa or Enceladus can't rely on human-in-the-loop operations due to time delays, dynamic environments, limited mission lifetimes, as well as the many unknown unknowns inherent in the exploration of such environments. Thus our robotic explorers must be capable of autonomous operations to ensure continued operations and to try to maximize the amount and quality of the scientific data gathered from each mission. To advance our technology toward this goal, we are developing a system to maximize the science obtained by a robotic lander and delivered to scientists on Earth with minimal asynchronous human interaction. The autonomy architecture consists of three main components: Shared Science Value Maps (SSVMs), which function as an interface between REASON (Robust Exploration with Autonomous Science onboard) and RECOURSE (Ranked Evaluation of Contingent Opportunities for Uninterrupted Remote Science Exploration) for efficient and useful scientific communication between scientists and robot. The key advantage to this design is in its ability to continuously operate and adapt despite the constraints of high-latency, low-bandwith communications and an uncertain environment which today would require ground-in-the-loop operations. This paper presents the overview of our architecture and initial results on the development of such a system. These results will focus on progress made in developing the details of the SSVM interface between human scientists and robotic explorer and the ability of REASON to act on the SSVM to develop plans on-board that attempt to maximize science obtained while being guaranteed to respect any relevant system and safety constraints.",TOPIC
10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843530,Hybrid Planning to Minimize Platform Disturbances during In-orbit Assembly Tasks,"In-orbit space assembly has been proposed as a method to overcome the obstacles for deployment of large spatial structures. To make such assemblies economically feasible, they must rely on robotic arms to perform the required manipulation actions. The operations with the robotic arm inevitably affect the attitude and orientation of the spacecraft. This influence is well understood for simple trajectories; however, assembly sequences for full structures require multiple repetitive motions, with and without load, which significantly affect the attitude and orbital control of the satellite. This paper analyzes such perturbations for a complex assembly task, the construction of the primary mirror for a space telescope, using a hybrid planner with two levels: a low level that considers individual motions of the robotic arm, and a high level that generates the overall assembly sequence while minimizing the perturbations created on the attitude control system. The method effectively minimizes perturbations during orbital assembly tasks, therefore minimizing fuel or energy consumption in the spacecraft.",TOPIC
10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843610,Towards a Semi-Autonomous Robotic Exploration of a Lunar Skylight Cavity,"This study evaluates the feasibility of a robotic exploration mission to a skylight located in the Marius Hills region on Moon. The study is based on theoretical evaluations while making use of existing results from previous and currently running projects. Parts of the approach were already evaluated by autonomously navigating and mapping in a lava tube and other field trials in analogue environments. We address a solution to access and map a lunar lava tube with a semi-autonomous heterogenous team of exploration rovers. Main systems are: 1) a surface rover, which serves as anchoring point, communication relay and power generator, 2) a highly mobile exploration micro rover foreseen to rappel down into the skylight for tube exploration and 3) a tether management and docking system which can be attached to the exploration rover to safely lower it into the lava tube and serve as power and communication hub during cave exploration. For descending we propose a rappelling approach using tethering and actively controlled hybrid legged-wheels on the exploration rover. The rover uses path planning to avoid obstacles on its way down the vertical surface. When the bottom of the skylight is reached, the tether spool is deployed as docking station. After successful deployment, different autonomy levels are possible -from remote-controlled to fully autonomous- to explore the unknown environment.",TOPIC
10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843722,Test as you Fly: Using Flight Telemetry in the Mars 2020 Uplink Simulation & Validation Process,"Mars2020's approach to command load simulation & validation steered away from heritage design early on in Mission System development. Whereas previous missions used Sequence Generator (SeqGen) to validate their command load, Mars2020 chose to adapt software originally developed for Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), Surface Simulation (SSim), in order to meet new mission performance requirements. This decision meant a complete redesign of the surface mission uplink commanding validation architecture, but it also provided room for meaningful improvements. SSim is a Flight Software (FSW)-in-the-loop sequence and command simulator, enabling much faster than real-time execution. It was originally developed for MSL Rover Planners to simulate and validate their commanding of rover mobility, robotic arm, and sampling activities. For Mars2020, SSim has since been expanded to include the modeling of system-level functions such as power, telecommunications, and instruments. It affords the operations team the ability to simulate commanding in a very flight-like manner, a significant change from the heritage process involving the use of SeqGen. Using a FSW-in-the-loop simulator for uplink command validation provides several key advantages over heritage simulation tools. Because of the similarity between SSim and the rover FSW, the Mars2020 validation process is able to routinely incorporate the latest known state of the flight vehicle into the validation tools, ensuring that the simulation and validation initial condition used in uplink planning is the best possible representation of the onboard state. A set of new tools and new and improved processes developed for Mars2020 enable this usage of flight vehicle state in uplink planning, and by doing so, prevent divergence between spacecraft state tracked on the ground and the real state of the rover on Mars. The adoption of SSim for uplink command validation completely redesigned the surface validation process. The development of this design presented many novel challenges resulting in key decisions and trades that could not directly leverage heritage designs or experience. This study will discuss the formulation of, and key decisions involved in, the Mars2020 surface validation process architecture in hopes of serving as a blueprint for future missions.",TOPIC
10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843799,Design and Model Predictive Control of a Mars Coaxial Quadrotor,"Mars has been a prime candidate for planetary explo-ration of the solar system because of the science discoveries that support chances of future habitation on this planet. The Mars exploration landers and rovers have laid the foundation of our understanding of the planet's atmosphere and terrain. However, the rovers have presented limitations in terms of their pace, travers ability, and exploration capabilities from the ground and thus, one of the main field of interest for future robotic mission to Mars is to enhance the autonomy of this exploration vehicles. Martian caves and lava tubes like terrains, which consists of uneven ground, poor visibility and confined space, makes it impossible for wheel based rovers to navigate through these areas. In order to address these limitations and advance the exploration capability in a Martian terrain, this article presents the design and control of a novel coaxial quadrotor Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV). As it will be presented, the key contributions on the design and control architecture of the proposed Mars coaxial quadrotor, are introducing an alternative and more enhanced, from a control point of view concept, when compared in terms of autonomy to Ingenuity. Based on the presented design, the article will introduce the mathematical modelling and automatic control framework of the vehicle that will consist of a linearised model of a co-axial quadrotor and a corresponding Model Pre-dictive Controller (MPC) for the trajectory tracking. Among the many models, proposed for the aerial flight on Mars, a reliable control architecture lacks in the related state of the art. The MPC based closed loop responses of the proposed MAV will be verified in different conditions during the flight with additional disturbances, induced to replicate a real flight scenario. For the model validation purpose, the Mars coaxial quadrotor is sim-ulated inside a Martian environment with related atmospheric conditions in the Gazebo simulator, which will use the proposed MPC controller for following an a priory defined trajectory. In order to further validate the proposed control architecture and prove the efficacy of the suggested design, the introduced Mars coaxial quadrotor and the MPC scheme will be compared to a PID-type controller, similar to the Ingenuity helicopter's control architecture for the position and the heading.",TOPIC

10.1109/AERO55745.2023.10115601,Hardware Autonomy for Space Infrastructure,"NASA prioritizes autonomous systems development with the expectation that it will continue to drive significant improvements in human and science exploration capability. Crew operations benefit from a spectrum of machine assistance to complete replacement of dangerous or highly repetitive tasks. Many science operations have a teleoperation component, and similarly benefit from a range of autonomy implementations that make long distance applications feasible. As we consider longer duration deep space missions, we also consider higher levels of autonomy in order meet emergent safety, maintenance, and logistics needs. One of the challenges within this scope is installation and maintenance of infrastructure, such as large scale instrumentation and communications equipment, crew habitats, and operational facilities. We describe how a programmable meta-material architecture may shift the paradigm of how we design, build, and operate future space infrastructure and assets. A primary objective of this strategy is to free the design space from launch vehicle constraints and fundamentally shift how a mission is designed and conducted. This integrates advances in materials (mechanical meta-materials), manufacturing (cooperative mobile robotics), and autonomy (multi-agent planning algorithms). Engineering systems that utilize a modular and reconfiguration building block approach, such as digital communication and computation systems, currently lead in terms of size and complexity scalability. NASA is extending the benefits and flexibility of digital systems to hardware systems, to optimize materials life-cycle management and expand our space exploration mission capabilities to meet long duration and deep space infrastructure needs, in accordance with long term NASA goals of “in-space reliance” and “mass-less exploration.”",TOPIC
10.1109/AERO55745.2023.10115804,The Evolution of Command and Sequencing at JPL: Origins and Flight Software Core Lineage,"Since launching the first American satellite Explorer 1 in 1958, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has led the world in robotic space exploration. Throughout the history of the lab, subsequent missions have traveled deeper into space, explored more challenging environments, lasted longer, attempted more ambitious science, and returned orders of magnitude more data. This paper is the first in a planned series to document the history of how JPL has commanded its spacecraft in order to achieve the increasingly daring and demanding goals of its missions. This first effort focuses primarily on the onboard technologies associated with JPL's Flight Software (FSW) Core Product Line (FCPL), the Mars rover missions that preceded it, and the Cassini mission to Saturn. It also provides a brief discussion of pre-Cassini missions in order to provide context. Other JPL sequencing technologies (namely VML and the open source F Prime Flight Software) are not discussed in detail here but will instead be the subject of future work, as will any detailed discussions on ground-based software developed to support JPL projects and the interface between onboard autonomy and sequencing. The paper explores the challenges of the more assembly-like sequencing languages common before the mid-1990s (Cassini), the significant paradigm shift that came with the Faster, Better, Cheaper era and Mars Pathfinder (MPF), the development of conditional sequencing for the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER), the SPAM scripting language of Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) and Mars 2020 (M20), the latest developments in the deep space orbiters Psyche and Europa Clipper, and a preliminary look at Sample Retrieval Lander (SRL). VML is also discussed as needed to contextualize the features in JPL's sequencing architecture that were written in response to it. The paper also explores the broader concept of spacecraft behavior. Modern spacecraft behave in highly complex ways and sequencing is only one place where spacecraft designers and operators can encode that complexity. As such, the trades needed to define a sequencing system must take this broader landscape into account. Other important modes of encoding spacecraft behavior include physical hardware, flight software, and real time commanding. Finally, the paper discusses the flexibility JPL's different command and control solutions give to operators to change behaviors in flight. While some sequencing systems are robust enough to resolve complex anomalies or react to unforeseen circumstances in flight, many are not. Historically, JPL's flight system designers have provided many methods to change behavior outside of the normal cadence of design and test, creating a large trade space to do so in flight.",TOPIC
10.1109/AERO55745.2023.10115827,Design of a Novel Lunar Transportation System (FLOAT) consisting of Diamagnetically-Levitated Robots on a Flexible Film Track,"A durable, long-life robotic transport system will be critical to the daily operations of a sustainable lunar base in the 2030's, as envisioned in NASA's Moon to Mars plan and mission concepts like the Robotic Lunar Surface Operations 2 (RLSO2), to transport regolith mined for ISRU consumables (H2O, LOX, LH2) or construction, and transport payloads around the lunar base and to / from landing zones or other outposts. In this work, we present component analysis, preliminary experimental results, and system designs for a novel lunar transportation system, FLOAT (Flexible Levitation on a Track), that leverages diamagnetically levitated robots. Unlike current lunar robot concepts that use wheels (SEV, RASSOR), legs (Spidernaut), or hybrid wheels-on-legs for mobility, FLOAT robots are solid-state (no motors, gearboxes, or other moving parts) and consist only of permanent magnets connected in planar arrays levitating to minimize lunar dust abrasion / wear over a flexible PCB track that generates electromagnetic thrust. Results show that FLOAT robots can maintain extremely low power requirements over a range of terrains – using <5 W/m2 or <0.15 W/kg to carry up to 30 kg/m2 payload on tracks with slopes <40° and curves >5 m in-plane radius or >25 m out-of-plane radius – and use 10-100x less power for transport than wheeled vehicles. For initial system deployment, we designed track deployments robots which can leverage existing lunar robotic systems to un- roll segments of FLOAT tracks onto the lunar regolith. Finally, system design analysis shows the FLOAT concept can serve as a complete transportation system to satisfy the volumetric flow requirements of the RLSO2 mission concept.",TOPIC
10.1109/AERO55745.2023.10115856,An Analysis of Exploration Capability Gaps for Future Habitation Systems to Inform Risk Assessment and Development Priorities,"Within NASA, exploration capability gaps are defined as the difference between the current state-of-the-art in capabilities and the anticipated needs of future human spaceflight architectures. As NASA and its partners' capabilities for human exploration of deep space continue to mature, it is necessary to understand the capability gaps that require closure to support future habitation systems, such as the Lunar Surface Habitat (SH) and Mars Transit Habitat (TH) currently in concept development. This paper will identify high-priority capability gaps for exploration habitation and show potential options for gap closure through investment in technology, development, and testing. High-priority capability gaps are divided into the following general taxonomy areas: human health/life support/habitation systems, flight computing and avionics, power and energy storage, communications and navigation, thermal management systems, human exploration destination systems, autonomous systems, sensors and instruments, GNC (guidance, navigation, and control), robotic systems, ground and uncrewed surface systems, and materials/structures/mechanical systems/manufacturing. In the gap identification process, teams of discipline experts from across NASA reviewed the latest habitation architecture needs against current capabilities to understand where gaps may exist. The results of the assessment established a basis for the current state-of-the-art within each gap and identified the capability needs of the proposed exploration missions the gap links to. An assessment of how each test platform (e.g., Ground, International Space Station (ISS), Commercial Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Gateway) may be leveraged to mature capabilities and potentially provide a route to gap closure will be discussed. The notional timeline for gap closure to support reference missions and impacts to overall schedule are also assessed where appropriate. Based on the capability gap analysis described above, the paper summarizes important technology maturation considerations for human exploration architectures, with a focus on the Mars TH. The previously published NASA habitation ground rules and assumptions document is used as the basis to classify gaps as enabling, enhancing, or “push” opportunities for a particular architecture. Stepwise technology maturation plans/considerations are presented for some selected critical gaps. Overall, the analysis in this paper is intended to help influence development priorities for habitation systems, where high-priority, critical gaps are those currently assessed as having a low probability of closure by the anticipated need date. Capability gap analysis also informs the risk register for exploration habitation systems and mitigation strategies to ensure readiness of key technologies to support future mission timelines. Linkage between capability gaps for Moon and Mars is noted, as closure of a gap at a Lunar destination may subsequently enable or enhance Mars TH architectures.",TOPIC

NASA launched the Lunar Communication Relay and Navigation System (LCRNS) project in 2022 to meet the needs of the Artemis missions and other lunar missions. ESA, JAXA, other space agencies, and commercial entities may contribute additional lunar relay orbiters that are compatible with the NASA’s orbiters via the LunaNet Interoperability Specifications.To ensure sustained human presence at the Moon, NASA plans to deploy surface infrastructure elements that can survive the lunar nights. We are investigating the operation concept and PNT performance of augmenting the lunar relay network with a surface station with the following capabilities: 1. Provide short-range time distribution to orbiting and surface spacecraft. 2. Transmit a GNSS-like signal to augment the orbital determination (OD) schemes of lunar spacecraft for fast OD convergence. The transmitter can also act as a surface beacon that guides the lunar spacecraft during dynamic events like decent and ascent. 3. Receive lunar relay orbiter’s and Earth’s GPS signals and estimate corrections for orbiting spacecraft. This enables improved OD performance and accurate relative navigation of users on the lunar surface. The Joint Doppler Ranging (JDR) method requires as few as one orbiter to perform a real-time position fix of a surface user. This is particularly useful during the early stage of lunar relay network deployment when the number of orbiters is small.The lunar surface station architecture is directly applicable to the Mars relay network, and this supports the NASA Moon-to-Mars initiative.",TOPIC

This campaign is composed of multiple spacecraft, landers and robotic systems that collaborate to collect, retrieve, and ultimately return a diverse set of Martian rock and regolith samples. The Sample Recovery Helicopter (SRH) is a team of hybrid aerial-ground robots designed as a backup system to transport sample tubes from the surface of Mars to the Sample Retrieval Lander (SRL) for transport to Earth. An SRH robot is required to perform accurate drives from helipads to sample tube pick up or drop off locations and to handle sample tubes with a manipulator arm. The mobility system has a four wheel skid-steer configuration with 10cm diameter wheels, a maximum rock-height traversal capability of 5.0cm, and a total mass of less than 150g. This paper presents the system-level design of the autonomy system for driving SRH during surface operations. A prototype platform is used to quantitatively evaluate a motion planning and control strategy to position the robot above a desired pose in preparation for sample-tube pick ups.

10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521067,Gateway Autonomy for Enabling Deep Space Exploration,"The Gateway spacecraft is an important steppingstone to exploration of the solar system, integrating commercial and international partners into a tightly coupled system, enabling cislunar activities, and implementing key technologies for missions to Mars. Autonomy is a capability area necessary to handle long communication outages where intervention from Earth is impossible, to prepare to operate with long communication delays that will be common in interplanetary travel, and to make spaceflight more affordable and accessible by reducing sustaining operations costs. The Gateway Concept of Operations states that one of Gateway’s goals is to “focus on infrastructure and systems that will allow autonomous operations aboard the Gateway with robotics, automated systems, advanced communications, and distributed computing.”Gateway’s Vehicle Systems Manager (VSM) and associated Autonomous Spacecraft Management Architecture (ASMA) are key products towards delivering autonomous capability. The primary functions of the control architecture are Mission Management and Timeline Execution, Resource Management, Fault Management, and Vehicle Control and Operation (VCO). In each of these areas, there is an initial level of capability to be delivered at launch, with plans to continue development and grow to greater capability. The initial deployment of VSM will focus on maintaining vehicle safety by focusing on full fault management capabilities and deploying only enough resource and timeline planning functionality to support that. The final deployment of VSM will add significant planning and control optimization functionality to support nominal operations for up to 21 days without ground support, even accommodating fault and failure conditions. While the VSM is the vehicle-level representation of autonomous reasoning, distributed automation is essential to provide the right scope and abstraction of information to process. Module and system support of automation and simplicity of interfaces are two important design paradigms that Gateway is focusing on to garner a systems approach to autonomy. Distribution of reasoning can increase complexity, so Gateway is also taking a strict hierarchical approach to information flow and decision making.VSM is not the only capability necessary to achieve an autonomous spacecraft. Robotics support for maintenance of the spacecraft will be essential to provide continued vehicle functionality even when crew is not present. Technical and programmatic challenges exist when implementing autonomous robotics operations. These challenges include sufficient network flexibility to support data transfer to the rest of the vehicle to coordinate module-to-module robotic walk-offs and finding the proper interfaces to allow sufficient dexterity. Communication system upgrades planned for Gateway include Delay Tolerant Networking to best utilize the complex network of relays that will be part of mature cislunar operations. Distributed computing and management will provide failure tolerance, robustness, and growth of capabilities while still allowing significant reuse of heritage software on heritage systems as well as reuse of common applications across a spacecraft to minimize new development, but this requires adherence to key standards and interfaces.The Gateway program has demonstrated significant progress towards these capabilities and has identified challenges other spacecraft developers should be aware of from the start.",TOPIC

Considering this, development of integrated robotic systems that ensure human safety and enable maximum science and exploration during Martian missions is vital for optimal mission executions.In this paper, we propose to develop a rover assistant specifically designed for supporting the initial astronaut exploration of Mars. The primary objective of this rover is to provide assistance in diverse exploration activities and experimental endeavors, all while prioritizing the safety of the expedition team. The mission concept involves the utilization of a transportation rover to reach a specified destination. Subsequently, astronauts will be accompanied by an assistant rover to conduct site exploration. The human explorers will focus their investigations on the relatively accessible and safe regions, while the rover will traverse the more complex and hazardous terrains.As the knowledge of the red planet deepens, it is becoming apparent that many high value science targets are either craters, caves, steep hills or valleys, locations inaccessible to the conventional rocker bogie mobility systems. This paper presents a novel rover design featuring a modified hybrid mobility system. The proposed design incorporates a hexapod configuration adapted from the hybrid rover ATHLETE, modified to create a mobility system suitable for autonomous exploration. The rover will also house a vine robot for exploration of caves, crevices and deep holes which are practically inaccessible or dangerous for the rover. The front-mounted camera of the vine robot will have the capability to explore these locations in infrared wavelength for ice detection. The rover has various exploration instruments on-board which will play a vital role in gathering data for scientific research and informed decision-making, thereby enabling its automation. It employs machine vision algorithms and real-time image processing for its autonomous navigation. The rover payload contains equipment designed to offer medical support, supplementary resources, physical assistance for medical emergencies or extended exploration missions. As a part of the health monitoring architecture for this concept, the rover employs AI algorithms to analyze the data, promptly detect anomalies or health risks, and send timely alerts to the Martian surface outpost.The paper outlines the mechanical design of this rover concept and the algorithm techniques for its autonomous navigation. It also discusses the technical and operational parameters that include the subsystems, functionality, and communication system of this Martian assistant rover. The findings of this study will establish a foundation for future research. It will contribute to the advancement of long-duration space exploration for future manned missions to celestial bodies beyond our solar system.",TOPIC

However, these structures normally are not sent in one piece due to current launch vehicles’ size and load capacity limitations. An alternative is to send individual components and subassemblies and perform the final assembly of structures in orbit, mainly using robotic manipulators that execute simple manipulation tasks. However, fixed manipulator systems have limited reachability; therefore, new approaches are required to endow robotic systems with extended mobility and enhanced versatility.Several European projects have developed initial prototypes of robotic systems that could execute On-orbit services. In the MOSAR project, a 7 degrees of freedom (DoF) Walking Manipulator (WM) robot performed locomotion and manipulation (loco-manipulation) tasks for the assembly of modular satellites. In this project, the robot and the modules of the satellite were equipped with Standard Interconnects (SI), which provide mechanical, power, and data connectivity for the different components and also enable a straightforward way for their manipulation using a suitable SI as a robotic end effector. A ground scenario was developed to evaluate the system under laboratory conditions. To enhance the reachability and mobility of the WM, the project MIRROR, funded by ESA, pursued the development of a Multi-Armed Robot (MAR) capable of executing loco-manipulation tasks to assemble modular space structures. This system consists of three robotic subsystems, two 7-DoF arms attached to a torso with an extra DoF on its base.This paper presents a hybrid motion planner for generating trajectories for loco-manipulation tasks using the MAR system. The developed hybrid planner combines a high-level layer that determines the necessary contact states between the robot and the structure, and a low-level layer that plans the joint trajectories among contiguous contact states. The high-level planner implements task-dependent heuristics and a depth-first search approach to reduce the search time for possible contact states. The low-level layer implements an optimization-based motion planner, in particular the Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Motion Planning (STOMP). Using an optimization-based approach reduces the random component associated typically with sampling-based motion planners, thus generating as well smoother trajectories. STOMP used as objective function the minimization of joint torques required for executing the different tasks. The performance of the MAR system is evaluated in simulation and on a ground demonstration scenario that simulates the assembly of a modular primary mirror of a space telescope, demonstrating different tasks, including robotic locomotion and manipulation of the mirror parts.",TOPIC
10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521209,Immersive Technologies for Human-in-the-Loop Lunar Surface Simulations,"NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, continually seeks innovative solutions to enhance its operations, particularly in the realms of testing, evaluation, and training for future missions. Immersive technologies, such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality have proven to be powerful tools for immersing users in realistic, interactive, and engaging environments. This paper explores how the Simulation and Graphics Branch at NASA’s Johnson Space Center (JSC) leverages immersive technology, modern commercial rendering engines, and physics-based systems simulations to develop human-in-the-loop systems for humanity’s return to the Moon through the Artemis program.When NASA returns to the Moon, astronauts will travel to the Moon’s South Pole where lighting conditions will cause a more complex operational environment. Human-in-the-loop simulations play a crucial role in NASA’s mission planning, spacecraft and space systems development, and evaluation of operational scenarios. The development of immersive environments such as a lunar rover mockup at a video wall enables engineers and astronauts to simulate and experience mission scenarios, integrated spacecraft systems, and operational procedures in a relevant environment before deployment. By integrating realistic virtual environments, immersive technology allows for the visualization and interaction with virtual spacecraft models, mission landscapes, and complex operational tasks. This approach helps identify potential design flaws, operational challenges, and safety considerations. It also provides valuable insights for risk reduction and helps improve mission efficiency and effectiveness. With advanced motion tracking systems and custom virtual environments, data can be gathered and evaluated to help NASA refine training protocols, develop specialized training procedures, and optimize human-robotic interactions for future space missions. Furthermore, immersive technology offers opportunities for future training initiatives at NASA.The Virtual Reality Laboratory at JSC has pioneered training with Virtual Reality (VR) since the Hubble Space Telescope repair missions in the early 1990’s. Extended Reality (XR) simulations enable astronauts to rehearse complex spacewalks, spacecraft maneuvers, and extravehicular activities in a safe and controlled environment. By replicating the physical and cognitive challenges of space missions, immersive training experiences enhance astronauts’ situational awareness, decision-making abilities, and adaptability to unexpected scenarios. Additionally, immersive technology facilitates collaborative training, allowing geographically dispersed crew and mission control personnel to engage in synchronized simulations, fostering teamwork and effective communication.The adoption of immersive technology in NASA’s testing, evaluation, and future training programs has yielded significant benefits. By incorporating human-in-the-loop simulations for studies involving Extra Vehicular Activities (EVA), surface mobility and landing systems, NASA can identify and mitigate risks, optimize operational procedures, and enhance mission success. Ultimately, immersive simulation experiences can empower astronauts to better navigate the complexities of space missions, ensuring their safety, productivity, and success in the dynamic and challenging environments they will experience at the Lunar South Pole.",TOPIC
10.1109/AERO63441.2025.11068463,Robotics Capabilities Development for Mars Sample Return Transfer Activities,"The planned NASA-European Space Agency (ESA) Mars Sample Return campaign aims to be the first set of missions to bring Martian samples back to Earth, where thousands of scientists would make groundbreaking discoveries that could redefine our understanding of the Red Planet and perhaps even the origins of life on Earth. A crucial component of the circa 2023 baseline design for the missions was the transfer of sample tubes from the Martian surface to the ascent vehicle, which requires a highly dexterous robotic arm and sophisticated control strategies. Development and testing of the control algorithms were underway at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on advanced R&D testbeds, while the ESA is responsible for delivering the flight robotic arm. To meet the complex requirements for transferring the sample tubes, we propose an abstract layer consisting of three important robotics capabilities, each to be implemented for the first time in planetary exploration. 1. 7-DoF Manipulation: This capability focuses on managing the kinematics of the 7-DoF robotic arm. It includes the development of algorithms for forward and inverse kinematics, joint redundancy management, kinematic calibration, deflection compensation, target-to-pose selection, trajectory generation, and control strategies for single-joint, multi-joint, Cartesian motions, and free-space closed-loop control. 2. Robotics Vision: This capability pertains to a monocular vision system mounted on the robotic arm's end-effector with an additional redundant camera. These cameras are essential for localizing the Mars 2020 rover (M2020) tube-retrieval station, the SRL OS, identifying tubes on the Martian surface, and estimating the robotic arm's pose to ensure successful interactions with the station. 3. In-Contact Manipulation: This capability addresses the robot's interaction with its external environment. It involves load estimation using a 6-DoF force-torque sensor, force regulation (standard load-wrench control to a setpoint), and hybrid motion (force regulation orthogonal to a baseline velocity). This paper documents for posterity the infusion of these robotics capabilities, including the requirements, analysis, and testing processes that would have been necessary to ensure the success of the circa 2023 SRL Sample Transfer System design.",TOPIC
10.1109/AERO63441.2025.11068471,Progress in Planetary Protection Development for Crewed Mars Missions,"It is widely accepted that the current Planetary Protection (PP) paradigm developed for robotic spacecraft needs to change ahead of the first crewed mission to Mars. Assessing spacecraft microbial cleanliness against a quantitative bioburden threshold at launch is just not relevant for the habitable spacecraft environments that would be introduced to the Martian surface, when the astronauts themselves each have circa eight orders of magnitude more microorganisms on and in their bodies than would be permitted for a typical robotic Mars lander mission. The international COSPAR PP policy recognizes this, but also states that; “the intent of planetary protection is the same whether a mission to Mars is conducted robotically or with human explorers. Accordingly, planetary protection goals should not be relaxed to accommodate a human mission to Mars. Rather, they become even more directly relevant to such missions — even if specific implementation guidelines should differ.” The goals that are to remain the same (as described in Article IX of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty) are: i) to avoid the harmful contamination of the target solar system body (Mars in this case), and ii) to avoid adverse changes in the environment of the Earth resulting from the introduction of extraterrestrial matter. But what then are the implementation guidelines that should differ? The NASEM CoPP in its recent (2021) “Evaluation of Bioburden Requirements for Mars Missions” report declined to recommend relaxation of the present robotic requirements, noting that for such relaxation to be acceptable, any landing site needs “to be a conservative distance from any subsurface access point”, and that such a determination would also need to consider wind conditions for the location and season, and best estimates of microorganism survival time in the surface UV environment. This knowledge is simply not available at present, but this paper will provide an update on these and other “knowledge gaps” identified in a workshop series on PP for crewed Mars missions. Additionally, the paper will describe progress to incorporate the addressing of PP constraints in ongoing activities within NASA as the Moon to Mars architecture is matured. Finally, because the scientific community has been unable to provide a consensus answer to the question “How much is too much?”, in regard to the contamination that a crewed spacecraft mission might introduce to Mars, the paper will describe work to model and quantitate the microbial bioburden associated with the hardware and operations of NASA's crewed Mars surface mission concepts.",TOPIC

CCRS would consist of four key phases: (1) Launch, Commission, and Outbound Transfer, (2) Capture and Configuration of samples in Mars orbit, (3) On-Orbit Assembly of samples into Earth Entry Vehicle, (4) Protection, Jettison, and Release of the Earth Entry Vehicle (EEV). Under this architecture, the robotic (mechanical) functions during the On-Orbit Assembly phase were allocated to the Pickup, Install, and Encapsulation (PIE) subsystem. The subsystem relied on both hand calculations and ADAMS analysis to perform the multibody dynamic analysis associated with the required functions as part of establishing a preliminary design. Some key challenges entailed (a) interfaces driving system and hardware design, (b) configuration constraints (e.g. geometric, mass, resources - active vs passive), and (c) an aggressive schedule. This paper will describe the preliminary design of the subsystem as it pertains to the robotic functions, discuss key challenges and mitigations implemented, the multibody dynamics analysis, and the validation & verification plan.

10.1109/AERO63441.2025.11068537,Software for the SpaceDREAM Robotic Arm,"Impedance-controlled robots are widely used on Earth to perform interaction-rich tasks and will be a key enabler for In-Space Servicing, Assembly and Manufacturing (ISAM) activities. This paper introduces the software architecture used on the On-Board Computer (OBC) for the planned Space-DREAM mission aiming to validate such robotic arm in Lower Earth Orbit (LEO) conducted by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in cooperation with KINETIK Space GmbH and the Technical University of Munich (TUM). During the mission several free motion as well as contact tasks are to be performed in order to verify proper functionality of the robot in position and impedance control on joint level as well as in cartesian control. The tasks are selected to be representative for subsequent servicing missions e.g. requiring interface docking or precise manipulation. The software on the OBC commands the robot's joints via SpaceWire to perform those mission tasks, reads camera images and data from additional sensors and sends telemetry data through an Ethernet link via the spacecraft down to Earth. It is set up to execute a predefined mission after receiving a start signal from the spacecraft while it should be extendable to receive commands from Earth for later missions. Core design principle was to reuse as much existing software and to stay as close as possible to existing robot software stacks at DLR. This allowed for a quick full operational start of the robot arm compared to a custom development of all robot software, a lower entry barrier for software developers as well as a reuse of existing libraries. While not every line of code can be tested with this design, most of the software has already proven its functionality through daily execution on multiple robot systems. The software stack is based on a real time Linux as operating system and the middleware “links and nodes” providing topic communication and service calls as well as process manager functionality. The actual mission software is partitioned into low-level real time control software consisting of a hardware abstraction layer providing telemetry from the robot's joints as well as validating and sending commands from a controller implemented in Simulink. Non-real time modules are responsible for parameterizing the controller and reading camera and other sensor data. A mission script orchestrates the individual tasks by commanding all software components. This mission script is also responsible for tracking subsystem health and potentially disabling erroneous subsystems and is itself monitored by the OBC's hardware watchdog. Finally, a data transmission program ensures prioritized telemetry data transfer to Earth via the spacecraft. Core components of this architecture have already been tested during the 42nd DLR parabolic flight campaign under micro gravity conditions proving their effectiveness and reliability. The detailed software architecture, design choices and software tests will be described in the remainder of the paper.",TOPIC

With the this paper, we introduce a software architecture for cooperative radio navigation, which can be adapted for different experiments and hardware setups. We showcase three measurements and experiments in analogue environments with distinct requirements. First, we show how accurate time-of-flight (ToF) measurements can be achieved with single-channel SDRs and present radio channel and ranging measurements inside a lava tube. Second, we introduce a coherent multi-channel SDR setup for direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation and demonstrate cooperative radio navigation of robotic rovers on a volcano. Third, we present a two-channel SDR for hybrid lunar navigation, capable of simultaneously performing ranging with neighboring nodes and receiving satellite navigation signals. We conclude that, with careful setup and calibration, SDRs are well suited to develop flexible and accurate radio navigation systems.",TOPIC

This paper presents a novel approach to mitigating MPI effects using a combination of precise sensor calibration, a robust data acquisition pipeline, and a deep learning-based correction model. We employ an industrial-grade iToF camera to capture input data and a high-precision5 laser scanner for ground truth generation, ensuring accurate MPI characterization. A hybrid correction strategy is proposed, incorporating geometric plane fitting and a lightweight neural network trained on a combination of real-world and synthetic datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces MPI-induced depth errors from approximately 33.5 cm to 4.2 cm (∼87% reduction). The trained model is optimized for real-time inference on embedded hardware, achieving an inference time of 18 ms on GPU. These advancements significantly enhance depth sensing reliability in industrial applications, enabling more accurate floor profiling for autonomous navigation and robotic perception.",TOPIC

To minimize wiring complexity and enhance scalability, a lightweight MQTT-based communication protocol is adopted for intermodule data exchange. Furthermore, closed-loop control using a PID algorithm ensures accurate joint positioning. A functional prototype has been developed to validate the proposed design. Experimental results demonstrate MR-Robot’s capability for autonomous docking and its adaptability through transitions between active and passive joint states, confirming its potential for resilient robotic applications in challenging environments.",TOPIC

However, under non-ideal environments, the autonomous human-machine interaction of manipulators is still a challenging problem. Moreover, despite numerous advanced methods for environmental perception and planning control, deploying these intricate methods directly to manipulators with limited resources remains difficult. This paper proposes Doodbot, an edge computing assisted manipulator system for human-machine chess-playing. Under the hood, Doodbot makes a geometric model for the manipulator and adopts a model predictive control method to realize the rolling optimal control of the manipulator. Furthermore, Doodbot deploys a hybrid chess-board recognition algorithm combining traditional line detection and convolutional neural network-based image recognition, thus enjoying both the adaptiveness of the conventional method and the high recognition performance of the deep neural network. These computing tasks are offloaded to an edge node in proximity for computing capability augmentation, avoiding long-delayed execution on resource-limited manipulators. The feasibility and robustness of Doodbot are verified through realistic prototype system implementation. The experimental results show that Doodbot has improved the accuracy of chessboard perception by up to 31%. In addition, it can also correctly plan the motion trajectory of the robotic arm and reduce control errors by 36%.

Consequently, it is required to alter the current network design. SDN is a well-liked architecture because it offers customizable control and centralized management in data centers. To achieve scalability and dependability, it was necessary to propose the geographical dispersal of a logically centralized control plane due to the huge scale of networks. Software-defined networking (SDN) load-balancing optimization has been studied for a long time.

Users can achieve end-to-end communication through the satellitebased User Plane Function (UPF). However, the high dynamics of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites result in frequent inter-satellite handovers, significantly affecting user service continuity. Existing satellite handover strategies are overly simplistic and fail to ensure the Quality of Service (QoS). Additionally, ground users compete for satellite links based on limited observations, leading to network congestion. This paper proposes a loadbalanced, distributed, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning method for satellite handover. We formulate a combinatorial optimization problem to maximize the total utility of user-satellite associations across various service types. Each user acts based on local information and engages in distributed matching with satellites. Simulation results indicate that our method ensures QoS for various service types, optimizes load balancing, and outperforms basic handover strategies in terms of handover success rate and frequency.",TOPIC

Accurately forecasting pedestrian movements in dynamic and crowded environments is challenging due to factors such as unpredictable motion patterns, occlusions, missed detections, and identity switches. In this paper, we explore deep learning-based approaches for multi-frame pedestrian trajectory prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network–GRU (CNN-GRU) model. Although the CNN-GRU architecture is a known combination, our contribution lies in its practical deployment on detection- and tracking-based trajectories, generated using BoT-SORT tracking over YOLOv11 detections, and its comprehensive evaluation across three challenging benchmark datasets: MOT16, MOT17, and MOT20. The models take past trajectory sequences as input and predict future pedestrian positions, with performance measured using Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE). Experimental results demonstrate that the CNN-GRU model outperforms standalone recurrent models by effectively capturing spatial and temporal dependencies while remaining computationally efficient and suitable for real-time applications.

To address this, model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) presents a promising approach for enabling agents to make decisions under uncertainty. In this paper, we investigate the control policy of a flexible endoscope using Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA) platform. We design a flexible tendon-driven robotic endoscope (TDRE) and develop a custom simulation environment within SOFA to train DRL agents. Our approach involves implementing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to approximate an optimal policy for trajectory planning.

Before the coverage path planning, this algorithm firstly scans the complex environment, calculates an evaluation coefficient, then divides the map according to the initial position of multiple agents, and finally carries out path planning in each area to complete the map's full coverage path planning.

Most traditional path-planning methods rely on prior map information and perform poorly in complex, map-less scenarios with multiple moving obstacles and randomized goal positions. Although reinforcement learning can partially address these issues, it still suffers from sparse rewards and low sample efficiency. In this paper, we propose a hybrid navigation framework that integrates velocity obstacles (VO) priors with soft actor-critic (SAC) reinforcement learning to enhance training sample efficiency and convergence speed. At the same time, we leverage the dynamic window approach (DWA) to assist in reward function design, alleviating sparse-reward problems, and employ curriculum learning to guide the agent from simple to complex tasks. We validate our approach in the PyBullet simulation environment, and results show that, compared to both traditional reinforcement learning and classical path-planning algorithms, our method delivers significant improvements in safety, efficiency, and robustness.",TOPIC

We consider a constrained nonlinear dynamical system and assume the availability of state-input trajectories solving control tasks in different environments. A parameterized environment model generates state constraints specific to each task, which are satisfied by the stored trajectories. Our goal is to find a feasible trajectory for a new task in an unknown environment. From stored data, we learn strategies in the form of target sets in a reduced-order state space. These strategies are applied to the new task in real-time using a local forecast of the new environment, and the resulting output is used as a terminal region by a low-level receding horizon controller. We show how to i) design the target sets from past data and then ii) incorporate them into a model predictive control scheme with shifting horizon that ensures safety of the closed-loop system when performing the new task. We prove the feasibility of the resulting control policy, and verify the proposed method in a robotic path planning application.",TOPIC

The composition of omega-3 fatty acids in salmon fat is a critical food quality indicator for the salmon farming industry, as a high content contributes to a redder fillet and fewer unwanted dark spots and, consequently, leads to a higher price tag. Nowadays, Raman spectroscopy is conducted manually using a commercial all-in-one Raman system for rapid measurements in a laboratory or close to the production line. In general, this activity can be tedious, error-prone, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. To address such challenges, we propose an autonomous robotic Raman spectroscopy system synergized with a computer vision system, an AI-based learning approach, and a motion planning algorithm. We then developed a proof-of-concept demo using a Raman sensor mounted ad-hoc on a 6-DoF robot arm, an RGB-D camera, a conveyor system, and printed/natural salmon fillets, emulating a lab-scale industrial environment. All software architecture is implemented using the ROS framework and open-source Python libraries.

Recent advances in robotic manipulation hold the potential to automate the tying process, yet face challenges in accurately estimating tying poses in congested rebar nodes. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid perception and motion planning approach that integrates geometry-based perception with Equivariant Denoising Diffusion on SE(3) (Diffusion-EDFs) to enable robust multi-node rebar tying with minimal training data.

A cognitive hierarchy approach is used to model the motion of autonomous agents. We discuss potential levels of rationality and introduce a method to predict them in real-time. The rationality level prediction is achieved by observing the kinody-namic distance (KD) of other agents.

The reach-avoid game is an important problem with potential applications in air traffic control and multi-agent motion planning; however, solving this game for many attackers and defenders is intractable due to the adversarial nature of the agents and the high problem dimensionality. In this paper, we first propose an HJ reachability-based method for solving the reach-avoid game in which 2 attackers are playing against 1 defender; we derive the numerically convergent optimal winning sets for the two sides in environments with obstacles. Utilizing this result and previous results for the 1 vs. 1 game, we further propose solving the general multi-agent reach-avoid game by determining the defender assignments that can maximize the number of attackers captured via a Mixed Integer Program (MIP).

First, in a nominal setting, the analytical form of our CaRT safety filter formally ensures safe maneuvers of nonlinear multi-agent systems, optimally with minimal deviation from the learning-based policy. Second, in off-nominal settings, the analytical form of our CaRT robust filter optimally tracks the certified safe trajectory, generated by the previous layer in the hierarchy, the CaRT safety filter. We show using contraction theory that CaRT guarantees safety and the exponential boundedness of the trajectory tracking error, even under the presence of deterministic and stochastic disturbance. Also, the hierarchical nature of CaRT enables enhancing its robustness for safety just by its superior tracking to the certified safe trajectory, thereby making it suitable for off-nominal scenarios with large disturbances. This is a major distinction from conventional safety function-driven approaches, where the robustness originates from the stability of a safe set, which could pull the system over-conservatively to the interior of the safe set. Our log-barrier formulation in CaRT allows for its distributed implementation in multi-agent settings.

In addition, increased computational power in the industrial field allows the implementation of advanced control algorithms such as nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), which is an optimal control scheme that includes system and control constraints imposed by robot dynamics and the environment. Nevertheless, modeling the robot and its environment is a complicated task due to high nonlinearities, such as model uncertainties in the form of complex unmodeled dynamics, varying payloads, and parameter mismatch, leading to fast degradation of NMPC; therefore, online adaptation laws that improve the performance even in unknown environments are needed.

Teleoperating planetary rovers is a tedious task as it requires close to real-time monitoring and planning, while distance and communication delay further cripple the efficiency. Future up-scaling of off-world robotic systems deployment makes it increasingly difficult to monitor and command each agent in real-time. Thus, at least an autonomous maneuvering capability is essential to reduce the operational workload at the ground station. In order to achieve this objective, the rover is required to understand its operational environment. The rover then needs to process the information at real-time and efficiently respond in order to complete the allocated tasks or to recover from hazards.

Smooth coordination through communicating needs, plans, and actions is essential for effective teamwork. However, the impacts of different communication mediums on human factors and assembly cycle time in these hybrid teams remain in initial research stages. While direct physical communication channels, like buttons, allow for communicating the needs of a collaborative human partner, this active medium may increase operator workload and stress. In contrast, indirect visual mediums where robots interpret human behavior may reduce active control demands. Evaluating communication effects is critical as Industry 5.0 aims to improve human well-being by facilitating closer human-machine cooperation. This study compared active, direct communication through physical buttons with passive, indirect communication visually through AI-based robot observation and decision-making. 50 participants completed an assembly task across three conditions: no robot assistance, robot assistance via a direct physical medium, and assistance via an indirect visual medium (AI observing and deciding robot actions). Mental workload and stress were assessed using heart rate variability and reaction times. Assembly cycle times were manually recorded. Results showed a 17% reduction in subjective mental workload with the visual communication medium compared to manual assembly for 64% of participants. HRV analysis indicated lower stress levels in both collaborative conditions compared to manual assembly, with the physical button interface showing the lowest stress levels overall. Assembly times averaged 5% faster with AI-controlled visual communication versus direct button control.

PyPose's architecture is tidy and well-organized, it has an imperative style interface and is efficient and user-friendly, making it easy to integrate into real-world robotic applications. Besides, it supports parallel computing of any order gradients of Lie groups and Lie algebras and 2nd-order optimizers, such as trust region methods. Experiments show that PyPose achieves more than 10× speedup in computation compared to the state-of-the-art libraries. To boost future research, we provide concrete examples for several fields of robot learning, including SLAM, planning, control, and inertial navigation.",TOPIC
10.1109/CVPR52734.2025.01469,PDFactor: Learning Tri-Perspective View Policy Diffusion Field for Multi-Task Robotic Manipulation,"Robotic manipulation based on visual observations and natural language instructions is a long-standing challenge in robotics. Yet prevailing approaches model action distribution by adopting explicit or implicit representations, which often struggle to achieve a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. In response, we propose PDFactor, a novel framework that models action distribution with a hybrid triplane representation. In particular, PDFactor decomposes 3D point cloud into three orthogonal feature planes and leverages a tri-perspective view transformer to produce dense cubic features as a latent diffusion field aligned with observation space representing 6-DoF action probability distribution at an arbitrary location. We employ a small denoising network conceptually as both a parameterized loss function measuring the quality of the learned latent features and an action gradient decoder to sample actions from the latent diffusion field during inference. This design enables our PDFactor to benefit from spatial awareness of explicit representation and arbitrary resolution of implicit representation, rendering it with manipulation accuracy, inference efficiency, and model scalability. Experiments demonstrate that PDFactor outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across a diverse range of manipulation tasks in RLBench simulation. Moreover, PDFactor can effectively learn multi-task policies from a limited number of human demonstrations, achieving promising accuracy in a variety of real-world manipulation tasks.",TOPIC

Optimization-based motion planning is a popular method, since it may provide an optimal trajectory. Unfortunately, to avoid obstacle, it is always a non-convex optimization programming in real world application. Hence, it may be a high computational complexity and time-consuming task. To address this issue, this paper presents a successive convex approximation-based fast collision-free motion planning framework to address this issue. The key idea is to convert non-convex collision avoidance constraints into smooth convex constraints and use the successive convex approximation method to improve the computational efficiency. Furthermore, we incorporate the Hybrid A* algorithm to provide good initial guesses and use the Armijo step-size rule to prevent overshooting optimal solutions. The simulation results show that, compared to traditional benchmark methods, the proposed approach improves computational efficiency by an average of 83.6% in scenarios such as vertical, while also generating smoother trajectories. The method's efficiency and robustness make it more suitable for real-time deployment on low-computation platforms.",TOPIC

However, reliably modeling human movements over extended periods poses substantial challenges due to human behavior’s inherent complexity. This paper introduces STeF-LSTM, a novel hybrid predictive framework that integrates the strengths of Frequency Map Enhancement (FreMEn) for periodic pattern modeling and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for capturing sequential dependencies.

Additionally, this study proposes a polyvinyl alcohol cryogel (PVA-C) breast phantom, based on its automated segmentation approach, to enable planning and navigation experiments for robotic breast surgery. The dataset consists of multimodality breast MRI of T2W and STIR images obtained from 10 patients. A statistical analysis of segmentation tasks emphasizes the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), segmentation accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.

However, the temporary interruption of arterial flow may lead to ischemia of the renal parenchyma. Thus, the interruption of the flow should be as short as possible and the clamping should be localized to the arteries flowing towards the tumor only, by implementing the so-called selective clamping.

Conversely, RRT* handles high-dimensional spaces but has slow convergence and suboptimal paths. The hybrid algorithm (Hybrid A*-RRT*) presented in this paper addresses these limitations by combining the heuristic-driven accuracy of $A^{\ast}$ with the random exploration of RRT*. First, the algorithm generates an optimal path using A* then directionally biases RRT* sampling regions of interest, thereby reducing unnecessary node expansion and accelerating convergence. Experiments demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness across dynamically generated maze environments with varying complexity levels determined by grid cell size. Key performance metrics include path length, the nodes inspected, the number of iterations, and the computational time. In complex environments, the hybrid method reduces computation time by 80 % compared to $A^{\ast}$ and by 59 % compared to RRT*, while maintaining Path lengths within 9 % of A* optimality and exploring 48 % fewer nodes than RRT*.

By leveraging semantic representations of object geometries, gripper capabilities, and task-specific constraints, the system supports context-aware grasp candidate generation and prioritization. While the interpretation of the semantic models identifies suitable grasp types and involved geometric faces of objects and grippers, an optimization step generates suitable 6D poses that meet given constraints.

The modules have limited computational capabilities, interact only with neighboring modules, and can move around adjacent modules from a cell to an empty neighboring cell under specific conditions. An important well-studied problem for these robotic systems is Motion Planning, also known as Shape Formationor Self-reconfiguration, requiring the modules to organize themselves into a pre-determined final configuration (i.e., shape); basic shapes such as the line (or chain) are especially important as they are utilized as a foundation for constructing more complicated shapes and are an initial measure for handling complicated tasks. A metamorphic robots system could offer a higher degree of reliability and robustness compared to fixed-architecture robots due to its capacity to self-repair: should some modules fail and no longer move, the shape could be reconstructed by the non-faulty modules. To do this correctly, efficiently, and without restricting the autonomy of the modules is a non-trivial task. In this paper, we study the Line Recoveryproblem, requiring the non-faulty modules to reconstruct the line without violation of connectivity requirements at any time during the recovery procedure.

10.1109/ICBDSE65491.2025.11220132,SC-DVHT: Spectrum-Constrained MARL for Dynamic Vehicle Control in Heterogeneous Traffic,"In dense heterogeneous traffic scenarios, the co-evolution of long-term strategic planning and instantaneous behavioral responses in driving patterns exhibits strong coupling dynamics, leading to substantial uncertainties in intention inference and trajectory prediction (e.g., frequent lane-changing behaviors may stem from transient road anomalies or persistent driving habits). Conventional autonomous driving approaches struggle to address these challenges due to inherent limitations in pattern disambiguation, computational efficiency, and temporal modeling. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes SC-DVHT (Spectral-Constraint Dynamic Vehicle Heterogeneous Traffic framework), which establishes a dynamic spectral-spatiotemporal joint modeling architecture for effective decoupling of multi-scale driving characteristics:(1)The dynamic spectral-constraint mechanism confines behavioral cycles to physically interpretable from 3 to $T / 2$ intervals to suppress both high-frequency noise artifacts and low-frequency pseudo-periodic disturbances;(2)Asymmetric convolutional kernel assemblies coupled with sparse attention gating mechanisms collaboratively extract micro-scale maneuvers (e.g., steering angles) and macro-scale tactical patterns (e.g., overtaking frequencies);(3)Multi-granularity contextual modeling integrates second-level instantaneous behaviors with minute-level strategic evolution, enabling holistic intention reasoning that “captures both granular details and global patterns”.Experimental results demonstrate that in heterogeneous highway environments, TemporalNet outperforms the Decentralized Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) MARL algorithm (iPLAN) by $11.7 \%$ in survival duration and $9.1 \%$ in success rate under moderate traffic conditions. When benchmarked against QMIX - the widelyused CTDE (Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution) framework in multi-agent reinforcement learning - the proposed method demonstrates superior performance in moderate traffic conditions, exhibiting a $1.37 \%$ extension in operational duration, $13.27 \%$ enhancement in mission completion efficiency, and $7.72 \%$ improvement in motion continuity maintenance. Notably, in chaotic traffic scenarios, SC-DVHT exhibits $0.8 \%$ and $7.4 \%$ improvements in survival time and success rate over iPLAN, respectively. These findings confirm that spectral-spatiotemporal joint modeling significantly enhances robustness of intention perception in complex traffic environments, establishing a novel paradigm for high-density dynamic driving decisionmaking systems.",TOPIC

Since the data generation states of LEO satellites are hybrid constant and stochastic, the MEO satellites could allocate channels more timely than the ground mission center, and the action space for channel allocation is too large, the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning based algorithm is consequently adopted to solve the channel allocation problem.

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has emerged as a key technology to improve spectral efficiency (SE) by allowing multiple IoT devices (IDs) to share the same frequency resource block through power-domain multiplexing. However, as the number of IDs increases, NOMA faces significant interference challenges, which limit its scalability and degrade system performance. To address these limitations, we propose a clustered NOMA (C-NOMA) framework, which organizes IDs into clusters and applies NOMA within each cluster, reducing interference and improving the effectiveness of successive interference cancellation (SIC). Additionally, we integrate hybrid beamforming (HBF) with C-NOMA, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serve as mobile base stations using 2D uniform planar array (UPA) antennas for beam steering. This enables multiple IDs to be served within each cluster with fewer RF chains, further enhancing SE through spatial multiplexing and beam steering. In order to solve the energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem, we reformulate the optimization problem of HBF and power allocation (PA) as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve it using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

The brain activity is solely used to generate commands that can be recognized by the computer. To generate a recognizable brain activity, usually the subject imagines the movements of one's limbs without performing any real movement. In the literature, this paradigm is called Motor Imagery (MI). The subject provides data through a particular recording technology, such as EEG, in a certain time frame, in which the subject forces himself/herself into the feeling of performing a particular action. Each recorded data is linked to a label, and different techniques are used to learn patterns, in order to map them correctly. The goal of this paper is to investigate, whether it is possible to generate similar results as in the case of imagining the movement of limbs, by imagining the movement of an external object. To investigate this, we compare the performance of Motor Imagery and Object Motor Imagery. In the first case the mental task consists of imagining the movements of arms, while in the second the imagining of moving an external box through solely brain activity. A video of a box that moves through a plane in two directions, right, left, is used as visual feedback in both cases. The recorded EEG data are split into training and testing subsets, and are fed to a deep neural network, that tries to learn the different patterns and to classify them. The results show that Object Motor Imagery can achieve better results compared to MI, despite the lack of embodiment and congruity with any daily neural command. The trained architecture is used to control a mobile humanoid, investigating the implementation of Object Motor Movement in robotic application.",TOPIC

It aims to address three major technical bottlenecks commonly faced by traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches in path planning applications: the challenge of non-stationarity caused by dynamic environments, the difficulty of coordinated policy optimization among agents, and the inefficiency of the training process. By systematically analyzing the core features of the MADDPG algorithm-such as its distinctive centralized training with decentralized execution framework, gradient variance suppression mechanism, and adaptability to diverse scenarios-this research establishes two key optimization pathways. In terms of technological innovation, the study achieves dual breakthroughs. First, by incorporating the LSTM neural network architecture, it significantly enhances agents' ability to capture temporal dynamics, enabling a more accurate understanding of environmental evolution. Second, it introduces a progressive curriculum learning paradigm, implementing a staged task difficulty strategy that effectively refines the agents' learning trajectory. Empirical results demonstrate that the optimized algorithm exhibits outstanding performance in multi-agent path planning tasks. A high-fidelity simulation testbed with three heterogeneous agents was developed, and extensive comparative experiments confirmed the superiority of the proposed method. Experimental data show notable improvements across several key performance metrics: the task planning success rate increased to 95.12%, the average path length was reduced by 0.8 meters compared to baseline methods, and the average navigation time was shortened to 10.4 seconds-all significantly outperforming existing approaches. To further validate the algorithm's performance, the research team conducted a quantitative analysis using agent position heatmaps, which vividly illustrated the enhanced rationality of path planning and the improved environmental adaptability offered by the proposed algorithm.",TOPIC

Tomatoes, being predominantly selfpollinated, depend on airflow to transfer pollen from the anther to the stigma within the flower. In isolated environments like greenhouses, ensuring effective air pollination presents a significant challenge. Due to limited natural airflow, greenhouses often rely on mechanical ventilation systems which cannot adequately replicate the natural pollination process. In this work, a low-cost but efficient autonomous pollination system is developed for tomato plants in greenhouses that utilize both deep learning capability as well as robotic hardware manipulation. The deep learning model is based on the YOLOv8 Nano architecture that is customized with a transformer module which achieved an mAP@50 score of $\mathbf{9 4. 6}$ percent for mature flower detection. Explainable AI (XAI) like EigenCAM and XGrad-CAM approach showed correct visualization over the flower area with minimum noise. The developed model was implemented on the Nvidia Jetson Nano where the Bot-SORT tracking algorithm was used to avoid over-pollination of the same flower. For real-time application, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) app was developed which functioned together with the hardware system using closed-loop feedback control on a pan-tilt mechanism for targeting each mature tomato flower. This technique ensured consistent pollination throughout the day and offers efficiency, precision, and cost-effectiveness by increasing yield.",TOPIC

A soft robot, inspired by the locomotion mechanisms of the earthworm and the inchworm, is proposed here, which consists of three components: a telescopic torso, flexible necks, and adhesive feet. The telescopic torso enables peristaltic wave transmission through axial deformation, while the flexible necks enable dexterous posture adjustment via large-angle deformation capabilities, complemented by adhesive feet providing anchoring characteristics. Modular pneumatic control facilitates adaptive switching between earthworm crawling mode (crawling speed: 0.11 BL/s, steering speed:13.1°/s) and inchworm crawling mode (crawling speed: 0.072 BL/s). Moreover, by combining its earthworm and inchworm modes, the soft robot can stably climb slopes up to 15 degrees.

Accurate vessel segmentation from medical images is crucial for robotic navigation, path planning, and intraoperative risk assessment. However, vessel segmentation remains challenging due to low contrast, fine-scale structures, and complex vascular morphology. To address these challenges, a novel dual-branch convolutional module (DBCM) is proposed. The DBCM combines standard convolutions and depthwise separable convolutions in parallel, followed by a Coordinate Attention mechanism and a residual connection. The upper branch captures semantic features, while the lower branch enhances computational efficiency and local feature representation. This hybrid design allows the model to effectively capture both global and local features, improving segmentation accuracy. The residual connection ensures stable gradient flow, while the low computational cost makes the approach suitable for real-time robotic-assisted vascular interventions. The method was evaluated on the DRIVE and CHASE_DB1 datasets, with experimental results demonstrating superior performance in Acc (0.9653), F1-score (0.8156), and IoU (0.6886), compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining a lightweight architecture suitable for real-time clinical applications.",TOPIC

We consider a feature as several local surfaces that have the same kinds of characteristics. A standard geometry can be defined by attributes abstracted from a set of features. For the regular geometry of the same category, descriptions and topological relations about these objects’ features are known before modeling tasks. In order to maximize the acquisition of an object’s surface in a few views, knowledge of its features is employed as partial prior information that guides the view planning in active reconstruction. Since each reconstruction task may have a different type of object to be rebuilt, in order to make the view planning algorithm suitable for different tasks, we store the prior information of the object in a fixed-form database, so as to call the content of the library to perform verification and reasoning of all features, and make predictions on unknown local surface and rough shape of the object. The predicted unknown surface is discretized and then marked as predicted voxels in the voxel space, which are used to evaluate the priority of all candidate viewpoints, together with the detected voxels. A novel hybrid optimization function is proposed that takes the constraint on overlap, the accessibility of predicted surface, and the amount of unknown object surface into account. Simulated experiments are conducted and the results show that our method is efficient for reconstruction.",TOPIC

We proposed a dual-motor coupled joint actuator aiming for better kinematics performance, fast dynamic response, and high power density. Two motors were placed at the upper and lower module of the joint actuator, and their power was coupled by a planetary reducer. The speed differential of two motors determined the joint actuator’s rotation states: speed, direction, and stop. 3D simulation shows that this new design could smoothly change motion with a 360-degree rotation range and fast dynamic response, successfully satisfying project expectations and demonstrating its usability.

In recent years, the growth of renewable energy sources (RES) has been greatly accelerated thanks to the privatization and deregulation of the energy industry, as well as financial incentives and energy policy measures. As decentralized energy generation is developed through residential and commercial PV applications, a new position described as an energy prosumer is produced. The traditional division between energy users and producers is eliminated as a result. Blockchain technology automate direct energy transactions inside a distributed system architecture based on consensus-based verification and cryptographic hashing, providing utilities, prosumers, and consumers with a one-of-a-kind, cost-effective, and secure energy-trading system. The objective of this project is to implement a general ABM simulation framework for energy exchange and demonstrate the operation of any blockchain process as well as the expected power profiles of homes. A robust multi-agent structure was constructed and simulated for a Transactive Energy (TE) type Distributed Energy Resources (DER) within the ECCH microgrid that is dependent on blockchain engineering. Auction systems are used in recent blockchain-based LEM plans to balance supply and demand in the future. These blockchain-based LEMs rely on accurate short-term forecasts of the energy generation and consumption of particular homes as a consequence. Such accurate estimations are usually only assumed. In the present study, this assumption was tested by first evaluating the forecast accuracy that can be obtained for particular families using state-of-the-art energy forecasting methods, and then by examining the effects of prediction mistakes on market outcomes in three alternative supply scenarios. The evaluation showed that an LSTM model may provide rather little predicting errors. The prediction process will be modified to fit the design of a blockchain-based LEM. Because of this, the current study differs greatly from past investigations that make a thorough effort to predict the time sequence of smart meters generally.",TOPIC

However, the reliance on large datasets and neural networks presents challenges such as high-power consumption and limited adaptability, particularly in SWaP-constrained applications like planetary exploration. To address these issues, we propose enhancing the autonomous capabilities of intelligent robots by emulating the associative learning observed in animals. Associative learning enables animals to adapt to their environment by memorizing concurrent events. By replicating this mechanism, neuromorphic robots can navigate dynamic environments autonomously, learning from interactions to optimize performance. This paper explores the emulation of associative learning in rodents using neuromorphic robots within open-field maze environments, leveraging insights from spatial cells such as place and grid cells.

Prior work mainly focused on performance without examining cerebral cortical dynamics via brain biomarkers to assess the level of practice during the learning of such assistive devices. Specifically, it was suggested that EEG biomarkers like low- and high-beta spectral power are related to learning as they assess memory formation and attentional mechanisms. Therefore, this work examines how sensorimotor performance, and low-/high-beta spectral power are influenced as individuals without disabilities practice reaching movements with a simulated robotic effector executed via a head-controlled interface. Results revealed faster and straighter reaching movements. Additionally, as individuals progressed from early to late practice, the movement planning stage revealed an elevation of frontal, central and parietal low-beta power and an attenuation of high-beta power in the temporal region. These spectral modulations may reflect an internal model memory encoding process of the novel sensorimotor mapping imposed by this interface throughout practice which ultimately enables improved reaching performance. This work could inform patients' cognitive-motor processes when learning to control assistive systems and provide biomarkers for monitoring practice during rehabilitation.",TOPIC

One of the reasons is the actuator's ability to infer the applied torque by measuring the deflection of the elastic element as opposed to directly with dedicated torque sensors. Proper deflection control is pinnacle to achieve a desired output torque and, therefore, small deviances in positional measurements or a nonlinear deformation can have adverse effects on performance. In applications with larger torque requirements, the actuators typically use gear reductions which inherently result in mechanical backlash. This combined with the nonlinear behaviour of the elastic element and unmodelled dynamics, can severely compromise force fidelity.This paper proposes a backlash compensating active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) for multi-input series elastic actuators. In addition to proper deflection control, a multiinput active disturbance rejection controller is derived and implemented experimentally to mitigate any unmodelled nonlinearities or perturbations to the plant model. The controller is experimentally validated on a hybrid motor-brake-clutch series elastic actuator and the controller performance is compared against traditional error-based controllers. It is shown that the backlash compensated ADRC outperforms classical PID and ADRC methods and is a viable solution to positional measurement error in elastic actuators.",TOPIC

Various processes in this field can benefit from the proper use of state of the art technology [1], in terms of efficiency as well as quality. One of these areas is the harvesting of ripe fruit.In order to be able to automate this process, a robotic harvester needs to be aware of the full poses of the crop/fruit to be collected in order to perform proper path- and collision-planning. The current state of the art mainly considers problems of detection and segmentation of fruit with localisation limited to the 3D position only. The reliable and real-time estimation of the respective orientations remains a mostly unaddressed problem.In this paper, we present a compact and efficient network architecture for estimating the orientation of soft fruit such as strawberries from colour and, optionally, depth images. The proposed system can be automatically trained in a realistic simulation environment. We evaluate the system’s performance on simulated datasets and validate its operation on publicly available images of strawberries to demonstrate its practical use. Depending on the amount of training data used, coverage of state space, as well as the availability of RGB-D or RGB data only, mean errors of as low as 11° could be achieved.",TOPIC

This work proposes a novel telemanipulation architecture using a passive Fractal Impedance Controller (FIC), which does not depend upon an active viscous component for guaranteeing stability. Compared to a traditional impedance controller in ideal conditions (no delays and maximum communication bandwidth), our proposed method yields higher transparency in interaction and demonstrates superior dexterity and capability in our telemanipulation test scenarios. We also validate its performance with extreme delays up to 1 s and communication bandwidths as low as 10 Hz. All results validate a consistent stability when using the proposed controller in challenging conditions, regardless of operator expertise.",TOPIC

Leveraging the massive computing power of the cloud and low-latency connectivity to the edge can compensate for this lack of computing resources. However, this introduces a new challenge related to the deployment of complex robotic software across multiple devices, especially in a large-scale system. This paper presents KubeROS, a unified and fully managed platform for automated deployment of robotic applications developed on top of Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2), in a hybrid computing infrastructure with robots, edge and cloud. KubeROS uses Kubernetes from Cloud Native Computing as its underlying software orchestration framework. It aims to help researchers and developers with no prior cloud computing knowledge deploy their ROS2-based robotic applications at any scale. KubeROS eliminates the need for system configuration and network setup. We demonstrate the applicability of KubeROS by deploying a fleet of simulated mobile manipulators in a clas-sical pick-and-place application. The experiments demonstrate the effects of different deployment strategies for vision-based motion planning under different fleet sizes and workloads. In addition, KubeROS improves task performance by using high-performance computing at the edge and in the cloud, and achieves high resource efficiency when using the shared deployment strategy.",TOPIC

While many efforts focus on generating collision-free reference signals, few allow safe contact between the robot bodies and the environment. However, in human's daily manipulation, contact between arms and obstacles is prevalent and even necessary. This paper investigates the benefit of allowing safe contact during robotic manipulation and advocates generating and tracking compliance reference signals in both operational and null spaces. In addition, to optimize the collision-allowed trajectories, we present a hybrid solver that integrates sampling- and gradient-based approaches. We evaluate the proposed method on a goal-reaching task in five simulated and real-world environments with different collisional conditions. We show that allowing safe contact improves goal-reaching efficiency and provides feasible solutions in highly collisional scenarios where collision-free constraints cannot be enforced. Moreover, we demonstrate that planning in null space, in addition to operational space, improves trajectory safety.

When the problem is over-constrained or infeasible, a fundamental issue is to detect a minimal subset of variables and constraints that are infeasible. Previous approaches require solving several nonlinear programs, incrementally adding and removing constraints, and are thus computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a graph neural architecture that predicts which variables and constraints are jointly infeasible. The model is trained with a dataset of labeled subgraphs of Factored-NLPs, and importantly, can make useful predictions on larger factored nonlinear programs than the ones seen during training. We evaluate our approach in robotic manipulation planning, where our model is able to generalize to longer manipulation sequences involving more objects and robots, and different geometric environments. The experiments show that the learned model accelerates general algorithms for conflict extraction (by a factor of 50) and heuristic algorithms that exploit expert knowledge (by a factor of 4).",TOPIC

More recently, beyond waypoint planning, problems involving significant components of (visual) high-level reasoning have been explored in simulated environments, mostly addressed with large-scale machine learning, in particular RL, offline-RL or imitation learning. These methods require the agent to learn various skills like local planning, mapping objects and querying the learned spatial representations. In contrast to simpler tasks like waypoint planning (PointGoal), for these more complex tasks the current state-of-the-art models have been thoroughly evaluated in simulation but, to our best knowledge, not yet in real environments. In this work we focus on sim2real transfer. We target the challenging Multi-Object Navigation (Multi-ON) task [41] and port it to a physical environment containing real replicas of the originally virtual Multi-ON objects. We introduce a hybrid navigation method, which decomposes the problem into two different skills: (1) waypoint navigation is addressed with classical SLAM combined with a symbolic planner, whereas (2) exploration, semantic mapping and goal retrieval are dealt with deep neural networks trained with a combination of supervised learning and RL. We show the advantages of this approach compared to end-to-end methods both in simulation and a real environment and outperform the SOTA for this task [28]. © 2023 IEEE.",TOPIC

The idea of replacing the actual environment with a learned simulator has also been explored in model-based reinforcement learning in the context of world models. In this work, we show data-driven traffic simulation can be formulated as a world model. We present TrafficBots, a multi-agent policy built upon motion prediction and end-to-end driving, and based on TrafficBots we obtain a world model tailored for the planning module of autonomous vehicles. Existing data-driven traffic simulators are lacking configurability and scalability. To generate configurable behaviors, for each agent we introduce a destination as nav-igational information, and a time-invariant latent personality that specifies the behavioral style. To improve the scalability, we present a new scheme of positional encoding for angles, allowing all agents to share the same vectorized context and the use of an architecture based on dot-product attention. As a result, we can simulate all traffic participants seen in dense urban scenarios. Experiments on the Waymo open motion dataset show TrafficBots can simulate realistic multi-agent behaviors and achieve good performance on the motion prediction task.",TOPIC

However, layout estimation using point clouds (PCs) still suffers from data scarcity due to annotation difficulty. As such, we address the semi-supervised setting of this task based upon the idea of model exponential moving averaging. But adapting this scheme to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solution for PC-based layout estimation is not straightforward. To this end, we define a quad set matching strategy and several consistency losses based upon metrics tailored for layout quads. Besides, we propose a new online pseudo-label harvesting algorithm that decomposes the distribution of a hybrid distance measure between quads and PC into two components. This technique does not need manual threshold selection and intuitively encourages quads to align with reliable layout points. Surprisingly, this framework also works for the fully-supervised setting, achieving a new SOTA on the ScanNet benchmark. Last but not least, we also push the semi-supervised setting to the realistic omni-supervised setting, demonstrating significantly promoted performance on a newly annotated ARKitScenes testing set.

We first generate over 650K cluttered scenes-orders of magnitude more than prior work-in diverse everyday environments, such as cabinets and shelves. We render synthetic partial point clouds from this data and use it to train our CabiNet model architecture. CabiNet is a collision model that accepts object and scene point clouds, captured from a single-view depth observation, and predicts collisions for SE(3) object poses in the scene. Our representation has a fast inference speed of 7μs/query with nearly 20% higher performance than baseline approaches in challenging environments. We use this collision model in conjunction with a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) planner to generate collision-free trajectories for picking and placing in clutter. CabiNet also predicts waypoints, computed from the scene's signed distance field (SDF), that allows the robot to navigate tight spaces during rearrangement. This improves rearrangement performance by nearly 35% compared to baselines. We systematically evaluate our approach, procedurally generate simulated experiments, and demonstrate that our approach directly transfers to the real world, despite training exclusively in simulation.

Given the complex, non-linear, anisotropic material properties of the mushrooms in combination with the multiple failure-mode modalities involved, we design a simulation framework around the PyBullet rigid-body-physics engine by utilizing first-order approximations of the equivalent continuum mechanics models. By exploiting the computational efficiency of the aforementioned simulation framework, we directly apply the MPPI control framework to generate offline optimal mushroom uprooting motion primitives, defining a set of cost objectives for an optimal and within-constraint harvesting plan. We show that with this planning strategy, the “root-bending” action emerges autonomously for the case of a single mushroom as an optimal uprooting maneuver, which corresponds well to empirical knowledge obtained by expert pickers.

These planned trajectories must be both kinematically feasible (i.e., collision free) and dynamically feasible (i.e., satisfy the underlying system dynamics), necessitating a consideration of both the free space and the dynamics of the robot in the path planning phase. In this work, we explore the application of reachable Bézier polytopes as an efficient tool for generating trajectories satisfying both kinematic and dynamic requirements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by offloading specific computation tasks to the GPU, such an algorithm can meet tight real time requirements. We propose a layered control architecture that efficiently produces collision free and dynamically feasible paths for nonlinear control systems, and demonstrate the framework on the tasks of 3D hopping in a cluttered environment.",TOPIC

This paper addresses the challenge of planning Passenger robot movements, framing it as a Stochastic Multi-Agent Orienteering Problem (SMOP) complicated by factors like stochastic operational efforts and disruptive events. We optimize the task completion efficiency of the system by combining centralized solutions from the Mothership with local plans from Passengers to enhance system resilience. Our contributions include defining the SMOP, developing a solution using Decentralized Monte Carlo Tree Search, presenting a hybrid algorithm that integrates centralized plans into the distributed framework, and evaluating the algorithm's performance in a simulated environment.

This task requires complex reasoning, such as determining whether it is possible to turn left into a specific lane. To address this challenge, we introduce neuro-symbolic methods powered by vision-language foundation models (VLMs). Existing approaches have notable limitations: (1) Dense visual prompting with VLMs can achieve strong performance but is costly in terms of both financial resources and carbon footprint, making it impractical for robotics applications. (2) Neuro-symbolic reasoning methods for 3D scene understanding fail to integrate visual inputs when synthesizing programs, making them ineffective in handling complex corner cases. To this end, we propose a fast-slow neuro-symbolic lane topology extraction algorithm, named Chameleon, which alternates between a fast system that directly reasons over detected instances using synthesized programs and a slow system that utilizes a VLM with a chain-of-thought design to handle corner cases. Chameleon leverages the strengths of both approaches, providing an affordable solution while maintaining high performance.

As a vehicle navigates at the limit of its capabilities over extreme terrain, its dynamics can change suddenly and dramatically. For example, varying terrain can affect parameters such as traction, tire slip, and rolling resistance. To achieve effective planning in such environments, it is crucial to have a dynamics model that can accurately anticipate these conditions and respond before an issue can occur. In this work, we present a hybrid model that predicts the changing dynamics induced by the terrain as a function of visual inputs. We leverage a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) DINOv2, which provides rich features that encodes fine-grained semantic information. To use this dynamics model for planning, we propose an end-to-end training architecture for a projection distance independent feature encoder that compresses the information from the VFM, enabling the creation of a lightweight map of the environment at runtime.

Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound reconstruction and new view image synthesis, which can assist in diagnosis and reexamine, have significant potential in teleultrasound, especially integrating robotic ultrasound systems (RUSS). Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), an impressive reconstruction method, requires long training times, limiting its practicality in ultrasound. Despite NeRF variants achieving faster optimization, their performance remains confined to natural scene reconstructions. To address this limitation, we propose HFUS-NeRF, a hybrid representation method designed for fast and accurate ultrasound reconstruction. HFUS-NeRF integrates multi-resolution hash-grid and tri-plane representations to represent each sampling point of the ultrasonic wave. A unified model for sampling points from different ultrasonic probes is presented to simulate the wave's propagation through tissues, and the final ultrasound image is rendered using volume rendering. Compared with NeRF-based ultrasound reconstruction, both the hash grid and triplane resolutions can be scaled up more efficiently, improving reconstruction speed. Experimental results demonstrate that HFUS-NeRF enhances reconstruction quality while significantly reducing reconstruction time to mere minutes. Furthermore, we validated HFUS-NeRF's adaptability by reconstruction using images from different types of ultrasound probes, and real-world experiments confirmed its feasibility and transferability, enabling fast ultrasound reconstruction on human subjects.",TOPIC

Indeed, the stochastic nature of the underlying environment dynamics makes it an interesting research field for statistical learning approaches and neural policies. In this work, we introduce a novel attention-based neural architecture capable of solving a smoothing task for such objects by means of a single robotic arm. To train our network, we leverage an oracle policy, executed in simulation, which uses the topological description of a mesh of points for representing the object to smooth. In a second step, we transfer the resulting behavior in the real world with imitation learning using the cloth point cloud as decision support, which is captured from a single RGBD camera placed egocentrically on the wrist of the arm. This approach allows fast training of the real-world manipulation neural policy while not requiring scene reconstruction at test time, but solely a point cloud acquired from a single RGBD camera. Our resulting policy first predicts the desired point to choose from the given point cloud and then the correct displacement to achieve a smoothed cloth. Experimentally, we first assess our results in a simulation environment by comparing them with an existing heuristic policy, as well as several baseline attention architectures. Then, we validate the performance of our approach in a real-world scenario. Project website: link",TOPIC

Building on the foundation of Fractal Impedance Control (FIC) introduced in our previous work, this paper presents a novel extension to dualarm tele-cooperation, leveraging the non-linear stiffness and passivity of FIC to adapt to diverse cooperative scenarios. Unlike traditional impedance controllers, our approach ensures stability without relying on energy tanks, as demonstrated in our prior research.

In this work, these global tibia kinematics define a phase variable impedance controller (PVIC), which is implemented as the nonvolitional base controller within a hybrid volitional control framework (PVI-HVC). The gait progression estimation and biomechanic performance of one able-bodied individual walking on a robotic ankle prosthesis via a bypass adapter are compared for three control schemes: benchmark passive controller, PVIC, and PVI-HVC. The different actuation of each had a direct effect on the global tibia kinematics, but the average deviation between the estimated and ground truth gait percentages were 1.6%, 1.8%, and 2.1%, respectively, for each controller. Both PVIC and PVI-HVC produced good agreement with able-bodied kinematic and kinetic references. As designed, PVI-HVC results were similar to those of PVIC when the user used low volitional intent, but yielded higher peak plantarflexion, peak torque, and peak power when the user commanded high volitional input in late stance. This additional torque and power also allowed the user to volitionally and continuously achieve activities beyond level walking, such as ascending ramps, avoiding obstacles, standing on tip-toes, and tapping the foot. In this way, PVI-HVC offers the kinetic and kinematic performance of the PVIC during level ground walking, along with the freedom to volitionally pursue alternative activities.",TOPIC

However, this approach poses a significant challenge when attempting to modify or adjust the loads within a single training set. This paper introduces an innovative method for achieving adjustable loads during resistance training by leveraging physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI). The primary objective is to regulate targeted muscle activation through the use of Robo-Coach (robotic coach system). We first utilize a Task-Parameterized Gaussian Mixture Model (TP-GMM) to learn the motion of coach demonstration, which can be generalized for the trainees. The 3D path extracted from the generated trajectory is then projected onto a 2D plane with respect to the direction of the load. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid stiffness/position generator for online task execution. This generator determines the desired positions in the 2D plane according to the contact point displacements in the stimuli direction and, simultaneously, sets the desired stiffness based on the muscle activation feedback.

Existing learning-based MAPF approaches typically only let each agent make decisions based on a limited field-of-view (FOV) around its position, as a natural means to fix the input dimensions of its policy network. However, this often makes policies shortsighted, since agents lack the ability to perceive and plan for obstacles/agents beyond their FOV. To address this challenge, we propose ALPHA, a new framework combining the use of ground truth proximal (local) information and fuzzy distal (global) information to let agents sequence local decisions based on the full current state of the system, and avoid such myopicity. We further allow agents to make short-term predictions about each others’ paths, as a means to reason about each others’ path intentions, thereby enhancing the level of cooperation among agents at the whole system level. Our neural structure relies on a Graph Transformer architecture to allow agents to selectively combine these different sources of information and reason about their inter-dependencies at different spatial scales. Our simulation experiments demonstrate that ALPHA outperforms both globally-guided MAPF solvers and communication-learning based ones, showcasing its potential towards scalability in realistic deployments.",TOPIC

One class of cognitive bias deals with the ordering of items or interactions: information presented last among a grouping is most salient in memory formation (recency bias), followed by information presented first (primacy bias), followed by information in the middle, collectively known as the serial-position effect. For example, if a human’s last observation of a robot involves a task failure, this will disproportionately negatively alter their perception of the robot’s competence, as well as their trust in the robot moving forward. It is valuable to characterize the effect of these biases within human-robot interactions to inform strategies for risk-aware planning that cultivate appropriate levels of human trust. We conducted a human-subjects study (n=53) testing the influence of the serial-position effect on recalled competence (see overview at https://youtu.be/BgH2zhh1s48). Participants viewed videos of a robot performing the same tasks at the same level of competence, with task order differing by experimental condition (rising competence, falling competence, or failures at the midpoint), asking participants to rate robot competence in between every video as well at the very end of the experiment. We found that while the average between-video rating of robot competence remained stable across conditions, the recalled, post-experiment ratings of competence and trust were significantly lower in the condition with decreasing competence than in either of the other two conditions, suggesting a notable recency bias. We conclude with implications for human-subjects experiment design (i.e., how subjective measures are influenced by ordering effects) and provide design recommendations to minimize them. We further discuss practical applications of these results in creating risk-aware robotic planners capable of trust calibration.",TOPIC

In the domain of assistive robotics, we seek instead to utilise the user’s cognitive abilities for enhanced satisfaction, grasping performance, and alignment with their high level task-specific goals. Given a pair of stereo images, we perform unknown object instance segmentation and generate a 3D reconstruction of the object of interest. In shared control, the user then guides the robot end-effector across a virtual hemisphere centered around the object to their desired approach direction. A physics-based grasp planner finds the most stable local grasp on the reconstruction, and finally the user is guided by shared control to this grasp. In experiments on the DLR EDAN platform, we report a grasp success rate of 87% for 10 unknown objects, and demonstrate the method’s capability to grasp objects in structured clutter and from shelves.",TOPIC

Recent efforts have attempted to address these challenges via data-driven methods, learning dynamical models in combination with model predictive control. Those methods, while effective, rely solely on minimizing forward prediction errors to hope for better task performance with MPC controllers. This weak correlation can result in data inefficiency as well as limitations to overall performance. In response, we propose a novel strategy: using a policy gradient algorithm to find a simplified dynamics model that explicitly maximizes task performance. Specifically, we parameterize the stochastic policy as the perturbed output of the MPC controller, thus, the learned model representation can directly associate with the policy or task performance. We apply the proposed method to contact-rich tasks where a three-fingered robotic hand manipulates previously unknown objects. Our method significantly enhances task success rate by up to 15% in manipulating diverse objects compared to the existing method while sustaining data efficiency.

Gravity compensation is one of the most effective ways to optimize such mechanisms for better energy efficiency and for reducing the strain of the actuators involved. Spring-based gravity compensation can effectively reduce both the motor torque and energy consumption but is subjected to degradation over time and requires maintenance. Alternatively, counterweight compensation offers consistent performance but at the cost of higher structural loads on mechanical links. Most studies primarily focus on motor torques, often overlooking the joint reaction forces encountered along the manipulator's designed paths within the workspace.

Motor torques and joint forces are examined under three conditions: no compensation, spring compensation, and counterweight compensation. Theoretical models are verified by MSC Adams simulations, highlighting the importance of understanding joint forces to assess the internal stresses and loads on each link during operation.

10.1109/IJCNN55064.2022.9892101,Graph Neural Networks for Relational Inductive Bias in Vision-based Deep Reinforcement Learning of Robot Control,"State-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms predominantly learn a policy from either a numerical state vector or images. Both approaches generally do not take structural knowledge of the task into account, which is especially prevalent in robotic applications and can benefit learning if exploited. This work introduces a neural network architecture that combines relational inductive bias and visual feedback to learn an efficient position control policy for robotic manipulation. We derive a graph representation that models the physical structure of the manipulator and combines the robot's internal state with a low-dimensional description of the visual scene generated by an image encoding network. On this basis, a graph neural network trained with reinforcement learning predicts joint velocities to control the robot. We further introduce an asymmetric approach of training the image encoder separately from the policy using supervised learning. Experimental results demonstrate that, for a 2-DoF planar robot in a geometrically simplistic 2D environment, a learned representation of the visual scene can replace access to the explicit coordinates of the reaching target without compromising on the quality and sample efficiency of the policy. We further show the ability of the model to improve sample efficiency for a 6-DoF robot arm in a visually realistic 3D environment.",TOPIC

The EARL consists of one upper base and two robotic legs. The upper base is worn through a backpack around the upper body and the robotic legs are distributed around the lower body. In this paper, the research subject is the robotic legs of the EARL. In order to ensure that the human body can have better movements matching under the state of wearing the EARL, and realize efficient, flexible and stable coordinated movements, a planning algorithm of hybrid dual-mode gait includes walking and running for movements of the robotic legs is proposed. The gait planning is an important means and a foundation of the development and design of the robotic legs. The algorithm is set up according to the dynamic model of the EARL. The dynamic model is established by using the multi-level inverted pendulum with the joint deformation when the robotic legs hit the ground. The desired joint trajectories of the EARL are planned by the piecewise function and the gait cycle is determined by an experiment. Ultimately the prototype simulation is set up to verify the tracking performance of the EARL. The proposed validity is ensured by the simulation. The simulation results show the planned trajectories are continuous curves. The angular velocity of joints minus to 0 is to call for an end or to start another cycle. It can ensure the continuity and stability of the EARL. 6 sudden changes of each figure represent 6 selected gait phases. In a word, the robotic legs of the EARL can achieve efficient and stable moving by tracking the planned trajectories. The hybrid dual-mode gait planning algorithm is not only a supplement of the gait planning theory, but the improvement of the cooperative control strategy between the robotic legs and the wearer's legs as well.

Slip-resistant, robust gripping of disc-shaped material during remote manipulation is a challenge in material handling. In a nuclear fuel manufacturing lab, sensitive fuel materials (objects) are handled in the form of a disc (melt) that is pre-cast. Depending on the process treatment, the metal discs are categorized as delicate, hard or soft. The metal discs that were handled by the robotic system and used in the experiment have a diameter of 60mm, a thickness of 15mm, and a weight of 2.3 kg., It is crucial to take care of the paradigms like grip force, profile and perception of slide for job planning and management of a robot in a hazardous radioactive environment. A multi-sensory tactile array is designed indigenously and fabricated by utilising commercial sensors attached to the prototype gripper so as to make it an intelligent instrumented-jaw gripper. The custom-built tactile sensory system is made up of a) force sensing resistors (FSRs) in a specific array, b) a matrix of FSR in the centre, c) PVDF (Polyvinylidene Fluoride) sensors in the perimeter and d) infrared (IR) sensors placed in a predetermined architecture. The mounting of the customized gripper sensory system includes a 3x2-array of FSRs and other sensors, each having a spatial resolution of 5 mm and a sensing area of $15,000 mm^{2}$. While PVDF sensor is employed for dynamic contact point estimation, texture recognition is accomplished using high frequency response. An integrated form of proximity and ambient light sensor is utilised (mimicing distance sensor) to detect the presence of an object and improve gripper alignment during grasping. This sensor-instrumented processing was achieved through microcontroller-based programming and allied electronics, such as scanning the array & storing the data. LabView® was used to record the digital signals and analysis of time-spanned raw data. Calibration was carried out to ensure that the acquired data was repeatable and reliable. The paradigms of indigenous development of the integrated sensory system for the gripper as well as its calibration, dynamic features and response characteristics are discussed in this paper. The tactile matrix has a force range of 30N, a resolution of 0.3N and a sensitivity of 0.5V/N., The FSR sensors produced a nonlinear relationship at various force ranges and the hysteresis therein was found to vary with load range and frequency. At lower frequencies of 0.2 and 0.8 Hz, cycle drift was significant, with a maximum inaccuracy in force value of 0.5 N. The force measuring inaccuracy of normal force was less than 5% at sensitive places. Based on the repeated experimentation, the developed matrix sensor was entrusted to have nearly 95% accuracy rate in recognising different textures. The developed tactile sensor matrix was found to be robust and it has good reproducibility in parameters like contact force measurement, contact point estimate, slip detection and texture recognition, according to the experimental results. To not withstanding benefits the developed tactile sensor system was also comprehended with few on-job limitations, signaling run-time error conditions.",TOPIC

The linear feedback control mechanism is not sufficient to control vehicle maneuver with precision, thus it summons research of adaptive control approach. An adaptive control strategy is most often deployed to control system with unknown plant model or a system with minimal information. The objective of the proposed hybrid control strategy is to deal with non-linearity in the actuation system with minimum tuning effort. An iterative back-stepping mechanism is used to design model reference adaptive control to aid vehicle maneuver.

10.1109/IROS45743.2020.9340749,Learning Hybrid Object Kinematics for Efficient Hierarchical Planning Under Uncertainty,"Sudden changes in the dynamics of robotic tasks, such as contact with an object or the latching of a door, are often viewed as inconvenient discontinuities that make manipulation difficult. However, when these transitions are well-understood, they can be leveraged to reduce uncertainty or aid manipulation-for example, wiggling a screw to determine if it is fully inserted or not. Current model-free reinforcement learning approaches require large amounts of data to learn to leverage such dynamics, scale poorly as problem complexity grows, and do not transfer well to significantly different problems. By contrast, hierarchical POMDP planning-based methods scale well via plan decomposition, work well on novel problems, and directly consider uncertainty, but often rely on precise hand-specified models and task decompositions. To combine the advantages of these opposing paradigms, we propose a new method, MICAH, which given unsegmented data of an object's motion under applied actions, (1) detects changepoints in the object motion model using action-conditional inference, (2) estimates the individual local motion models with their parameters, and (3) converts them into a hybrid automaton that is compatible with hierarchical POMDP planning. We show that model learning under MICAH is more accurate and robust to noise than prior approaches. Further, we combine MICAH with a hierarchical POMDP planner to demonstrate that the learned models are rich enough to be used for performing manipulation tasks under uncertainty that require the objects to be used in novel ways not encountered during training.",TOPIC

Current methods typically perform inference through only one mode of perception such as human motion trajectory, and a single theoretical framework such as a learning-based or classical approach. In contrast, this paper studies prediction of human navigational intent using multimodal perception within a hybrid framework. Our framework consists of two modules: a) a learning-based prediction module to predict a human’s future goal position, and b) a classical control theory-inspired reconstruction module to reconstruct a possible future trajectory or a set of possible future positions using the predicted future goal position. For the prediction module, we propose an end-to-end LSTM-CNN hybrid neural network for predicting a human’s future position in the real world, given human motion, human body pose and head orientation. This visual information from an egocentric perspective is used to make predictions of a human’s future position in world space, essential for robotic navigation algorithms and planning.

The planning problem for exploration requires determining the best locations for future measurements that will enhance the fidelity of the map, for example, by reducing its total entropy. A widely-studied technique involves computing the Mutual Information (MI) between the current map and future measurements, and utilizing this MI metric to decide the locations for future measurements. However, computing MI for reasonably-sized maps is slow and power hungry, which has been a bottleneck towards fast and efficient robotic exploration. In this paper, we introduce a new hardware accelerator architecture for MI computation that features a low-latency, energy-efficient MI compute core and an optimized memory subsystem that provides sufficient bandwidth to keep the cores fully utilized. The core employs interleaving to counter the recursive algorithm, and workload balancing and numerical approximations to reduce latency and energy consumption.

For comparison, this particular FPGA implementation running on the Xilinx Zynq-7000 platform is two orders of magnitude faster and consumes three orders of magnitude less energy per MI map compute, when compared to a baseline GPU implementation running on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 platform.

A common solution is to use a layered control architecture, where the top layer uses a simplified model of system dynamics for trajectory generation, and the low layer ensures approximate tracking of this trajectory via feedback control. While such layered control architectures are standard and work well in practice, selecting the simplified model used for trajectory generation typically relies on engineering intuition and experience. In this paper, we propose an alternative data-driven approach to dynamicsaware trajectory generation. We show that a suitable augmented Lagrangian reformulation of a global nonlinear optimal control problem results in a layered decomposition of the overall problem into trajectory planning and feedback control layers. Crucially, the resulting trajectory optimization is dynamicsaware, in that, it is modified with a tracking penalty regularizer encoding the dynamic feasibility of the generated trajectory. We show that this tracking penalty regularizer can be learned from system rollouts for independently-designed low layer feedback control policies, and instantiate our framework in the context of a unicycle and a quadrotor control problem in simulation.

10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10341747,ITIRRT: A Decoupled Framework for the Integration of Machine Learning Into Path Planning,"Machine learning models have been successfully applied in many separate domains in the recent years. Yet, there is still a large disconnect with the path planning community mainly due to implementation difficulty. In this paper, we identify the issues and present a path planning framework that aims to ease the integration of machine learning models. The framework is divided into two phases: prediction and planning. During the prediction phase machine learning models are used to predict a path solution which, while not perfect, is enough to jump-start our proposed planner. The planning phase begins with the initialization of multiple independent tree data structures and, during execution, our planner merges the different trees until a path is found. Due to the architecture of our framework, the prediction and the planning phases are totally decoupled, resulting in a planner that treats the information given by the prediction model as a guess and not as a path to be corrected. This also allows our planner to maintain its probabilistic completeness. Our planner was evaluated on simulated environments and on a small robotic arm. We show that our planner can successfully leverage predicted paths to significantly improve the planning performances. We also demonstrate the flexibility of our framework by integrating multiple machine learning models of varying complexity.",TOPIC

The CAMETA framework consists of three components: a path planning layer generating potential path suggestions, a multi-agent ETA prediction layer predicting the arrival times for all agents based on the paths, and lastly, a path selection layer that calculates the accumulated cost and selects the best path. The novelty of the CAMETA framework lies in the heterogeneous map representation and the heterogeneous graph neural network architecture. As a result of the proposed novel structure, CAMETA improves the generalization capability compared to the state-of-the-art methods that rely on structured road infrastructure and historical data. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the multi-agent ETA prediction layer, with a mean average percentage error improvement of 29.5% and 44% when compared to a traditional path planning method (A *) which does not consider conflicts. The performance of the CAMETA framework shows significant improvements in terms of robustness to noise and conflicts as well as determining proficient routes compared to state-of-the-art multi-agent path planners.",TOPIC
10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10342010,Spatial Reasoning via Deep Vision Models for Robotic Sequential Manipulation,"In this paper, we propose using deep neural architectures (i.e., vision transformers and ResNet) as heuristics for sequential decision-making in robotic manipulation problems. This formulation enables predicting the subset of objects that are relevant for completing a task. Such problems are often addressed by task and motion planning (TAMP) formulations combining symbolic reasoning and continuous motion planning. In essence, the action-object relationships are resolved for discrete, symbolic decisions that are used to solve manipulation motions (e.g., via nonlinear trajectory optimization). However, solving long-horizon tasks requires consideration of all possible action-object combinations which limits the scalability of TAMP approaches. To overcome this combinatorial complexity, we introduce a visual perception module integrated with a TAMP-solver. Given a task and an initial image of the scene, the learned model outputs the relevancy of objects to accomplish the task. By incorporating the predictions of the model into a TAMP formulation as a heuristic, the size of the search space is significantly reduced. Results show that our framework finds feasible solutions more efficiently when compared to a state-of-the-art TAMP solver. © 2023 IEEE.",TOPIC

However, the expensive computing and storage associated with networks impose significant challenges for their deployment on low-cost robots. Motivated by this practical challenge, we develop a lightweight neural path planning architecture with a dual input network and a hybrid sampler for resource-constrained robotic systems. Our architecture is designed with efficient task feature extraction and fusion modules to translate the given planning instance into a guidance map. The hybrid sampler is then applied to restrict the planning within the prospective regions indicated by the guide map. To enable the network training, we further construct a publicly available dataset with various successful planning instances. Numerical simulations and physical experiments demonstrate that, compared with baseline approaches, our approach has nearly an order of magnitude fewer model size and five times lower computational while achieving promising performance. Besides, our approach can also accelerate the planning convergence process with fewer planning iterations compared to sample-based methods.",TOPIC
10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10342148,"Toward Closed-Loop Additive Manufacturing: Paradigm Shift in Fabrication, Inspection, and Repair","Increased usage of additive manufacturing (AM) in various industries has solidified its role as an advanced manufacturing technique. However, there is an inherent lack of reliability in AM processes, particularly common in extrusion or deposition-based methods due to the stochastic nature of ma-terial deposition. This necessitates an intelligent manufacturing solution to address the drawbacks of AM. Thus, we propose a novel layer-wise approach toward closed-loop AM, which is capable of in-situ monitoring and repairing geometric defects. In this paper, we present a system that uses a robotic AM experimental platform that mimics a conventional open-loop fabrication setup, which we augment into a closed-loop system using two add-ons: in-situ inspection subsystem and online process correction subsystem. The in-situ inspection subsystem collects 3D point cloud scans and compares them against a reference CAD model, categorizing geometric deviations as positive or negative defects. Then the subsequent online process correction subsystem uses a re-plan and/or repair strategy to address the positive and/or negative defects, respectively. To evaluate this idea, we conducted three experiments on parts with manually induced defects to investigate the system's ability to repair those parts, thereby reducing defects, improving part accuracy, and enhancing mechanical properties. Comparing the defective and repaired parts, we observe a reduction in defect percent by volume from 10.7% to 1.3%, an improvement in geometric tolerance from 3.86% error to 0.08% error, and an increase in the part's breaking load from 4.77 kN to 6.31 kN. These experiments prove that our layer-wise closed-loop additive manufacturing approach improves the quality, tolerance, and reliability of plastic 3D printed parts, with the potential to extend to other extrusion/deposition-based AM processes, or even subtractive manufacturing and hybrid manufacturing methods.",TOPIC
10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10342153,Hybrid Learning- and Model-Based Planning and Control of In-Hand Manipulation,"This paper presents a hierarchical framework for planning and control of in-hand manipulation of a rigid object involving grasp changes using fully-actuated multifin-gered robotic hands. While the framework can be applied to the general dexterous manipulation, we focus on a more complex definition of in-hand manipulation, where at the goal pose the hand has to reach a grasp suitable for using the object as a tool. The high level planner determines the object trajectory as well as the grasp changes, i.e. adding, removing, or sliding fingers, to be executed by the low-level controller. While the grasp sequence is planned online by a learning-based policy to adapt to variations, the trajectory planner and the low-level controller for object tracking and contact force control are exclusively model-based to robustly realize the plan. By infusing the knowledge about the physics of the problem and the low-level controller into the grasp planner, it learns to successfully generate grasps similar to those generated by model-based optimization approaches, obviating the high computation cost of online running of such methods to account for variations. By performing experiments in physics simulation for realistic tool use scenarios, we show the success of our method on different tool-use tasks and dexterous hand models. Additionally, we show that this hybrid method offers more robustness to trajectory and task variations compared to a model-based method.",TOPIC
10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10342308,Learning Whom to Trust in Navigation: Dynamically Switching Between Classical and Neural Planning,"Navigation of terrestrial robots is typically addressed either with localization and mapping (SLAM) followed by classical planning on the dynamically created maps, or by machine learning (ML), often through end-to-end training with reinforcement learning (RL) or imitation learning (IL). Recently, modular designs have achieved promising results, and hybrid algorithms that combine ML with classical planning have been proposed. Existing methods implement these combinations with handcrafted functions, which cannot fully exploit the complementary nature of the policies and the complex regularities between scene structure and planning performance. Our work builds on the hypothesis that the strengths and weaknesses of neural planners and classical planners follow some regularities, which can be learned from training data, in particular from interactions. This is grounded on the assumption that, both, trained planners and the mapping algorithms underlying classical planning are subject to failure cases depending on the semantics of the scene and that this dependence is learnable: for instance, certain areas, objects or scene structures can be reconstructed easier than others. We propose a hierarchical method composed of a high-level planner dynamically switching between a classical and a neural planner. We fully train all neural policies in simulation and evaluate the method in both simulation and real experiments with a LoCoBot robot, showing significant gains in performance, in particular in the real environment. We also qualitatively conjecture on the nature of data regularities exploited by the high-level planner. © 2023 IEEE.",TOPIC

Existing work for specifying these systems as a formal composition of contract algorithms has limited expressiveness compared to the variety of sophisticated architectures that are commonly used in practice. Therefore, in this paper, we (1) propose a novel metareasoning framework for formally composing robotic systems as a contract program with programming constructs for functional, conditional, and looping semantics and (2) introduce a recursive hill climbing algorithm that finds a locally optimal time allocation of a contract program. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline techniques in a simulated pick-and-place robot domain.",TOPIC

One of the main challenges in realizing such automation resides in efficiently finding solutions from a growing number of potential sequences for increasingly complex assemblies. Besides, costly feasibility checks are always required for the robotic system. To address this, we propose a holistic graphical approach including a graph representation called Assembly Graph for product assemblies and a policy architecture, Graph Assembly Processing Network, dubbed GRACE for assembly sequence generation. With GRACE, we are able to extract meaningful information from the graph input and predict assembly sequences in a step-by-step manner. In experiments, we show that our approach can predict feasible assembly sequences across product variants of aluminum profiles based on data collected in simulation of a dual-armed robotic system.

While deep-learning-based semantic segmentation approaches have reached outstanding performance in recent years, they demand large amounts of labeled data for training. Inspired by modern Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) techniques, in this paper, we introduce a two-step training pipeline specifically tailored to challenging natural scenes, where the availability of annotated data is often quite limited. Our strategy involves the initial training of a powerful domain adaptive architecture, followed by a refinement stage, where segmentation masks predicted by the Segment Anything Model (SAM) are used to improve the accuracy of the predictions on the target dataset. These refined predictions serve as pseudo-labels to supervise the training of a final distilled architecture for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments conducted in two real-world scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, we show that our pipeline enables the training of a MobileNetV3 that achieves significant mIoU gains of 3.60% and 11.40% on our two datasets compared to the DAFormer while only demanding 1/15 of the latter’s inference time.

10.1109/IROS58592.2024.10802094,Environment Transformer and Policy Optimization for Model-Based Offline Reinforcement Learning,"Interacting with the actual environment to acquire data is often costly and time-consuming in robotic tasks. Model-based offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a feasible solution. On the one hand, it eliminates the requirements of interaction with the actual environment. On the other hand, it learns the transition dynamics and reward function from the offline datasets and generates simulated rollouts to accelerate training. Previous model-based offline RL methods adopt probabilistic ensemble neural networks (NN) to model aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. However, this results in a great increase in training time and computing resource requirements. Furthermore, these methods are easily disturbed by the accumulative errors of the environment dynamics models when simulating long-term rollouts. To solve the above problems, we propose an uncertainty-aware sequence modeling architecture called Environment Transformer. It models the probability distribution of the environment dynamics and reward function to capture aleatoric uncertainty and treats epistemic uncertainty as a learnable noise parameter. Benefiting from the accurate modeling of the transition dynamics and reward function, Environment Transformer can be combined with arbitrary planning, dynamics programming, or policy optimization algorithms for offline RL. In this case, we perform Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) to learn a conservative Q-function. Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves or exceeds state-of-the-art performance in widely studied offline RL benchmarks. Moreover, we show that Environment Transformer's simulated rollout quality, sample efficiency, and long-term rollout simulation capability are superior to those of previous model-based offline RL methods.",TOPIC

The current pre-programmed disassembly conducted by the Autonomous Mobile Manipulator Robot(AMMR) struggles to meet the disassembly requirements in dynamic environments, complex scenarios, and unstructured processes. In this paper, we propose a Battery Disassembly AMMR(BEAM-1) system based on NeuralSymbolic AI. It detects the environmental state by leveraging a combination of multi-sensors and neural predicates and then translates this information into a quasi-symbolic space. In real-time, it identifies the optimal sequence of action primitives through LLM-heuristic tree search, ensuring high-precision execution of these primitives. Additionally, it employs positional speculative sampling using intuitive networks and achieves the disassembly of various bolt types with a meticulously designed end-effector.

Surgeons conventionally achieve this precision through intraoperative adjustments to the cutting plan, responding to deformations from tool-tissue interactions. This study examines the integration of physics-based tissue cutting simulations into autonomous robotic surgery to preoperatively predict and compensate for such deformations, aiming to improve surgical precision and reduce the necessity for dynamic adjustments during autonomous surgeries. This study adapts a real-to-sim-to-real workflow. Initially, the Autonomous System for Tumor Resection (ASTR) was employed to evaluate its accuracy in performing preoperatively intended incisions along the irregular contours of porcine tongue pseudotumors. Following this, a finite element analysis-based simulation, utilizing the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA), was developed and tuned to accurately mimic these tissue and incision interactions. Insights gained from this simulation were applied to refine the robot’s path planning, ensuring a closer alignment of actual incisions with the initially intended surgical plan. The efficacy of this approach was validated by comparing surface incision precision on ex vivo porcine tongues, with the average absolute error reducing from 1.73mm to 1.46mm after applying simulation-driven path adjustments (p < 0.001). Additionally, our method not only demonstrated improvements in maintaining the intended cutting shapes and locations, with shape matching scores using Hu moments enhancing from 0.10 to 0.06 and centroid shifts decreasing from 2.09mm to 1.33mm, but it also potentially reduced the likelihood of adverse oncologic outcomes by preventing clinically suggested excessively close margins of 2.2mm. This feasibility study suggests that merging physics-based cutting simulations with autonomous robotic surgery could potentially lead to more accurate incisions.",TOPIC

However, the existing tracking approaches, such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), do not adapt well to environmental changes and boundary conditions despite extensive manual tuning. On the other hand, while deep learning-based approaches can better adapt to environmental changes, they typically demand substantial data for training and often lack flexibility in adapting to new domains. To solve this problem, we propose leveraging the neurosymbolic program synthesis approach to construct adaptable SLAM pipelines that integrate the domain knowledge from traditional SLAM approaches while leveraging data to learn complex relationships. While the approach can synthesize end-to-end SLAM pipelines, we focus on synthesizing the feature extraction module. We first devise a domain-specific language (DSL) that can encapsulate domain knowledge on the essential attributes for feature extraction and the real-world performance of various feature extractors. Our neurosymbolic architecture then undertakes adaptive feature extraction, optimizing parameters via learning while employing symbolic reasoning to select the most suitable feature extractor. Our evaluations demonstrate that our approach, neurosymbolic Feature EXtraction (nFEX), yields higher-quality features. It also reduces the pose error observed for the state-of-the-art baseline feature extractors ORB and SIFT by up to 90% and up to 66%, respectively, thereby enhancing the system's efficiency and adaptability to novel environments. © 2024 IEEE.",TOPIC

To achieve human-like rationality in dealing with the grasping task, the agent requires hybrid intelligence from multilateral aspects. This paper introduces RelationGrasp, a unified framework employing a transformer encoder-decoder structure to simultaneously achieve open-vocabulary object detection, manipulation relationship inference, and grasp pose detection. A unique object-oriented prompt learning mechanism is designed to seamlessly bridge the grasp pose and manipulation relationship branches, delivering high fidelity of object-grasp affiliation for object-aware grasping and grasp sequence planning.

This planning paradigm can lead to unintuitive exploration or replanning latency when entering areas that were previous obstructed from view. To address this we present SceneSense, a real-time 3D diffusion model for synthesizing 3D occupancy information from partial observations that effectively predicts these occluded or out of view geometries for use in future planning and control frameworks. SceneSense uses a running occupancy map and a single RGB-D camera to generate predicted geometry around the platform at runtime, even when the geometry is occluded or out of view. Our architecture ensures that SceneSense never overwrites observed free or occupied space. By preserving the integrity of the observed map, SceneSense mitigates the risk of corrupting the observed space with generative predictions. While SceneSense is shown to operate well using a single RGB-D camera, the framework is flexible enough to extend to additional modalities. Unlike existing models that necessitate multiple views and offline scene synthesis, or are focused on filling gaps in observed data, our findings demonstrate that SceneSense is an effective approach to estimating unobserved local occupancy information at runtime. Local occupancy predictions from SceneSense are shown to better represent the ground truth occupancy distribution during the test exploration trajectories than the running occupancy map.

This method implements a hybrid-object-based state-space Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm to manage needle regrasps. Previous methods have attempted to pick up a loose surgical needle in the environment and then use the same grasp to begin suturing; however, the initial needle grasp is not always ideal in terms of the needle pose with respect to the gripper or the workspace of the arm. Thus, it is advantageous to regrasp the needle in a more optimal manner before suturing proper begins. To solve the problem, a hybrid-object state space (HySS) planner is implemented under the RRT - Connect motion planning framework.

The system is operated remotely with negligible risk to the operator. The integration of information collected by three robots has been achieved by software architecture. With this architecture, it is possible to plan the mission path, optimize the sensor settings and visualize the data from a remote terminal (e.g., a tablet or smartphone). The sensors used for the detection of plastic and metal landmines are installed in a configuration of three robots: microwave radar (Robot #1 with a UWB radar and Robot #3 with HSR radar), LiDAR (Robot #1 and Robot #3), high-resolution camera (Robot #1), and metal detector (Robot #2). The acquisition and processing of data from multiple radar sensors displayed improved detection and classification for small plastic-cased low-metal-content landmines (e.g., M-14 and Type 72) using high resolution microwave radar. These are generally difficult to detect with metal detectors alone. In real scenarios like the ongoing war in Ukraine, surface landmines like the PFM-1 (“butterfly”), are often scattered on the surface, and we demonstrated how artificial intelligence can be applied to detect this type of threat. Finally, because of booby traps rigged to protect minefields, demining also requires the detection of tripwires. For this purpose, the first robot in the team can detect trip wires of different types (metal, fiber or plastic) in real time. The robotic platforms are equipped with GNSS providing mapping of targets with accuracy better than $\text{1 0 ~ c m}$.",TOPIC

Internet of Things (IoT) of networked robots and physiological intervention can be combined to identify and control the spread of the different variants of COVID-19 disease. With this approach, governments and healthcare institutions can plan for such diseases in the future. This article presents a compact computational model (CCM) to identify and control different COVID-19 variants using IoT-networked robots. The CCM comprises seven physiological variables (PVs) and robotic identification (RI) of infected individuals as alternative intervention strategies. This study uses Market Place Service Robots that correctly identify PV and RI for positively infected individuals. The conditions of the existence and the solution of the deterministic model are derived from a compact flow architecture that we develop. We show that the model has COVID-19-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium. While PV with appropriate isolation and hospital treatment reduces the COVID-19 disease impact by 19% more than RI alone, this study also shows that combining two PV with RI minimizes the impact better than PV or RI alone, by 36% and 43%, respectively.

This capability allows a ship to autonomously survey and obtain situational awareness on a floating unresponsive target from a safe stand-off before inspecting it more closely or navigating around it. The target could be another ship, structure, or a navigational obstruction like an iceberg. The proposed solution is a collaborative system with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV), and an unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The UAV captures visual imagery to create a 3-D model of the target’s above-water geometry using photogrammetry. The UUV surveys the target’s submerged hull with integrated imaging and profiling bathymetric sonars. The USV hosts an intelligent mission-planning node which manages the robotic collaboration in a centralized architecture by autonomously planning and distributing the missions for the UUV and UAV. The intelligent node also adaptively plans the USV’s trajectory to support the other autonomous assets, specifically reducing and bounding the UUV’s state-estimate error through collaborative localization. The resulting above- and below-water sensor data is fused at the waterplane, using a sliding correlation algorithm, to yield a 3-D representation of the floating unresponsive target. The contributions from this article include the cross-domain robotic collaboration and autonomous mission-planning toward acquiring and fusing data from heterogeneous robots.

Challenges include the strong static magnetic field, rapidly switching magnetic field gradients, high-power radio frequency pulses, sensitivity to electrical noise, and constrained space to operate within the bore of the scanner. MRI has a number of advantages over other medical imaging modalities, including no ionizing radiation, excellent soft-tissue contrast that allows for visualization of tumors and other features that are not readily visible by other modalities, true 3-D imaging capabilities, including the ability to image arbitrary scan plane geometry or perform volumetric imaging, and capability for multimodality sensing, including diffusion, dynamic contrast, blood flow, blood oxygenation, temperature, and tracking of biomarkers.

However, patient respiration can cause liver drift, causing small target lesions to deviate from the ultrasound imaging plane and become invisible, complicating accurate punctures. To address this, we introduce an automatic robotic respiratory liver motion compensation method, which relies on real-time estimation of liver motion to maintain the stability between the ultrasound imaging plane and the lesion observation plane. We propose an end-to-end respiratory liver motion estimation network, termed ReME-Net. This network effectively utilizes the difference features between the current and target ultrasound frames, combined with the sequential channel-spatial attention mechanism, to accurately estimate the six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) respiratory liver motion in real time, without any tracking device. We employ a hybrid force–position control framework with an adaptive variable admittance controller to ensure stable probe-skin contact while compensating for liver motion, facilitating stable imaging of small lesions. On this basis, a robotic ultrasound imaging system is developed and experiments on a liver motion simulation platform demonstrate successful tracking with mean errors of 3.05 mm in translation, 2.52° in rotation, and 0.25 N in contact force, while periodic liver motion has a translation amplitude of 19.72 mm and a rotation amplitude of 17.32°.

However, this model exhibits significant randomness, which results in limited training effectiveness and low control efficiency. To address these issues, this article proposes an improved deep  $Q$ -network (IM-DQN) approach for intelligent control of the robot’s arm motion. A prioritized experience replay mechanism is employed in the construction of the motion control data experience pool. By using an optimal experience retention strategy and exploration suppression rate, the approach effectively prevents the rapid expansion of the experience pool and avoids network collapse. Furthermore, a dual neural network architecture is introduced, where motion control data and experience pool data are processed separately, aligning the learning process with the reward structure. A Markov decision process (MDP) is applied to establish the motion control model for the coal gangue picking robot’s manipulator, converting the robotic arm path planning problem into a Markov decision problem. Additionally, an intrinsic curiosity module (ICM) is incorporated into the model to enhance motion control, thereby improving convergence speed, control accuracy, and overall performance. Comparative experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms traditional reinforcement learning approaches by preventing network collapse, ensuring control stability, generating shorter and more accurate motion paths for the robotic arm, and improving trajectory accuracy by 17.6% and reducing average path length by 26.2% versus DQN baselines.",TOPIC

The concept of CRM is recently proposed in literature for single-agent MRAC problems, where the reference model (leader) gets feedback from the plant (agent/follower) to facilitate improved transient performance. This letter coins the concept of CRM based distributed MRAC, where it is assumed that the leader/reference model is connected only to a subset of followers and incorporates feedback from them in a multi-agent setting. Distributed parameter estimator and controller are designed, which incorporate inter-agent cooperation via communication over a bi-directional graph. The leader state and the time-varying leader input (also known as reference input in MRAC literature) are only accessible to its neighbours. A novel distributed dynamic surface control (DSC)-like strategy is invoked for each follower to cooperatively estimate the unknown reference input required for control design. Simulation results dictate that the proposed closed-loop leader based formulation leads to better transient performance as compared to the status quo and also enables the use of high gain tuners for adaptive update law. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first work which introduces a distributed protocol of CRM-MRAC for multi-agent systems (CRM-DMRAC) with rigorous Lyapunov analysis.",TOPIC

The combination of legs and wheels might be a solution for any real-world application requiring rapid, and long-distance mobility skills on challenging terrain. In this letter, we present an online trajectory optimization framework for wheeled quadrupedal robots capable of executing hybrid walking-driving locomotion strategies. By breaking down the optimization problem into a wheel and base trajectory planning, locomotion planning for high dimensional wheeled-legged robots becomes more tractable, can be solved in real-time on-board in a model predictive control fashion, and becomes robust against unpredicted disturbances.

The poor expressiveness of task planning domains for characterizing geometric changes with actions and the difficulties faced by current approaches to efficiently identify motion dependencies for plan execution produce expensive callings to motion planning on unfeasible actions and intensive reasoning to find realizable plans. In this work we combine two recent approaches to address these problems. Task planning is carried out using an object-centered description of geometric relations that consistently characterizes changes in the object configuration space. Plan execution is implemented using a symbol to motion hierarchical decomposition that depends on consecutive actions in the plan, rather than on single actions, which permits considering motion dependencies across plan actions for a successful execution. © 2016 IEEE.",TOPIC

As the area to be explored increases, so does the time it takes for robots to explore it. One approach to reduce the required time is using multiple autonomous robots to perform distributed exploration. However, this significantly increases the associated cost and the complexity of the exploration process. To address these issues, in the past we proposed a leader-follower architecture where multiple two-wheeled passive robots capable of steering only using brakes are pulled by a leader robot. By controlling their relative angle with respect to the leader, the followers could move in arbitrary formations. The proposed follower robots used rubber tires, which allowed it to perform well in rigid ground, but poorly in soft soil. One alternative is to use lugged wheels, which increase the traction in soft soils. In this letter we propose a robot with shape-shifting wheels that allow it to steer in both rigid and soft soils. The wheels use a cam mechanism to push out and retract lugs stored on its inside. The shape of the wheel can be manipulated by controlling the driving torque exerted on the cam mechanism. Through experiments we verified that the developed mechanism allowed the follower robots to control their relative angle with respect to the leader in both rigid and soft soils.",TOPIC

However, commodity-grade RGB-D cameras commonly used for sensing fail to register valid depth values on shiny, glossy, bright, or distant surfaces, leading to missing data in the map. To address this issue, we propose a framework leveraging probabilistic depth completion as an additional input for spatial mapping. We introduce a deep learning architecture providing uncertainty estimates for the depth completion of RGB-D images. Our pipeline exploits the inferred missing depth values and depth uncertainty to complement raw depth images and improve the speed and quality of free space mapping. Evaluations on synthetic data show that our approach maps significantly more correct free space with relatively low error when compared against using raw data alone in different indoor environments; thereby producing more complete maps that can be directly used for robotic navigation tasks. The performance of our framework is validated using real-world data.",TOPIC

The possible occurrence of information incompleteness during robot plan execution expects the robot to sense the environment and obtain the missing information actively. A set of planning and reasoning approaches has focused on robotic tasks in incomplete domains. However, the sensing action operators are generally abstracted as passively receiving sensory information and formulating a finite set of observations. The strict constraint of solely sensing without actively acting on the environment greatly reduces the chances of revealing more hidden information. This letter proposes a novel observation plan that couples an atomic sensing action with parallel actuating effects, and an adjoint observation scheme for actively run-time information gathering. To concretely realize the adjoint observation scheme, we present a Hybrid-ASP planning approach that integrates a deterministic task planner for generating an initially valid task plan for task achievement and a logic-based Answer Set Planner to make observation plans. Compared with the baseline planning approaches available, the experimental results have validated improved planning efficiency and plan effectiveness of information gathering from the Hybrid-ASP approach.",TOPIC

This joint approach solves more difficult problems than approaches that address the task and motion subproblems independently. TMP algorithms combine and extend results from both task and motion planning. TMP has mainly focused on computational performance and completeness and less on solution optimality. Optimal TMP is difficult because the independent optima of the subproblems may not be the optimal integrated solution, which can only be found by jointly optimizing both plans. This letter presents Task and Motion Informed Trees (TMIT*), an optimal TMP algorithm that combines results from makespan-optimal task planning and almost-surely asymptotically optimal motion planning. TMIT* interleaves asymmetric forward and reverse searches to delay computationally expensive operations until necessary and perform an efficient informed search directly in the problem's hybrid state space. This allows it to solve problems quickly and then converge towards the optimal solution with additional computational time, as demonstrated on the evaluated robotic-manipulation benchmark problems.",TOPIC

Multimodal grasping has been recognized as a promising strategy to improve the manipulation capabilities of a robotic system. This work presents a novel grasp planning algorithm for hybrid grippers that allows for multiple grasping modalities. In particular, the planner manages two-finger grasps, single or double suction grasps, and magnetic grasps. Grasps for different modalities are geometrically computed based on the cuboid and the material properties of the objects in the clutter. The presented framework is modular and can leverage any 6D pose estimation or material segmentation network as far as they satisfy the required interface. Furthermore, the planner can be applied to any (hybrid) gripper, provided the gripper clearance, finger width, and suction diameter. The approach is fast and has a low computational burden, as it uses geometric computations for grasp synthesis and selection. The performance of the system has been assessed with an experimental campaign in three manipulation scenarios of increasing difficulty using the objects of the YCB dataset and the DLR hybrid-compliant gripper.",TOPIC
10.1109/LRA.2023.3261708,Synergistic Task and Motion Planning With Reinforcement Learning-Based Non-Prehensile Actions,"Robotic manipulation in cluttered environments requires synergistic planning among prehensile and non-prehensile actions. Previous works on sampling-based Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) algorithms, e.g. PDDLStream, provide a fast and generalizable solution for multi-modal manipulation. However, they are likely to fail in cluttered scenarios where no collision-free grasping approaches can be sampled without preliminary manipulations. To extend the ability of sampling-based algorithms, we integrate a vision-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) non-prehensile procedure, pusher. The pushing actions generated by pusher can eliminate interlocked situations and make the grasping problem solvable. Also, the sampling-based algorithm evaluates the pushing actions by providing rewards in the training process, thus the pusher can learn to avoid situations leading to irreversible failures. The proposed hybrid planning method is validated on a cluttered bin-picking problem and implemented in both simulation and real world. Results show that the pusher can effectively improve the success ratio of the previous sampling-based algorithm, while the sampling-based algorithm can help the pusher learn pushing skills.",TOPIC
10.1109/LRA.2023.3315228,Approximate Optimal Controller Synthesis for Cart-Poles and Quadrotors via Sums-of-Squares,"Sums-of-squares (SOS) optimization is a promising tool to synthesize certifiable controllers for nonlinear dynamical systems. Building upon prior works (Lasserre et al., 2008), (Jiang and Jiang, 2015), we demonstrate that SOS can synthesize dynamic controllers with bounded suboptimal performance for various underactuated robotic systems by finding good approximations of the value function. We summarize a unified SOS framework to synthesize both under- and over- approximations of the value function for continuous-time, control-affine systems, use these approximations to generate approximate optimal controllers, and perform regional analysis on the closed-loop system driven by these controllers. We then extend the formulation to handle hybrid systems with contacts. We demonstrate that our method can generate tight under- and over- approximations of the value function with low-degree polynomials, which are used to provide stabilizing controllers for continuous-time systems including the inverted pendulum, the cart-pole, and the quadrotor as well as a hybrid system, the planar pusher. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a SOS-based time-invariant controller can swing up and stabilize a cart-pole, and push the planar slider to the desired pose.",TOPIC
10.1109/LRA.2023.3318118,A Modeling and Data-Driven Control Framework for Rigid-Soft Hybrid Robot With Visual Servoing,"In this letter, a rigid-soft hybrid robot with visual servoing is designed to improve robotic properties of accuracy and safe interaction, where the hybrid robot is connected by a soft robot and six degrees of freedom rigid robot in series. The series structure of rigid and soft parts brings the coupling and complexity to modeling. For synthesis modeling, we develop a state-space equation of the hybrid robot by the combination of the rigid and soft parts, where the rigid model is built by differential kinematics, and Piecewise Constant-Curvature and Lagrange equations are used to model the soft part with consideration of the elastic deformation caused by gravity loading. Based on the synthesis model, a model predictive controller is designed to eliminate the error between the hybrid robot terminal and the target position. Considering the imprecise modeling process disturbs the control performance, a data-driven strategy named input mapping is incorporated into the predictive controller to reduce the inaccuracy model effect and improve the control performance. In addition, the feedback error of the hybrid robot is transferred in the robot terminal coordinate system to avoid hand-eye calibration work. Finally, the experiments on a rigid-soft hybrid robot show the proposed method converges nearly twice as fast as the model predictive control method and two state-of-the-art motion planning methods for the visual servoing of the soft-rigid hybrid robot system.",TOPIC

This letter details a rotorwash-aware motion planning method for Chat-PM, a hybrid aerial-terrestrial vehicle equipped with a robotic arm. With proposed method's adjusting the vehicle's thrust and pose on flat surfaces timely, the rotorwash can be reduced and directed away from targets. To achieve this, we first model the rotorwash velocity distribution of Chat-PM in aerial and surface modes with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The model further functions as an optimization objective of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) method, alongside other objectives including aerial-surface reference tracking and target grasping. An aerial-surface path searching method for the vehicle is then introduced, which takes into consideration both rotorwash velocity and kinodynamic feasibility to generate a high-quality reference for NMPC to track. Experimental results showcase the effectiveness of our proposed planning approach for aerial-surface grasping with rotorwash optimization.",TOPIC
10.1109/LRA.2023.3337593,Hybrid Trajectory Optimization for Autonomous Terrain Traversal of Articulated Tracked Robots,"Autonomous terrain traversal of articulated tracked robots can reduce operator cognitive load to enhance task efficiency and facilitate extensive deployment. We present a novel hybrid trajectory optimization method aimed at generating efficient, stable, and smooth traversal motions. To achieve this, we develop a planar robot-terrain contact model and divide the robot's motion into hybrid modes of driving and traversing. By using a generalized coordinate description, the configuration space dimension is reduced, which facilitates real-time planning. The hybrid trajectory optimization is transcribed into a nonlinear programming problem and divided into subproblems to be solved in a receding-horizon planning fashion. Mode switching is facilitated by associating optimized motion durations with a predefined traversal sequence. A multi-objective cost function is formulated to further improve the traversal performance. Additionally, map sampling, terrain simplification, and tracking controller modules are integrated into the autonomous terrain traversal system. Our approach is validated in simulation and real-world scenarios with the Searcher robotic platform. Comparative experiments with expert operator control and state-of-the-art methods show advantages in terms of time and energy efficiency, stability, and smoothness of motion.",TOPIC
10.1109/LRA.2024.3386017,Force-Position Hybrid Control for Robot Assisted Thoracic-Abdominal Puncture With Respiratory Movement,"Percutaneous puncture is a widely used procedure in the diagnosis and therapy of cancer such as biopsy and ablation operations, while the organs in the thoracic and abdominal cavities are significantly affected by patients' respiratory movement. In this letter, a robotic puncture system with respiratory movement is firstly developed, which can simulate the different motions of body surface and internal organ during respiratory cycle. Then a force-position hybrid control framework is proposed, which includes needle insertion along the planned path at the end of inspiration and respiratory motion following according to interaction force sensing at the other phases. Since it requires only one CT scan at the end of inspiration, which complies with clinical routine procedures. Furthurmore, to avoid tearing damage of tissue, the robotic needle takes a virtual RCM constraint at the needle insertion point when following the respiratory motion. And for better respiratory motion compensation, an admittance control optimization method is proposed based on the maximal needle-tissue interaction force, the respiratory following displacement percentage and the overshoot dis-placement/force. Experiments have been conducted, and results show that compared with position control only, our proposed force-position control can reduce the needle-tissue interaction force by 74% and the target puncure error by 56%, indicating better safety and accuracy of robotic puncture with respiratory movement.",TOPIC
10.1109/LRA.2024.3396023,Actor-Hybrid-Attention-Critic for Multi-Logistic Robots Path Planning,"With the proliferation of express delivery services, the demand for intelligent logistic services is increasing. More and more robots are operating simultaneously, which poses a great challenge to their extraction of key information from a large number of static and dynamic environments. To address this, a Multi Actor Hybrid Attention Critic (MAHAC) algorithm for path planning of multi-logistic robots is proposed. The reward function is improved, based on collision avoidance and accurate arrival at the target location, a power shortage and sparse penalty are added to improve the efficiency of path planning. A hybrid attention mechanism module is designed, with an imbedded Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), to calculate the similarity between key and query. Combining the hybrid attention mechanism with the Multi Actor Attention Critic (MAAC) algorithm improves the ability of multi-logistic robots to extract critical states and action information in a variety of environments. In a simulated warehouse layout based on Amazon's Kiva system, the MAHAC algorithm is compared with MAAC, Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG), and Multi-Actor Soft Actor-Critic (MASAC) algorithms. The MAHAC has a higher reward value, so as to select the better path in the least time, with the highest accuracy and no collisions, and hence is suitable for the path planning scenario of multi-logistic robots.",TOPIC
10.1109/LRA.2024.3502067,A Hierarchical Multi Robot Coverage Strategy for Large Maps With Reinforcement Learning and Dense Segmented Siamese Network,"Complete coverage of multiple robots for a large map is an important collaborative planning task, which is widely used in disaster search and rescue, forest fire prevention, resource exploration, and other fields. It generally focuses on coverage completion with less robot (mostly drone) occupation and higher time efficiency. However, as the map becomes larger, most existing works will fail to remain near-optimal due to escalating complexity. In this letter, we formulate the problem as two levels of traveling salesman problem (TSP) to reduce the complexity, where the lower level is single-robot local coverage planning with preset TSP solutions, and the higher level is multiple TSP (mTSP) global planning executed by multiple robots. To better adapt to dynamic scenarios, we apply a distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that allows efficient online computation, and a dense segmented Siamese network (DSSN) to achieve efficient and effective solutions. We show that compared to existing advanced methods, our strategy can effectively solve the problem with coverage costs decreased by over 30$\%$ average and the execution time reduced to seconds in large maps. Furthermore, our network DSSN achieves an additional improvement with random settings to the previous mTSP architecture. We also discuss the influence of different robot densities and separated block sizes on the results, and demonstrate the adaptability to irregular and large-scale obstacles.",TOPIC
10.1109/LRA.2024.3511435,Multi-Agent Path Finding With Heterogeneous Geometric and Kinematic Constraints in Continuous Space,"Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) represents a pivotal area of research within multi-agent systems. Existing algorithms typically discretize the movement space of agents into grid or topology, neglecting agents' geometric characteristics and kinematic constraints. This limitation hampers their applicability and efficiency in practical industrial scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Priority-Based Search algorithm for heterogeneous mobile robots working in continuous space, addressing both geometric and kinematic constraints. This algorithm, named Continuous-space Heterogeneous Priority-Based Search (CHPBS), employs a two-level search structure and a priority tree for collision detection. To expedite single-agent path finding in continuous space, we introduce a Weighted Hybrid Safe Interval Path Planning algorithm (WHSIPP$_{d}$). Furthermore, we present three strategies to enhance our algorithm, collectively termed Enhanced-CHPBS (ECHPBS): Partial Expansion, Target Reasoning, and Adaptive Induced Priority. Comparative analysis against two baseline algorithms on a specialized benchmark demonstrates that ECHPBS achieves a success rate of 100% on a 100 m × 100 m map featuring 50 agents, with an average runtime of under 1 s, and maintains the same 100% success rate on a 300 m × 300 m map with 100 agents.",TOPIC
10.1109/LRA.2025.3539092,Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Robotic Pushing of Planar Objects With Generic Shape,"Robotic manipulation of objects in cluttered dynamic scenes is challenging for a twofold reason. Object detection and localization are complex due to partial occlusions and high variability in the object classes and manipulation in tight spaces is difficult due to potential collisions. The present letter focuses on the low-level control of the non-prehensile pushing action aimed at moving planar objects of generic shape along a given path with an assigned time law. Based on the continuous and nonlinear dynamics of the system, we propose a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC), which avoids the need for linearization and, thus, the hybrid dynamics arising from it. An extensive comparison with a state-of-the-art linear MPC demonstrates that the NMPC can successfully react to more general disturbances, outperforming the linear one. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the method in a task where a robot is required to grasp fruits in a container with other obstructing objects (shown in the attached video).",TOPIC
10.1109/LRA.2025.3559836,Topo-Field: Topometric Mapping With Brain-Inspired Hierarchical Layout-Object-Position Fields,"Mobile robots require comprehensive scene understanding to operate effectively in diverse environments, enriched with contextual information such as layouts, objects, and their relationships. Although advances like neural radiance fields (NeRFs) offer high-fidelity 3D reconstructions, they are computationally intensive and often lack efficient representations of traversable spaces essential for planning and navigation. In contrast, topological maps are computationally efficient but lack the semantic richness necessary for a more complete understanding of the environment. Inspired by a population code in the postrhinal cortex (POR) strongly tuned to spatial layouts over scene content rapidly forming a high-level cognitive map, this work introduces Topo-Field, a framework that integrates Layout-Object-Position (LOP) associations into a neural field and constructs a topometric map from this learned representation. LOP associations are modeled by explicitly encoding object and layout information, while a Large Foundation Model (LFM) technique allows for efficient training without extensive annotations. The topometric map is then constructed by querying the learned neural representation, offering both semantic richness and computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations in multi-room environments demonstrate the effectiveness of Topo-Field in tasks such as position attribute inference, query localization, and topometric planning, successfully bridging the gap between high-fidelity scene understanding and efficient robotic navigation.",TOPIC
10.1109/LRA.2025.3577462,Collaborative Motion Planning for Multiple Tractor-Trailer Vehicles Based on Local Conflict Search and Priority Game Inheritance,"This paper introduces a novel approach for efficiently planning collision-free optimal trajectories for multiple tractor-trailer vehicles (TTVs) in environments with dense obstacles. The approach employs a hierarchical planning strategy to generate the initial homotopy path: at the higher level, it integrates body collision model and enhances conflict resolution through local priority strategy. At the lower level, the Tractor-Trailer Spatiotemporal Hybrid State A* (TT-SHA*) is employed, combining joint expansion with heuristic methods to efficiently generate paths for individual agents, while accounting for underactuated and nonholonomic constraints. To resolve priority deadlock issues, the concept of priority inheritance and backtracking is integrated into conflict search, which significantly improves the success rate and solving speed. Finally, it refines the path solution into smooth trajectories using nonlinear optimization based on corridor and relative safety distance constraints. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing TTV-improved Multi-Agent Motion Planning algorithms in scalability when handling large-scale TTV scenarios, providing a solution that is applicable for practical implementation.",TOPIC
10.1109/LRA.2025.3592069,Fault Handling in Robotic Manipulation Tasks for Model Predictive Interaction Control,"This letter presents a comprehensive framework for robotic manipulation tasks, incorporating systematic fault handling and recovery strategies.

A three-layered architecture divides the control task into decision-making, trajectory planning, and low-level robot control. The Fault Event Pipeline (FEP) is introduced to provide a structured approach for fault detection of pose and wrench errors, diagnosis, and recovery, supporting both forward and backward strategies. The framework integrates fault handling into task planning and execution, offering a unified solution for reliable robotic operations. Experimental validation with a 7-degree-of-freedom Franka-Emika robot demonstrates the framework's ability to handle diverse faults.",TOPIC
10.1109/M2VIP49856.2021.9664988,Simulation of Solid Meal Digestion in a Soft Gastric Robot using SOFA,"The gastric simulator SoGut is a soft robotic stomach to imitate the gastric motility in the human stomach. The simulator contains seven ring-shaped chambers along the J-shape stomach to perform contractions by applying pneumatic actuation. Experiments conducted previously for gastric emptying focused on liquid meals instead of solid meals, which have higher stiffness and require higher break-down forces. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a simulation model of SoGut when it grinds solid food contents that are beads (diameter 1.27 cm) containing agar gel and water at various mixing ratios. The simulation model is based on Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA), with the advantages of finite element method modelling and real-time simulation. First, the relationships between pressure inputs and contraction ratios of the modelling stomach are identified. Next, a series of peristaltic contractions is successfully simulated. An average error at 0.03 of contraction ratio is found, except chamber #5 that has an error at 0.12. Later, beads with different stiffness are placed in the center of chambers and tested to investigate the amount of forces applied to these contents. The stiffness of beads depends on the mixing ratio of agar gel and water, and the motions of beads are constrained on the cross-section plane of the chambers in order to avoid food contents escaping from the contracting regions. The average forces from different chambers applied on the contents in the antrum part of the simulated stomach are less than 0.9 N, which corresponds to the findings in the human stomach reported by literature. Meanwhile, it is also found that the strength of forces generated from the chambers of SoGut depends on the stiffness of the food contents. Additionally, the results of the simulation indicate that when the initial diameters of chambers increase, the provided average forces reduce.",TOPIC

Research aims to develop ecological protocols that allow personalized interventions based on impairment, functional abilities, and individual needs. This paper presents a preliminary study on the motor assessment component of a robotic rehabilitation protocol that will integrate motor and cognitive evaluation through eye tracking and kinematic analysis. The approach utilizes a bimanual robotic platform with a front-facing camera to guide subjects through gestures like reaching and bringing the hand to the mouth, adjusting movements based on motor and cognitive responses. Real-time vocal feedback enhances interaction, while movement parameters dynamically adapt to response time, motor performance, and task comprehension. Motor assessment combines data from the robot camera and two additional depth sensors, enabling near real-time kinematic and dynamic analysis, as well as an indirect evaluation of motor control. The cognitive assessment is planned to leverage eye-tracking technology for measuring ocular parameters related to attention and cognitive function. The paper focuses on the motor assessment component, presenting preliminary tests using a fixed-camera setup to refine the protocol for future integration with a mobile robotic platform.",TOPIC

10.1109/MICRO56248.2022.00065,AgilePkgC: An Agile System Idle State Architecture for Energy Proportional Datacenter Servers,"Modern user-facing applications deployed in data-centers use a distributed system architecture that exacerbates the latency requirements of their constituent microservices (30--250μs). Existing CPU power-saving techniques degrade the performance of these applications due to the long transition latency (order of 100μs) to wake up from a deep CPU idle state (C-state). For this reason, server vendors recommend only enabling shallow core C-states (e.g., CC1) for idle CPU cores, thus preventing the system from entering deep package C-states (e.g., PC6) when all CPU cores are idle. This choice, however, impairs server energy proportionality since power-hungry resources (e.g., IOs, uncore, DRAM) remain active even when there is no active core to use them. As we show, it is common for all cores to be idle due to the low average utilization (e.g., 5 -- 20\%) of datacenter servers running user-facing applications.We propose to reap this opportunity with AgilePkgC (APC), a new package C-state architecture that improves the energy proportionality of server processors running latency-critical applications. APC implements PC1A (package C1 agile), a new deep package C-state that a system can enter once all cores are in a shallow C-state (i.e., CC1) and has a nanosecond-scale transition latency. PC1A is based on four key techniques. First, a hardware-based agile power management unit (APMU) rapidly detects when all cores enter a shallow core C-state (CC1) and triggers the system-level power savings control flow. Second, an IO Standby Mode (IOSM) places IO interfaces (e.g., PCIe, DMI, UPI, DRAM) in shallow (nanosecond-scale transition latency) low-power modes. Third, a CLM Retention (CLMR) mode rapidly reduces the CLM (Cache-and-home-agent, Last-level-cache, and Mesh network-on-chip) domain's voltage to its retention level, drastically reducing its power consumption. Fourth, APC keeps all system PLLs active in PC1A to allow nanosecond-scale exit latency by avoiding PLL re-locking overhead.Combining these techniques enables significant power savings while requiring less than 200ns transition latency, &gt;250\texttimes{} faster than existing deep package C-states (e.g., PC6), making PC1A practical for datacenter servers. Our evaluation based on an Intel Skylake-based server shows that APC reduces the energy consumption of Memcached by up to 41\% (25\% on average) with &lt;0.1\% performance degradation. APC provides similar benefits for other representative workloads.",TOPIC

10.1109/NAECON49338.2021.9696431,Dynamic Speed Estimation of Moving Objects from Camera Data,"Recent advances in computer vision techniques have led to increasing interest in the use of vision as the only mechanism to estimate the vehicle speed in certain applications. The challenge of making accurate estimations of distances and speeds arises from the discrete nature of video sensors that project the 3D world into a 2D discrete plane. This work will study the concept of estimating the speed of an object by only using the camera data. Rather than using a separate mechanism dependent on camera specifications, we consider a convolutional neural network fed recurrent neural network to estimate the speed at each time step. The video data can be fed to an object detection algorithm to extract the features and patterns in the videos. The network architecture is designed to make use of pre-trained object detection models to extract features from camera video feed and embed them into a data cluster. This cluster can represent the spatiotemporal information of the objects in the video frames. A recurrent neural network is then used to learn the association of the motion speed values with respect to the changes in the features within the cluster. Based on this structure, both the object detector and the recurrent neural network can be trained end-to-end to detect and estimate the speed of objects in videos. This network architecture would not require additional sensors for calibration, while providing a cost-effective solution for mobile robotic applications such as autonomous ground vehicles or drones. The proposed methodology, network architecture and its components will be discussed in detail. This paper also presents a video data case study and preliminary results to demonstrate the development and use of the speed estimation network. Some future work is planned to improve the algorithm accuracy and computing efficiency of the proposed architecture.",TOPIC

The neural circuitry that facilitates automaticity is impaired by stroke, resulting in a compensatory shift toward executive-control, as well as reduced paretic propulsion and increased step-to-step variability. We have developed a soft robotic exosuit to augment paretic propulsion by providing paretic plantarflexor assistance during the propulsive phase of walking. For this preliminary study, we hypothesized that changes in walking automaticity would accompany changes in paretic propulsion. When plantarflexor assistance timings were tuned to reduce propulsion variability-a biomechanical measure of automaticity-a -14.7±2.5% variability reduction was accompanied by increased paretic propulsion (%Δ+6.4±6.3%) and prefrontal cortex activity (A oxygenated hemoglobin:+ 1.08E-04±1.05E-04 M mm). When plantarflexor assistance timings were instead tuned to reduce prefrontal cortex activity-a neurophysiological measure of automaticity-a -1.3E-05±1.1E-05 M mm decrease in oxygenated hemoglobin was accompanied by both increased paretic propulsion (%Δ:+4.4±8.1 %) and reduced propulsion variability (%Δ:-3.7±19.3%). Biomechanical and neurophysiological measures of automaticity are sensitive to exosuit assistance timing changes, but are differentially affected, highlighting the need for individualized tuning.",TOPIC
10.1109/NextComp63004.2024.10779903,A Review of PFCP Cyber Attacks in 5G Standalone for Robotic Telesurgery Services,"The emergence of fifth-generation technology (5G) has revolutionised telecommunication networks, offering enhanced mobile broadband, ultra-reliable (eMBB), ultra-low-latency communications (uRLLC), and massive machine-type communication (mMTC) service classes. This breakthrough has garnered significant attention and investment worldwide, driving innovation and growth in the digital era. However, the adoption of cloud-based 5G core (5GC) networks, while offering scalability and deployment flexibility, has posed challenges to meeting stringent latency requirements, particularly for uRLLC services specifically for robotic telesurgery. To address this problem, mobile network operators (MNOs) have turned to edge computing (EC), using the control and user plane separation (CUPS) architecture introduced in the third-generation partnership project (3GPP) release 14 specification. This architecture enables the deployment of the user plane function (UPF) closer to users, reducing latency, and improving quality of service (QoS). However, the deployment of the UPF as a standalone node on the edge of the network exposes the packet forwarding control protocol (PFCP) to cybersecurity attacks, which pose risks to telesurgery services and could even lead to loss of life. In the existing literature, only a few techniques focus on minimising these attacks when the UPF is deployed on the edge of the network far from the 5GC. Therefore, this paper reviews PFCP attacks and explores machine learning (ML) techniques to mitigate these security threats. This paper further provides recommendations and future research directions for mitigating these attacks.",TOPIC

Our Study in attempt to introduces the conceptual design of a charging station for an AV to the convenience and efficiency of automated operation, enabling vehicles to charge themselves, thereby increasing their autonomy. This study proposed the scientometric-based product design approach. We performed design background seeking by scientometric and descriptive analysis in the first stage. As expected, in the previous designs, the motion of robotic arms is limited due to the spherical range of motion, and therefore it causes the arms could not reach constantly depending on the height of the arm. We propose a design plan containing something new and different from previous designs in the second stage. The concept design that we propose includes an energy source for the charging station that uses renewable energy from a solar cell device, which is designed using a hybrid system, which can be connected off-grid or on-grid.

We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that, in contrast to previous work, can adapt to profound changes in the scenario parameters defining the data harvesting mission, such as the number of deployed UAVs, number, position and data amount of IoT devices, or the maximum flying time, without the need to perform expensive recomputations or relearn control policies. We formulate the path planning problem for a cooperative, non-communicating, and homogeneous team of UAVs tasked with maximizing collected data from distributed IoT sensor nodes subject to flying time and collision avoidance constraints. The path planning problem is translated into a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), which we solve through a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, approximating the optimal UAV control policy without prior knowledge of the challenging wireless channel characteristics in dense urban environments. By exploiting a combination of centered global and local map representations of the environment that are fed into convolutional layers of the agents, we show that our proposed network architecture enables the agents to cooperate effectively by carefully dividing the data collection task among themselves, adapt to large complex environments and state spaces, and make movement decisions that balance data collection goals, flight-time efficiency, and navigation constraints. Finally, learning a control policy that generalizes over the scenario parameter space enables us to analyze the influence of individual parameters on collection performance and provide some intuition about system-level benefits.",TOPIC

While traffic regulations provide clear boundaries, real-world scenarios remain unpredictable due to the complex interactions between vehicles. This challenge has driven significant interest in learning-based approaches for trajectory prediction. We present MMTraP: Multi-Sensor and Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction in BEV. This method integrates camera, LiDAR, and radar data to create detailed Bird's-Eye-View representations of driving scenes. Our approach employs a hierarchical vector transformer architecture that first detects and classifies vehicle motion patterns before predicting future trajectories through spatiotemporal relationship modeling. This work specifically focuses on vehicle interactions and environmental constraints. Despite its significance, multi-agent trajectory prediction and moving object segmentation are still underexplored in the literature, especially in real-time applications. Our method leverages multisensor fusion to obtain precise BEV representations and predict vehicle trajectories. Our multi-sensor fusion approach achieves the highest vehicle Intersection over Union (IoU) of 63.23% and an overall mean IoU (mIoU) of 64.63%, demonstrating its effectiveness in utilizing all available sensor modalities. Additionally, we demonstrate vehicle segmentation and trajectory prediction capabilities across various lighting and weather conditions. The proposed approach has been rigorously evaluated using the nuScenes dataset. Results show that our method improves the accuracy of trajectory predictions and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, particularly in challenging environments such as congested urban areas.

However, there is currently no reliable means of accurate and instantaneous navigation in the vicinity of the Moon. This poses operational limitations on the autonomy of lunar robotic and small satellite missions. We present the preliminary results of a systems architecture study conducted on a new satellite navigation system orbiting the Moon that would effectively extend the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) space service volume to cislunar space. We constrain the analysis to lunar frozen orbits under J2, C22 and third-body perturbations, to achieve stable lunar orbits. The problem formulation includes the following design decisions: (1) Orbit semi-major axis, (2) Number of satellites, (3) Number of orbital planes, (4) Satellite phasing in adjacent planes, (5) Orbit eccentricity and (6) Argument of periapsis. The Borg Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) is used to optimize the satellite constellation design using multiple crossover and mutation operators that can adaptively be selected at runtime. The fitness function takes into account performance, cost, availability and station-keeping delta-V. Specifically, the performance metric assessment is based on the Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP), which is computed over a grid of 500 equidistant points on the lunar surface. The input satellite orbits used in the GDOP computation are obtained from high-fidelity orbit propagation using NASA's General Mission Analysis Toolbox (GMAT). The space segment cost model considers satellite constellation development and production costs. Single satellite costs are based on satellite dry mass estimates derived from the power budget analysis assuming a satellite lifetime of 10 years. The results of the study show that high-performing Lunar GNSS constellations relying on frozen orbits alone can be achieved with 20 satellites but they may be suboptimal for high-latitude regions.",TOPIC

However, the challenge of efficiently and economically constructing reliable wide-area quantum networks remains unresolved. This problem, termed network planning, is typically modeled as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. Existing solver-based solutions for classical networks face scalability issues, while heuristic approaches that sacrifice optimality for scalability heavily rely on human expertise and lack generalizability. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated potential in adaptive decision-making for classical network planning. However, quantum networks introduce unique constraints due to their end-to-end entanglement distribution requirements. To address this, we propose a two-stage quantum network resource allocation framework, QPLAN, that combines multi-agent DRL with traditional optimization solvers. Our approach uses a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning strategy using graph neural networks (GNNs) and transformers for traffic flow and corresponding hardware resource allocation to minimize hardware cost while cooperatively satisfying problem constraints as much as possible. The output of the DRL algorithm is then used as an initial input to prune the solution space, ""warm-starting"" the ILP solver and further improving the solution. This hybrid approach effectively reduces manual effort and enhances scalability. Experimental results show that our method yields near-optimal solutions with better scalability than only using ILP solvers.",TOPIC

This is performed using a state-of-the-art object detection architecture known as Faster R-CNN, trained and tested on a publicly available crop/weed dataset. Various configurations of this network were compared and tested on a Raspberry Pi 4 in order to gauge the usefulness of this detection system in field conditions, in terms of both speed and accuracy. The results show that relatively high speed predictions are possible while using low resolution images, but that significantly more accurate results can be obtained by using larger images, albeit with a significant speed penalty. Depending on the application, however, the low resolution inference may already be adequate.",TOPIC

This is what we currently broadly call now AI and neurotechnology. Two bright examples are ResNet inspired by the projections of a mammalian cortical column and U-Net with close to ResNet ideas and topology. The other interesting cortical column inspired NN architecture is hierarchical temporal memory introduced by the Numenta company. These brain or neuro inspired approaches are widely used in machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, path planning and broader in robotics.In the neurotechnology field I want to reference a lot of interesting and projects dedicated to BCI. Starting from works of Miguel Nicolelis where researchers connected the robotic hand via a computer system with a motor cortex of a monkey and later Lebedev group demonstrated the adaptation of a mammalian brain to create the representation of robotic limb extending biological limbs. I want to pay the special attention to works of Kevin Warwick that implemented invasive nervous system to nervous system interface and the robot managed by neurons of a rat brain developed and trained during the experiment.The commercial company Neuralink recently demonstrated the most advanced 1536-channel BCI exploiting wireless Blue-tooth interface to record and process a brain activity. Elon Musk in his Neuralink presentation last year demanded that one of the nearest goals of the company is spinal cord injury and the recovery of the lost motor control of limbs. Several projects in neurorehabilitation targeted to the motor control demonstrated recently important success using medical programmed neurostimulators.The perspective but currently in early state of the development is the direction of neurosimulation based models that could be used for the robotic system control (exoskeleton) or as neuroprosthesis as the part of closed loop system for example projects simulating the spinal cord, where I can see interesting future opportunities both in medicine and robotics.",TOPIC

State-of-the-art agricultural systems are capable of capturing 3D data of individual crops and reconstructing digital twins. A prominent issue in the field is extracting information about the subject plant from the point cloud data, particularly classifying organelle. To address this problem, a deep neural network with a PointNet-like architecture is proposed to identify organelle of the subject plant. Using datasets of plant images taken from an RGB-camera attached to a robotic arm, 3D point cloud data is generated with structure-from-motion photogrammetry techniques, which is used to train a network to segment local regions of the model. A proof-of-concept segmentation network is presented, trained using a large multi-view dataset of avocados images to identify organelle such as the seed, interior pulp, and exterior skin.

A significant part of the numerous uses of robotics and many countries deciding that whether it’s possible to give identity to the anthropomorphic robots. Different industries hospitals are using the robots. The robots are not limited to these two applications even different sectors are using the different robots according to their needs. Mostly robots are performing the tasks which are difficult for human being. The basic robotic arms, known as three link manipulators, are still in use in micro-to-macro applications, such as chip production. In the field of robotics, robotic instrumentation is essential because without sensors, actuators, and detectors, robots cannot interact with their surroundings.

Though static path-planning and taskallocation algorithms have provided the basis for how autonomous vehicles are guided within structured environments, those approaches usually fail to contend with indeterminacy outside of their modelled world, where there is dynamic obstacle appearance and changing task requirements, thus raising inefficiencies and costs of operations. To address these issues, the paper introduces a new multi-agent coordination system that uses a hybrid A* algorithm, integrating path planning with sophisticated detection methods for dynamic obstacles and improving superior task allocation. The system is supposed to provide improvements in real-time coordination in industries of autonomous vehicles to achieve efficient management of tasks and paths in changing environments.

The uniqueness of UAVs in systems creates a novel set of trajectory or path planning and coordination problems. Environments include many more points of interest (POIs) than UAVs, with obstacles and no-fly zones. We introduce REPlanner, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm inspired by economic transactions to distribute tasks among UAVs. This system revolves around an economic theory, in particular an auction mechanism where UAVs trade assigned POIs. We formulate the path planning problem as a multi-agent economic game, where agents can cooperate and compete for resources. We then translate the problem into a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which is solved using a reinforcement learning (RL) model deployed on each agent. As the system computes task distributions via UAV cooperation, it is highly resilient to any change in the swarm size. Our proposed network and economic game architecture can effectively coordinate the swarm as an emergent phenomenon while maintaining the swarm’s operation. Evaluation results prove that REPlanner efficiently outperforms conventional RL-based trajectory search.",TOPIC

Severely motor impaired people who have lost muscle control could benefit from this technique to control assistive devices, which support them in daily life. However, non-invasive BMIs can distinguish only a few different commands with relatively high error rates, which makes the asynchronous control of a robot with multiple degrees of freedom challenging. Here, we introduce a novel robotic grasping system, which combines scene recognition techniques and autonomous path planning with user interaction instantiated by a hybrid control system based on the electroencephalogram and the electrooculogram. The results show that healthy subjects can reliably perform a grasp-and-place task, arranging four objects at defined positions within 133-331s (193.6 ±61.5s), while they require only a few corrections.

While there have been attempts at using vision-based techniques for these tasks, they mostly use planogram compliance for detection of any anomalies, a technique that has been found lacking in robustness and scalability. Moreover, existing systems rely on human intervention to perform corrective actions after detection. In this paper, we present Co-AD, a Concept-based Anomaly Detection approach using a Vision Transformer (ViT) that is able to flag misplaced objects without using a prior knowledge base such as a planogram. It uses an auto-encoder architecture followed by outlier detection in the latent space. Co-AD has a peak success rate of 89.90% on anomaly detection image sets of retail objects drawn from the RP2K dataset, compared to 80.81% on the best-performing baseline of a standard ViT auto-encoder. To demonstrate its utility, we describe a robotic mobile manipulation pipeline to autonomously correct the anomalies flagged by Co-AD. This work is ultimately aimed towards developing autonomous mobile robot solutions that reduce the need for human intervention in retail store management.",TOPIC

To gain kidney access, the surgeon steers a needle towards the kidney while simultaneously controlling the position and orientation of a US probe to keep the needle in the image plane. To successfully reach the kidney while avoiding delicate structures, a significant level of skill and precision is required. To alleviate the surgeon's cognitive workload, robot-assisted needle tracking can be implemented to autonomously track the needle in the US images and adjust the US probe's position and orientation such that the same portion of the needle is visible in the images. This paper presents a US-guided visual servoing (VS) algorithm to track the translation and rotation of a needle in a plane. Image features representing the desired pose of the needle in the image are defined, through which an interaction matrix is devised to relate the rate of the change of the image features in US images to the required position and orientation of the US probe connected to a robotic manipulator. Experimental results in 4 experimental scenarios in a water tank demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in tracking the needle in real-time with an accuracy of 2.6 mm with a control rate of 20 Hz. Although VS has been used to track surgical targets in the past, this paper proposes the first implementation of VS for needle tracking in longitudinal US images subjected to 3-DOF motion in a plane without any prior knowledge of needle trajectory or additional position sensors.",TOPIC

Fundamental robotic tasks such as grasping, pick and place, trajectory following are at present solved using conventional forward and inverse kinematics (IK), dynamics and trajectory planning, whereas we learn these complex tasks using past experiences. In this paper, we explore developing behavior based robotic manipulation using reinforcement learning, more specifically learning directly from experiences through interactions with the real world and without knowing the transition model of the environment. Here, we propose a multi agent paradigm to gather experiences from multiple environments in parallel along with a model for populating new generation of agents using Evolutionary Actor-Critic Algorithm (EACA). The agents are of actor-critic architecture and both of them comprises of general purpose neural networks. The actor-critic architecture enables the model to perform well both in high dimensional state space and high dimensional action space which is very crucial for all robotic applications. The proposed algorithm is benchmarked with respect to different multi agent paradigm but keeping the agent’s architecture same. Reinforcement learning, being highly data intensive, requires the use of the CPU and GPU cores to be done judiciously for sampling the environment as well as for training, the details of which have been described here. We have run rigorous experiments for learning joint trajectories on the open gym based KUKA arm manipulator, where our proposed method achieves learning stability within 300 episodes, as compared to the state-of-the-art actor-critic and Advanced Asynchronous Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithms both of which take more than 1000 episodes for learning the same task, showing the effectiveness of our proposed model.",TOPIC

The classic Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is designed for particles with no mass or physical dimensions unlike differential robots. Therefore, it cannot be directly used to search for a goal using a robotic swarm. We propose the use of the PSO as a trajectory planner to enable the agents to collectively find the optimal path to a goal. The proposed PSO trajectory planner uses multiple known parameters such as inertia weight, a constriction parameter, two scaling factors and two random weighing factors (for the cognitive and social components of the PSO) optimized for differential robots. The planner takes into account the restrictions derived from the kinematic equations of the robotic agents and the finite dimensions of the search space. For that purpose, it is coupled with the necessary controllers to map particle velocities into smooth and continuous differential robot velocities. Four different controllers were tested, including the Transformed Unicycle Controller (TUC), Transformed Unicycle with LQR (TUC-LQR), Transformed Unicycle with LQI (TUC-QI), and a Lyapunov-stable Pose Controller (LSPC). The TUC-LQI controller outperformed the others in terms of achieving smooth continuous differential robot velocities, while following the paths generated by the PSO trajectory planner.",TOPIC

10.1109/TAI.2023.3341833,A Novel Framework for Improved Grasping of Thin and Stacked Objects,"In this study, we propose a novel top–down grasping approach for robots that combines a deep high resolution convolutional neural network (DHRNet) and a multiview perception-based trajectory planning controller (MP-PC). Unlike the traditional encoder–decoder architecture, DHRNet preserves the high-resolution feature maps and integrates feature maps at different scales to ensure maximum retention of spatial information and its fusion with high-level semantic information. The MP-PC continuously adapts the trajectory planning of the robotic end-effector based on the outputs of the DHRNet in order to respond to situations with low confidence in the grasping detection. As a result, it improves the smoothness and accuracy of the trajectory and avoids entering singularities. We evaluate the performance of the DHRNet on the Cornell and Jacquard grasping datasets, achieving accuracies of $99.50$% and $94.80$%, respectively. In addition, the framework outperformed other methods in real-world experiments using a 7 degrees of freedom Franka Emika Panda robot, especially in scenarios with stacked and thin objects.

10.1109/TASE.2021.3077689,Attention-Driven Active Sensing With Hybrid Neural Network for Environmental Field Mapping,"In environmental monitoring programs, mobile robots have been widely deployed for remote sensing, with the end objective of monitoring and mapping out environmental fields. Complex characteristics and correlations in natural phenomena make it challenging to establish a reliable framework for mobile sensing and field mapping. Furthermore, constraints of onboard resources will limit the ability of mobile robots to cover a large area. This article focuses on the active sensing problem in environmental field mapping and particularly exploits the use of intrinsic interactions among multivariate spatiotemporal data. A novel deep neural network of a hybrid CNN-RNN model is employed to learn the monitored multivariate spatiotemporal field. Specifically, a set of attention mechanisms is designed and embedded in the network, which is able to adaptively capture parameterwise dependencies among the monitored heterogeneous parameters and spatial correlations in geolocations of a surveyed field. The weights of inferred attention facilitate explicit interpretation of the driving parameters and geolocations. Some subregions of interest in the surveyed field are specified by their spatial attention distribution and are actively sensed by following the proposed coverage path planner. Experiments are carried out using a real-world dataset with multisource environmental imagery from a remote sensing program. Experimental results are obtained, which demonstrate the superior mapping performance of the proposed systematical methodology compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, the proposed model is able to quantitatively reveal the driving monitored parameters and geolocations in a regression process. Note to Practitioners—This article was motivated by the need for a practical and systematic approach for reconstruction and planning to execute robotic active sensing (AS) in environmental field mapping. Field robotic applications are not maneuverable in comparison with indoor scenarios due to severe conflict between the need for long execution endurance in the field and the very limited onboard resources. Traditional AS planners normally use statistical model-based informative metrics, which may lead to model misspecification in real-world phenomena. The developed framework in this article yields a novel attention-driven metric to guide AS and mapping. It relies on an attention-based hybrid neural network that reveals the driving variables in terms of the heterogeneities and complexities in a natural environment. The high-priority regions are maximized in a coverage path depending on the inferred spatial attention distribution while maintaining the travel cost of the sensing robots within an available energy budget. Experiments using a remote sensing dataset validate the reliable performance of the proposed framework, in environmental field mapping.",TOPIC
10.1109/TASE.2022.3178266,Merging Global and Local Planners: Real-Time Replanning Algorithm of Redundant Robots Within a Task-Priority Framework,"Task-priority inverse kinematics is a popular motion control algorithm which efficiently handles redundancy in robot manipulators. It has been recently extended in order to handle also set-based control objectives or inequality constraints. As any local motion planner it is prone to the occurrence of local minima. This work further extends set-based inverse kinematics by adding a motion planner in order to avoid such occurrence. Motion planners are usually computationally heavy especially in their eventual implementation with a task-priority architecture. To reduce this issue, the planner is implemented as a sampling-based algorithm which works in the reduced-dimensionality of the robot workspace applying Cartesian constraints only. The output trajectory is then checked against the inverse kinematics algorithm exploiting the redundancy and verifying the fulfillment of the joint-based task constraints. During the motion, inverse kinematics is then used also in real-time to ensure a reactive behavior to address, e.g., mismatch between the a-priori information and real-time perception acquisition. Also, the motion planner runs in background to adapt to changes in the environment or to accommodate incremental mapping. Comparison with alternative approaches are investigated and discussed. The most promising method is validated first in hundreds of numerical simulations to provide a solid statistical analysis and then experimentally with a Kinova Jaco2 7 DOFs manipulator equipped with an RGB-D sensor. Note to Practitioners—In this work we propose a motion planning algorithm that allows to effectively deploy robot manipulators in partially unstructured environments. It is structured in two layers: a Cartesian space global planner guarantees the feasibility of the trajectory with respect to potential obstacles in the environment, while a reactive local planner checks the feasibility at joint level. This architecture allows to define all the safety constraints both at Cartesian and joint space needed to operate in unstructured environments, while keeping the computation time lower with respect to standard approaches that define all the constraints in an offline global planner. The reduced computation time allows to effectively perform real-time replanning operations when needed, making the robotic system capable of adapting to a dynamic environment and suitable for sharing its workspace with human operators.",TOPIC
10.1109/TASE.2023.3259905,Reinforcement Learning-Based Switching Controller for a Milliscale Robot in a Constrained Environment,"This work presents a reinforcement learning-based switching control mechanism to autonomously move a ferromagnetic object (representing a milliscale robot) around obstacles within a constrained environment in the presence of disturbances. This mechanism can be used to navigate objects (e.g., capsule endoscopy, swarms of drug particles) through complex environments when active control is a necessity but where direct manipulation can be hazardous. The proposed control scheme consists of a switching control architecture implemented by two sub-controllers. The first sub-controller is designed to employ the robot’s inverse kinematic solutions to do an environment search for the to-be-carried ferromagnetic particle while being robust to disturbances. The second sub-controller uses a customized rainbow algorithm to control a robotic arm, i.e., the UR5 robot, to carry a ferromagnetic particle to a desired position through a constrained environment. For the customized Rainbow algorithm, Quantile Huber loss from the Implicit Quantile Networks (IQN) algorithm and ResNet are employed. The proposed controller is first trained and tested in a real-time physics simulation engine (PyBullet). Afterward, the trained controller is transferred to a UR5 robot to remotely transport a ferromagnetic particle in a real-world scenario to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. The experimental results on the UR5 robot show an average success rate of 98.86% over 30 episodes for randomly generated trajectories, demonstrating the viability of the proposed approach for real-life applications. In addition, two classical path finding approaches, Attractor Dynamics and the execution extended Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (ERRT), are also investigated and compared to the RL-based method. The proposed RL-based algorithm is shown to achieve performance comparable to that of the tested classical path planners whilst being more robust to deploy in dynamical environments. Note to Practitioners —Deep reinforcement learning methods have been widely applied in computer games and simulations. However, employing these algorithms for practical, real-world applications such as robotics becomes challenging due to the difficulty of obtaining training samples. This paper predominantly focuses on bridging the gap between simulations and the real-world implementation of a reinforcement learning algorithm for a robotic application in the context of miniaturized drug delivery robots and robotic capsule endoscopes. This paper presents the derivation and experimental validation of a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for controlling a magnetically-actuated small-scale robot within a simplified model of the large intestine in the presence of disturbances. We demonstrate the possibility of training a high-fidelity reinforcement learning algorithm fully within a simulated environment before deploying it as-is in a real-world scenario by carrying out different experiments and simulations. Implementing the presented control framework complements a large body of this work, and the results offer a feasibility study of using reinforcement learning algorithms in practice.",TOPIC
10.1109/TASE.2023.3282974,Task Space Compliant Control and Six-Dimensional Force Regulation Toward Automated Robotic Ultrasound Imaging,"Objective: We propose a general control framework for task space compliant motion and six-dimensional (6-D) force regulation towards automated robotic ultrasound (US) imaging. The framework endows a position-controlled robotic manipulator with the capability of accurate compliant motion in free space and accurate force control in motion-constrained environment. Methods: An intuitive six degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) admittance control model expressed in an arbitrary Cartesian body frame is mathematically derived with closed-form task space error mapping. Its practical implementation on widely-used collaborative manipulators is proposed to achieve full task space compliant behaviors and accurate 6-D force control. A hybrid control law is presented to achieve good motion accuracy in free space and improved coupled stability in motion-constrained environment. The coupled model of physical human-robot interaction is established and the reason for the improved coupled stability is analyzed through simulation. Results: Evaluation experiments on the proposed control framework were performed to show the effectiveness. The mean error of compliant trajectory following was less than 0.30 mm in free space. The mean relative force and moment control accuracy in three orthogonal directions was better than 0.5% and 0.8%, respectively. The improved coupled stability under the same model parameters was also confirmed by human-robot interaction experiments. Finally, an automated robotic US imaging experiment on a human volunteer in a real clinical scenario was carried out to show the potential application of our proposed framework. Conclusion: Experimental results have shown the advantages of the control framework, including satisfied force control accuracy, high accuracy of compliant motion, improved coupled stability, and system effectiveness on a human volunteer. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the increasing needs of automated ultrasound (US) scanning for both diagnostic and interventional purpose. Clinical sonographers suffer from repeated workload when performing diagnostic US imaging, which could benefit from automated robotic scanning. Robotic US imaging involves physical interaction between the robot end-effector (i.e., US transducer) and the human body. The dynamics of the interaction is regulated by the control law to guarantee the contact of the US transducer and the safety of the procedure. Most existing works have focused on regulating in-plane contact force in terms of the position without considering the compliance in other dimensions. However, it is not a trivial work to extend the positional compliance to six degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) compliance. As the prevalence of low-cost collaborative robotic arms in medical scenarios, how to perform 6-DoF compliant trajectory following and accurate six-dimensional (6-D) force control on these robotic arms becomes increasingly important. This paper gives a complete general solution to achieve 6-DoF compliant control and 6-D force regulation with accurate kinematics on a position-controlled robotic arm. A hybrid control law is proposed to switch the government of “instantaneous model” and “theoretical model” to achieve compliant motion accuracy in free space and improved coupled stability in motion-constrained environment. No expensive torque sensors and torque control interface are required. And no prior geometric knowledge about the scanning object is needed. We have demonstrated the application for robotic US imaging in a real clinical scenario.",TOPIC
10.1109/TASE.2023.3308785,Viewpoint Planning of Robotic Measurement System for Free-Form Surfaces Based on Visibility Cone Space Explorer,"Free-form surfaces have been widely used in industrial design and manufacturing. For the requirements of measurement efficiency and precision, robots and optical scanners are applied to measure free-form surface parts increasingly. Due to the complex geometry shapes and occlusions of these parts, how to plan accessible viewpoints of a scanner to achieve the expected coverage rate is a challenging task. This paper presents a novel viewpoint planning method based on the visibility cone space explorer (VP-VCSE) for robotic measurement systems with 7 degrees of freedom (7-DOF). A digital twin for the robotic measurement system is implemented to provide core services for robotic measurement tasks, including sensor simulation and collision detection. To generate initial candidate viewpoints, a novel mesh segmentation algorithm based on the hybrid mixture model is proposed, which is convenient to handle the triangular mesh of the target object. Visibility computation for a target object in given viewpoints is the key to dealing with the occlusion problem. For this purpose, a general visibility model of a structured-light scanner is presented to compute visible areas accurately. In order to reduce occlusions, a visibility cone space explorer is designed to search optimal candidate viewpoints considering inverse kinematics and physical collisions simultaneously. The viewpoint planning problem is formulated as a set covering optimization problem and a next-best-view operator is introduced to improve the efficiency of the genetic algorithm for searching the resultant viewpoint set, guaranteeing the expected coverage rate and data overlap rate. The simulation and experiment results for four different test models show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing methods in terms of the uncovered rate and the minimum number of viewpoints. Note to Practitioners—This paper addressed a viewpoint planning problem for the robotic measurement system with a binocular structured light 3D scanner mounted on the end effector of the robot, where a robot and a turntable cooperate to complete the measurement tasks. The goal is to find a minimal number of viewpoints that provides full coverage of the target surfaces. Although many studies have addressed this problem, there is little discussion about strategies to improve coverage rate when the target object has complex occlusions. This paper suggested a valuable practice to construct a visibility cone space to adjust viewpoint to reduce occlusions and improve the overall coverage rate. Simulation and experimental results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. This paper showed how to deal with various constraints that a feasible viewpoint needs to satisfy in the viewpoint generation, viewpoint adjustment, and viewpoint selection phase. Moreover, this paper provided a solution for developing the visualization, simulation, and interaction of a digital twin for the 7-DOF robotic measurement system. All core services for robotic measurement tasks are implemented based on a set of open source libraries, which provides a convenient learning and research software platform for practitioners. In future research, we will study how to improve the intelligence and cooperation of the robotic measurement system through deep learning or reinforcement learning techniques.",TOPIC
10.1109/TASE.2024.3351076,Robot-Assisted Deep Venous Thrombosis Ultrasound Examination Using Virtual Fixture,"Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) is a common vascular disease with blood clots inside deep veins, which may block blood flow or even cause a life-threatening pulmonary embolism. A typical exam for DVT using ultrasound (US) imaging is by pressing the target vein until its lumen is fully compressed. However, the compression exam is highly operator-dependent. To alleviate intra- and inter-variations, we present a robotic US system with a novel hybrid force motion control scheme ensuring position and force tracking accuracy, and soft landing of the probe onto the target surface. In addition, a path-based virtual fixture is proposed to realize easy human-robot interaction for repeat compression operation at the lesion location. To ensure the biometric measurements obtained in different examinations are comparable, the 6D scanning path is determined in a coarse-to-fine manner using both an external RGBD camera and US images. The RGBD camera is first used to extract a rough scanning path on the object. Then, the segmented vascular lumen from US images are used to optimize the scanning path to ensure the visibility of the target object. To generate a continuous scan path for developing virtual fixtures, an arc-length based path fitting model considering both position and orientation is proposed. Finally, the whole system is evaluated on a human-like arm phantom with an uneven surface. The code (https://github.com/dianyeHuang/RobDVTUS) and intuitive demonstration video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xFyqU1rV8c) can be publicly accessed. Note to Practitioners—Robotic ultrasound (US) systems have attracted attention for various applications in the past decades. However, the existing studies are not mature and intelligent enough for some challenging applications, such as DVT exam, which requires rich contact interaction between patients and clinicians. To tackle with this challenge, this study presents a novel human-centric robotic DVT exam program using the technique of virtual fixture. The coarse-to-fine path planning module ensures the repeatability of US acquisitions carried out at different times. During DVT exam, the proposed continuous 6D path virtual fixture can guide clinicians to freely move the probe along the scan path while limiting the probe motion in other directions. In order to perform the compress-release exam, a decoupled position/force controller is developed to precisely generate the contact force conveyed by clinicians and to restrict the probe motion along the probe centerline. We believe such a robot-assisted system is a promising solution to take both advantages of robots about the accuracy and repeatability and human operators about the advanced physiological knowledge.",TOPIC
10.1109/TASE.2024.3398214,A Redundant Parallel Continuum Manipulator With Stiffness-Varying and Force-Sensing Capability,"This paper presents the design, analysis, and validation of a novel redundant planar parallel continuum manipulator (PCM) consisting of four flexible links coupled at the rigid mid- and end-platform. To address complex geometry/static hybrid constraints at the rigid platforms, a general framework is developed for the kinetostatics modeling and analysis. Benefiting from the redundant actuation design, the Cartesian stiffness of the studied PCM can be further adjusted as a secondary task to positioning. Utilizing the proposed deflection-based force sensing method, the external load exerted on the end-effector can also be identified by measuring the pose of rigid platforms. To validate the proposed design, a prototype is built, on which a series of experiments have been conducted. The results show that, with the proposed kinetostatics models, the prototype exhibits a mean position and orientation error of 0.52 mm and 0.41°. Finally, the capability of stiffness-varying and force-sensing is demonstrated to verify the feasibility and potential applications of the designed redundant PCM.Note to Practitioners—This paper is motivated by the need for more adaptable robotic systems in industrial and interactive settings. In this work, a novel redundant parallel continuum manipulator with variable passive compliance and force-sensing capability is presented. This planar manipulator comprises four flexible limbs, each driven by independent linear modules, thus the redundancy in the actuation can be leveraged for varying Cartesian stiffness. By means of measuring the pose of the end-effector, the interaction force exerted on the end-effector can be identified according to the force sensing model. The structural compliance of the manipulator enhances safety in human-robot collaboration, while variable stiffness accommodates the specific requirements of different interaction tasks. Furthermore, the force-sensing capability allows for precise feedback control, significantly improving safety during interactions with humans. Therefore, the presented PCM has the potential for interactive manipulation applications, including delicate and fragile object handling, as well as human-robot collaboration in assembly tasks.",TOPIC
10.1109/TASE.2025.3554653,Real-Time Obstacle Detection for a Biped Robot Climbing on Exoskeleton-Structure Glass Windows,"This paper presents a novel real-time obstacle detection method for a biped climbing robot. It is composed of a modified UNet neural network combined with a large-field separable contextual integration (LSCI) module and machine vision techniques for line detection. Such an approach allows the biped robot to accurately detect and locate metal exoskeleton-structure obstacles on glass curtain walls. Moreover, the algorithm adopts point cloud data collected from a depth camera to ensure precise identification of target exoskeleton-structure frames including the positions and tilt angles, facilitating effective real-time collision-free motion planning for the cleaning robot system. Comparative experiments with other neural networks used for image segmentation demonstrate that the proposed LSCI-UNet architecture significantly improves the frame obstacle detection accuracy on exoskeleton-structure glass windows with limited data. The reported method enables the biped cleaning robots to detect obstacles in real-time and effectively navigate on glass walls with exoskeleton-structure beams. Note to Practitioners—Cleaning glass windows of high-altitude buildings imposes significant risks to human workers due to potential falls, which inspires the deployment of window-cleaning robots for such tasks. Bipedal robots exhibit an ability to navigate inclined surfaces of complex exoskeleton structures. Meanwhile, accurate detection and positioning of metal beam obstacles on the windows is crucial for efficient robotic operations in complex environments. However, detecting such obstacles on transparent glass curtain walls remains a considerable challenge. Particularly, the objects behind the glass curtain cause confusion in obstacle detection. To overcome such issue, this paper proposes a new approach of real-time obstacle detection of a biped climbing robot for cleaning glass windows on an exoskeleton-structure building. The effectiveness of the reported methodology has been validated by conducting experimental investigations.",TOPIC
10.1109/TASE.2025.3564644,Trajectory-Attracted Adaptive Tracking Control for Robotic Systems Based on a Hybrid Guiding Vector Field in Flexible Environments,"This paper proposes a trajectory-attracted adaptive tracking control (TAATC) scheme based on a hybrid guiding vector field (HGVF) for robotic systems, addressing the high operational difficulty and safety concerns inherent in flexible environments. The HGVF is constructed using the characteristics of different task spaces in flexible environments to enable smooth transitions between free space and contact space with adjustable operating velocity, thereby enhancing robustness against environmental interactions and uncertainties. The HGVF can attract the state trajectories of the robotic systems by path convergence of an auxiliary dynamic system, simplifying the trajectory planning process with a time-independent representation of the desired path. In addition, a neural network is employed to compensate for uncertainties in the robotic systems, while a nonlinear duffing function represents the dynamic contact force model of flexible environments. In this way, the TAATC scheme is constructed by using the HGVF and the adaptive neural network, which unifies trajectory planning and tracking control. By using the proposed TAATC scheme, the robotic systems can achieve smooth interaction with flexible environments and obtain the desired tracking force without complex trajectory planning. The stability of the HGVF and the whole control scheme are analyzed by using the Lyapunov theorem. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through both simulation and experimental tests. Note to Practitioners—The motivation of this article is that operational tasks in flexible environments are the most common for robotic systems, where the deformation and fragile nature exist widely in actual applications. The risks of overshooting, oscillations, and other harmful effects during the task execution, especially when transitioning from non-contact to contact tasks, usually degrade the control performances or even damage the flexible objects. In this article, a HGVF-based trajectory-attracted adaptive tracking control scheme is proposed for robotic systems with uncertainty operating in flexible environments. The theoretical derivation demonstrates that the proposed control scheme can attract the robotic system to track a desired trajectory and interaction with flexible environments safely, where the smooth transitioning process is achieved by using the HVGF-based time-independent control method to unify the trajectory planning and tracking control. The satisfactory control performances of the simulation and experimental tests on a robotic manipulator, which interacts with a flexible object, show the practical application on a real robotic system.",TOPIC
10.1109/TASE.2025.3568141,HCNV: Hand-Eye Calibration Based on Surface Normal Optimization and View Selection,"Accurate hand-eye calibration is crucial for robotics and computer vision tasks, such as robotic manipulation and 3D object recognition, as it directly affects operational precision and visual perception. However, existing methods rely solely on point clouds and neglect geometric features like plane normals, leading to suboptimal spatial alignment. Additionally, the lack of an intelligent view selection strategy worsens initial alignment errors, causing cumulative inaccuracies and degraded performance. We propose HCNV, a novel framework that combines optimized point cloud alignment with intelligent view selection to overcome these limitations. Our method uses plane normals and a hybrid genetic algorithm to refine the point cloud transformation matrix, significantly improving spatial alignment accuracy. Furthermore, the intelligent view selection strategy enhances point cloud matching and optimizes view coverage, increasing robustness across various conditions. Experimental results show that HCNV improves calibration accuracy by 20% and reduces computational time by 30% compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality in real-world applications. Note to Practitioners—This paper addresses the robotic hand-eye calibration problem, essential for accurate sensor alignment. Existing methods face two main challenges: 1) the lack of geometric model information, leading to insufficient constraints during point cloud alignment and resulting in cumulative errors, and 2) the absence of a mechanism to filter out views with significant point cloud errors during calibration. To address these issues, we propose a novel hand-eye calibration framework, HCNV, which optimizes point cloud alignment by fitting point clouds to planes, improving relative pose estimation accuracy. Additionally, the framework incorporates an error-based view selection strategy to reduce the impact of reprojection errors during calibration. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques on both synthetic and real-world datasets.",TOPIC
10.1109/TASE.2025.3582945,Model and Collision Avoidance for Motion Planning of Rigid-Soft Robot With Continuous Expression and Input Mapping,"This paper presents a motion planning approach for rigid-soft hybrid robots that incorporates continuous expression and input mapping, aiming to achieve both tracking and collision avoidance. The conventional piecewise constant curvature model utilized in soft robots suffers from issues of discontinuity and singularity. These inherent drawbacks pose significant challenges when attempting to address the nonlinear problems associated with motion planning. To overcome these limitations, we establish a relationship between the length of drive cable and the coordination of robot terminal. Through the application of Taylor transformation, we effectively eliminate the control variation present in the denominator of this expression. Then, the nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) with this model expression and input mapping is proposed for motion planning. By directly constructing the current input and output of the motion planning based on the combination of previous data and substituting the linearized part of the model with this data, we mitigate the impact of model inaccuracies on the solution process. Both the obstacles and robot are modeled as polyhedra, and the collision problem is reformulated in the form of continuous nonlinear inequalities. These expressions are then incorporated into the NMPC optimization function as collision avoidance constraints. This approach enables the attainment of a larger feasible movement area and more precise tracking results during the motion planning process. Finally, experimental and simulation results conducted on a rigid-soft hybrid robot demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method, validating its effectiveness in practical applications. Note to Practitioners—This paper was developed for the motion planning of rigid-soft robots in tracking and collision-avoidance tasks. In industrial robotic arms used in manufacturing processes, it can enhance motion planning to ensure seamless part handling while avoiding collisions with surrounding equipment. For example, in automotive assembly lines, these robots need to precisely pick and place components without hitting fixtures or other robots. In service robots for indoor environments, like those used in hospitals for patient care or in warehouses for inventory management, the proposed method can be used to plan paths that avoid obstacles such as furniture, people, or stacked goods. The ability to convert collision-avoidance constraints into nonlinear continuous inequalities, treating the robot and obstacles as polyhedra, provides a larger motion range, which is crucial in these complex indoor settings.In future work, we aim to improve the algorithm efficiency and real-time performance, which will further expand the applicability of this approach in time-critical robotic applications.",TOPIC

SMC employs a data-driven approach to derive switching policies based on classification models trained based on simulations while guaranteeing system stability based on an extended Simplex approach tailored for two-tier platforms. To evaluate the performance of industrial control over edge computing platforms, we have developed WCPS-EC, a real-time hybrid simulator that integrates simulated plants, real computing platforms, and real or simulated wireless networks. In a case study of an industrial robotic control system, SMC significantly outperformed both a local controller and an edge controller in face of varying data loss in a wireless network.",TOPIC

While this modular organization seems crucial for the learning of complex motor skills and the flexible adaption of behavior to new circumstances, the problem of learning meaningful, compositional abstractions from sensorimotor experiences remains an open challenge. Here, we introduce a computational learning architecture, termed as surprise-based behavioral modularization into event-predictive structures (SUBMODES) that explores behavior and identifies the underlying behavioral units completely from scratch. The SUBMODES architecture bootstraps sensorimotor exploration using a self-organizing neural controller. While exploring the behavioral capabilities of its own body, the system learns modular structures that predict the sensorimotor dynamics and generate the associated behavior. In line with recent theories of event perception, the system uses unexpected prediction error signals, i.e., surprise, to detect transitions between successive behavioral primitives. We show that, when applied to two robotic systems with completely different body kinematics, the system manages to learn a variety of complex behavioral primitives. Moreover, after initial self exploration the system can use its learned predictive models progressively more effectively for invoking model predictive planning and goal-directed control in different tasks and environments.",TOPIC

Since time is an inseparable part of cognition, there is a growing interest in the artificial intelligence approach to subjective time, which has a possibility of advancing the field. The current survey study aims to provide researchers with an interdisciplinary perspective on time perception. First, we introduce a brief background from the psychology and neuroscience literature, covering the characteristics and models of time perception and related abilities. Second, we summarize the emergent computational and robotic models of time perception. A general overview to the literature reveals that a substantial amount of timing models are based on a dedicated time processing like the emergence of a clock-like mechanism from the neural network dynamics and reveals a relationship between the embodiment and time perception. We also notice that most models of timing are developed for either sensory timing (i.e., ability to assess an interval) or motor timing (i.e., ability to reproduce an interval). The number of timing models capable of retrospective timing, which is the ability to track time without paying attention, is insufficient. In this light, we discuss the possible research directions to promote the interdisciplinary collaboration in the field of time perception.",TOPIC

As a solution, feature learning has empirically shown substantial improvements in obtaining representations that are generalizable to different tasks, compared to feature engineering approaches, but it requires a large amount of data and computational capacity. These challenges are specifically relevant in robotics due to the low signal-to-noise ratios inherent to robotic data, and to the cost typically associated with collecting this type of input. In this article, we propose a deep probabilistic method based on convolutional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) to learn visual features suitable for interaction and recognition tasks. We run our experiments on a self-supervised robotic sensorimotor data set. Our data were acquired with the iCub humanoid and are based on a standard object collection, thus being readily extensible. We evaluated the learned features in terms of usability for: 1) object recognition; 2) capturing the statistics of the effects; and 3) planning. In addition, where applicable, we compared the performance of the proposed architecture with other state-of-the-art models.

Most studies explore data-driven pattern recognition techniques that are generally highly dependent on learning data and insufficiently effective for emotion contextual recognition. In this article, a hybrid model-based emotion contextual recognition approach for cognitive assistance services in ubiquitous environments is proposed. This model is based on: 1) a hybrid-level fusion exploiting a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural-network model and the possibilistic logic and 2) an expressive emotional knowledge representation and reasoning model to recognize nondirectly observable emotions; this model exploits jointly the emotion upper ontology (EmUO) and the n-ary ontology of events HTemp supported by the NKRL language. For validation purposes of the proposed approach, experiments were carried out using a YouTube dataset, and in a real-world scenario dedicated to the cognitive assistance of visitors in a smart devices showroom. Results demonstrated that the proposed multimodal emotion recognition model outperforms all baseline models.

We report the performance of the system from trials executed over one and a half years in forests in three European countries. Our results with the ANYmal robot demonstrate that we can survey plots up to 1-ha plot under 30 m while also identifying trees with typical diameter at breast height (DBH) accuracy of 2 cm. The findings of this project are presented as five lessons and challenges. In particular, we discuss the maturity of hardware development, state estimation limitations, open problems in forest navigation, future avenues for robotic forest inventory, and more general challenges to assess autonomous systems.

When the environments are unknown, prior motion planning for navigation may not always be available. This article presents a novel Sim-to-Real method to guide a cable-driven soft robot in a static environment under the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA). The scenario aims to resemble one of the steps during a simplified transoral tracheal intubation process where a robotic endotracheal tube is guided to the upper trachea–larynx location by a flexible video-assisted endoscope/stylet. In SOFA, we employ the quadratic programming inverse solver to obtain collision-free motion strategies for the endoscope/stylet manipulation based on the robot model and encode the virtual eye-in-hand vision.

This article presents a fast real-time instance segmentation network (FRISNET) by fusing the information from the frequency domain and space domain. Based on you only look at coefficients (YOLACT), which is the fastest instance segmentation method, the frequency domain representation is introduced into a convolutional neural network (CNN). By fast Fourier transform (FFT), features of different frequencies extracted from the frequency domain are fused with the characteristic map of the spatial domain.

However, moving obstacles with unpredictability in dynamic scenarios, usually increase the difficulty and complexity in collision avoidance of robotic vehicles. To enhance the stability of collision avoidance and boost its adaptability to uncertain dynamic scenes, a new attention-based value classification actor-critic (AVCAC) architecture is proposed. It is an end-to-end robot navigation model that utilizes imperfect local observation to directly plan accurate collision-free motion commands. First, we design a value-classified rollout replaybuffer to categorize the experiences into different pools. It can prevent any overfitting or bias that may result from repeatedly sampling experiences of a certain type during policy learning. Then, we improve the conventional actor-critic network with a multi-head local attention module to extract the local observations at entity-level. This way, the collision avoidance system can focus on key environmental features to operate more efficiently and respond more swiftly to dynamic changes in the environment. Moreover, a lookahead multi-step prediction (LMP) reward setting is devised in the AVCAC-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework to facilitate more informed and forward-looking decision-making.

Traditional optimizations like genetic algorithms struggle with computational complexity and dynamic planning. Meanwhile, pure multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)—a type of machine learning where multiple agents learn to optimize their decisions through interactions with each other and the environment—faces the curse of dimensionality and communication overhead, which limits the large-scale deployment of dynamic vehicular networks. This paper proposes an innovative approach to joint spectrum allocation and power control within dense V2X networks, conceptualizing it as an MARL-based multi-objective optimization problem. To mitigate computational demands, we adopt a hybrid approach combining centralized-training-with-decentralized-execution paradigm, alongside parameter-sharing techniques, within classic Mean-Field MARL (MF-MARL) framework, and name it Scalable-V2X-MF-MARL (ScalV-MF-MARL), enabling a lightweight training process in dense V2X networks with numerous V2V agents. It also technically encodes observations and mean field of actions, thereby enhancing the model's dynamism and scalability. This advancement permits the application of a single model across varying vehicle densities. Experimental results demonstrate that ScalV-MF-MARL achieves 99.5% of the performance of density-specific MF-MARL models, while reducing GPU memory usage by 79.49% to 94.03% during training as vehicle number increases from 40 to 160. Additionally, it outstrips conventional algorithms. Its generalization capabilities across diverse V2X network densities facilitate training in less dense scenarios, with seamless application to denser networks. In conclusion, ScalV-MF-MARL streamlines the V2X network deployment and effectively handles dynamic changes in vehicle numbers.",TOPIC

Controlling such a system requires meticulous planning of subsequent subtasks, queried to the individual agents, in order to execute the master task successfully. Real-time (re)planning is essential to ensure the task can still be achieved when subtasks execution suffers from uncertainty or when the master task changes intermittently requiring real-time reconfiguration of the plan.

We control the planar position and orientation of an object using two underactuated manipulators so that only the position of the object can be controlled directly. The desired orientation follows from the accumulation of alternating relative angles. A time-invariant policy function is trained using deep reinforcement learning, which can determine a finite sequence of pick-and-place maneuvers to manipulate the object to a desired configuration.

In practice, VS control suffers potential stability and convergence problems due to image and physical constraints, e.g., field of view constraints, image local minima, obstacle collisions, and occlusion. Therefore, this article proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning-based hybrid visual servoing (DRL-HVS) controller for motion planning of VS tasks. DRL-HVS controller takes current observed image features and camera pose as inputs, and the core parameters of hybrid VS are dynamically optimized using a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to obtain an optimal motion scheme, considering image/physical constraints and robot motion performance. In addition, an adaptive exploration strategy is proposed to further improve the training efficiency by adaptively tuning the exploration noise parameters. In this way, the offline pretrained DRL-HVS controller in the virtual environment, where the DDPG actor–critic network is continuously optimized, can be quickly deployed to a real robot system for real-time control. Experiments based on an eye-in-hand VS system are conducted with a calibrated HIKVISION RGB camera mounted on the end-effector of a GSK-RB03A1 six degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) robot.

10.1109/TMECH.2024.3409938,The Real-Time Local Surface Model Construction Method of Unknown-Model Workpieces for Robotic Polishing,"Polishing is a critical surface processing technology that has a significant impact on the surface quality and service life of workpieces. Although robots are capable of performing automated operations in structured scenarios, robotic polishing systems for workpieces without a surface model still heavily depend on manual operation due to the inability to plan the polishing pose on the workpiece surface, resulting in high cost, low efficiency, and uncontrollable quality. This article presents a hybrid contact/noncontact measurement method for obtaining a local surface model consisting of three parts: first, a method is proposed for modeling a local workpiece surface based on a binary quadratic equation; then, the design and calibration of a hybrid measurement device is proposed for simultaneously obtaining four discrete points on the surface used to construct its model; and finally, a method is proposed for verifying the accuracy of the constructed local surface model by obtaining and tracking the normal direction of the surface. The proposed method is validated through simulation analysis and actual evaluation in various types of experimental scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively obtain the unknown model workpiece surface model and realize the requirement of a robotic polishing process along the normal direction of surface.",TOPIC

Nevertheless, key technologies such as output force, navigation, and operational performance in robot-assisted pelvic fracture reduction surgery require further development. This article introduces an improved serial-parallel hybrid robot system designed to manage the high forces involved in surgery. The system integrates surgeon remote control with autonomous robot control, improving surgical flexibility and precision. Additionally, a navigation system employing dual-view 2D-3D registration algorithms and optical tracking technology enables real-time observation of fragments for accurate reduction operations. Experimental results show that the navigation system established based on dual-view 2D-3D registration algorithms achieves an accuracy of 1.83 ± 0.03 mm, providing real-time feedback on fragment's positions. In in vitro pelvic fracture reduction experiments, the system exhibits an average reduction error of 2.27 ± 0.31 mm and 0.58 ± 0.17°, categorizing it as excellent. Meanwhile, the closed-loop control approach established can accurately track the planned path.

In this study, we developed a two-degree-of-freedom robotic ankle exoskeleton that provides active assistance in both inversion–eversion and plantarflexion using a hybrid material design. This exoskeleton is lightweight, weighing 1.2 kg fully assembled, and offers a rapid step response, demonstrated by rise times of 69 ms $\pm$ 8.4e $-$4 for plantarflexion, and 95 ms $\pm$ 5.4e$-$2 for inversion–eversion. The device presents a gain-limited torque control bandwidth of 16 Hz for plantarflexion and 12 Hz for inversion–eversion. It can generate peak torques of 70 N$\cdot$ m for plantarflexion and $\pm$ 14 N $\cdot$ m for inversion–eversion. In trials where two healthy individuals walked using the device, tracking errors were found to be on average 1.5 $\pm$ 1.4 N $\cdot$ m for plantarflexion and 1.0 $\pm$ 0.7 N $\cdot$ m for inversion–eversion. A single subject was also used as a case study to determine the potential effect of inversion assistance on frontal plane balance. The subject was able to decrease the step-width variability during walking by 58.3% when compared to the no exoskeleton condition. These results indicate that this device could serve as an effective tool for developing and testing balance-centric methodologies in controlled human subject studies.",TOPIC

Although, different assistive robotic systems have been developed to perform essential tasks around the head, these existing robotic systems are either manually controlled, shared controlled or interactive ones. Although, fully autonomous robotic systems can have the potential of eliminating several limitations of the existing systems, such systems are limited in design due to critical issues of increased complexities and the associated risks. In this article, a hybrid impedance controller-based autonomous assistive robotic system for tooth brushing assistance is developed. A fixed base manipulator with an attached automatic tooth brush and Kinect RGB-D sensor are proposed as a platform to achieve the brushing task. An online face detection, mouth detection, head pose estimation and trajectory planning for the brushing task are achieved. Additionally, online re-planning the trajectories in case of patients’ head pose changes is taken into account. The controller performance is evaluated regarding tracking the generated brushing trajectories and the desired force trajectory by co-simulating the manipulator’s dynamics in ADAMS and SIMULINK. The results demonstrate the capability of the proposed robotic system to achieve tooth brushing autonomously.",TOPIC

Foot-controlled interfaces have proven suitable for controlling robot arms, however, when it is best to use such devices and what limitations they place when controlling a supernumerary robotic limb (SL) in combination with the natural limbs (NLs) is unknown. Here, we report an investigation of three-handed manipulation with a foot interface. We analysed i) what effect the addition of a SL has on the performance of the NLs; and ii) how mechanical and/or cognitive coupling alters user performance. When the subjects moved the three limbs without coupling, only the motion’s completion time was observed to be significantly affected. In contrast with coupling, the incorporation of the foot controlled hand was found to affect the success rate, and planning of the motion, however it did not affect motion characteristics such as smoothness.",TOPIC

Intelligent ankle-foot prostheses have the potential to improve quality of life in people with limb loss, but there are scientific, clinical, and commercial barriers that prevent widespread impact. Further research tools and experiments are needed to expand our understanding of how to design and control intelligent prosthetic limbs. We designed and built a robotic ankle-foot prosthesis with off-board actuation and control to serve as a platform for biomechanical lower limb loss research. Our prosthesis fits inside of a shoe during walking and attaches to standard clinical prosthesis componentry, including carbon fiber prosthetic footplates and pyramid adapters. Our novel mechanical architecture implements a custom torsion spring in parallel with the ankle joint to allow for dorsiflexion and plantarflexion torque control with a single off-board actuator. Benchtop tests show that our prosthesis has peak plantarflexion torques greater than 175 Nm and a torque control bandwidth of 6.1 Hz. Walking experiments with two participants with lower limb loss indicate that the prosthesis can achieve low torque tracking errors and push-off power greater than the biological ankle during walking. This device will enable future experiments on amputee gait biomechanics, human-robot interaction, and prosthesis control.",TOPIC
10.1109/TMRB.2024.3407370,A Series-Parallel Hybrid Pelvic Fracture Reduction Surgical Robotic System Based on Novel 6-DOF Force Amplification Mechanism,"Robot-assisted closed reduction surgery is recognized as the optimal approach for pelvic fractures. However, existing surgical robotic systems often lack the necessary output force to overcome soft tissue tension. To address this limitation, we propose a novel surgical robotic system to deliver high output force with required workspace. Our approach includes the design of a 6-DOF parallel mechanism that utilizes the lever principle for force amplification. The distribution laws of its effective workspace and force amplification gain coefficient are investigated. Additionally, a series-parallel hybrid surgical robot system is developed, which demonstrates the amplification effect on the output force through the force amplification mechanism. To ensure smooth operation of the system, a comprehensive surgical operation framework isdevised that encompasses target pose planning, reduction path planning, real-time intraoperative navigation and control. Modeling experiments show promising results, with an average reduction accuracy of 0.31 mm and 0.24° under no load, and 1.03 mm and 0.34° under loads ranging from 0N to 475N. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our proposed force amplification mechanism in achieving substantial output force amplification while alleviating the surgeon’s burden. Moreover, our robotic system demonstrates the capability to achieve precise pelvic fracture reduction, significantly enhancing surgical outcomes.",TOPIC

Furthermore, safety considerations require a fail-safe design whereby some passive compliance is used for an added layer of safety and for sensing the lateral load on the steerable portion of the catheter. To address these needs, we propose a novel multi-articulated robotic catheter technology that aims to increase technical precision, reduce procedural time and radiation exposure, and enable the semi-automation of catheters during neuroendovascular procedures. This catheter uses joint-level sensing and fluoroscopic imaging to actively bend in two separate planes. Its design also uses series-elastic actuation for increased safety and active compliance (self-steering). We present the design, kinematic modeling, and calibration of this system. A multi-mode real-time control architecture of the system was implemented and experimentally validated. We demonstrate the use of the robotic catheter for branch selection, insertion in an unknown channel under active compliance, and autonomous deployment within a 2D vasculature model. Furthermore, we developed algorithms for intra-operative catheter tracking and pose filtering. Methods presented in this paper make significant strides towards the future goal of enabling semi-autonomous navigation for neuroendovascular procedures.",TOPIC
10.1109/TMRB.2024.3504002,Design and Transparency Assessment of a Gait Rehabilitation Robot With Biomimetic Knee Joints,"Robotic exoskeletons are being increasingly used in clinics for the treatment of medicable disabilities. These exoskeletons, which closely couple with patients’ limbs, need to move in harmony with the endoskeleton motions. To achieve coordination, exoskeletons should be transparent; in other words, they should not interfere with natural human motion or their underlying coordination strategies. Transparency can be achieved through a bio-inspired exoskeleton design and also by implementing appropriate force control methods to maneuver exoskeleton motions. A new hybrid active-passive Gait Exoskeleton-Assisted Rehabilitation (GEAR) robot is presented here for the rehabilitation of lower limb disabilities. The GEAR robot is designed to enhance transparency incorporating a flexible hip joint and a biomimetic knee joint. The proposed GEAR robot also integrates a Remote Centered Motion (RCM) based passive mechanism to support torso and pelvic motions in two planes and features actuated exoskeleton legs in the sagittal plane for treadmill-assisted walking. The exoskeleton legs are actuated at their hip and knee joints using backdrivable actuators. To provide a natural walking experience, the hip joints of the exoskeleton legs offer two passive degrees of freedom in the frontal and transverse planes in addition to the actuated sagittal plane motion. The biomimetic design of the exoskeleton knee joint ensures alignment with the human anatomical knee joint by closely tracking the latter’s instantaneous center of rotation (ICR). To evaluate GEAR robot’s transparency, a comparative study was conducted, involving three healthy subjects. The participants walked freely on a treadmill and then with the GEAR robot operated first in a completely backdrivable (i.e., passive) mode and subsequently in an active mode. The sEMG data collected during these experiments were analyzed to assess robot’s transparency.",TOPIC

This kind of lightweight, scalable and green network architecture will be well-received. In a wide variety of IoT application scenarios, sensor nodes deployed in a local space, such as a multistory building, automatically form a distributed 3D wireless IoT and it can be employed to collect and analyze environmental information. Source-location privacy protection is of great importance in these networks and however, most existing schemes focus on only planar distributed networks which are not suitable for the 3D networks. In this paper, we consider a novel trace-back attack for 3D wireless IoT and then design a source-location privacy protection scheme, named DMR-3D, to defend this kind of novel attacks. In DMR-3D, the source node first selects a set of virtual locations to indirectly choose a set of agent nodes based on the cold start sphere structure and the ellipsoid communication pipeline. Then, a sophisticated mechanism is designed based on both the connected graph and Multiple Delaunay Triangulation (MDT) structure of the network to deliver packets from the source node to the destination node via these agent nodes in a relay manner. Analysis and simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme can effectively protect source-location privacy with a moderate increment of path stretch, time delay and data transmission amount.",TOPIC
10.1109/TNSM.2020.2997734,BALANCE: Link Flooding Attack Detection and Mitigation via Hybrid-SDN,"Link Flooding Attack (LFA) is a genre of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. LFA can cut off a target area from the network, without directly attacking the target. The attacker chooses links which when cut off will disconnect the target area and instruct the bots to flood those links with small packets. Some of the existing solutions are suitable for specific routing methods like shortest path routing or need cooperation between Autonomous Systems (AS). To overcome certain hitches of existing solutions, we have proposed a novel mechanism named BALANCE. It detects and mitigates LFA via hybrid-Software-Defined Network (SDN). SDN splits the control and data plane using OpenFlow protocol. Hybrid SDN has both legacy and SDN nodes, with a controller in the control plane. We have used Service Based Hybrid SDN (SBHS), which is a type of hybrid-SDN. BALANCE begins with an algorithm that chooses nodes in an AS to be SBHS enabled in such a way that the controller can get statistics of all the links in the AS. Next, congestion detection and location algorithms are implemented in the controller to find the congested links. Finally, LFA bot detection and mitigation algorithms are implemented in the controller to mitigate LFA. BALANCE was evaluated in testbed and emulator. We compared the results with state-of-the-art solutions. BALANCE was able to detect LFA bots at a precision of 97.64% and had HTTP response time of 2 seconds during the LFA attack.",TOPIC

Eye gaze-based control interfaces offer a non-invasive way to infer intent and reduce the cognitive burden on operators of complex robots. Eye gaze is traditionally used for “gaze triggering” (GT) in which staring at an object, or sequence of objects, triggers pre-programmed robotic movements. We propose an alternative approach: a neural network-based “action prediction” (AP) mode that extracts gaze-related features to recognize, and often predict, an operator’s intended action primitives. We integrated the AP mode into a shared autonomy framework capable of 3D gaze reconstruction, real-time intent inference, object localization, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic trajectory planning. Using this framework, we conducted a user study to directly compare the performance of the GT and AP modes using traditional subjective performance metrics, such as Likert scales, as well as novel objective performance metrics, such as the delay of recognition. Statistical analyses suggested that the AP mode resulted in more seamless robotic movement than the state-of-the-art GT mode, and that participants generally preferred the AP mode.",TOPIC

The increasing global prevalence of stroke has heightened the need for effective rehabilitative solutions which address both motor and cognitive dysfunction simultaneously. Robotic-aided therapies, including SRFs, provide promising means towards enhancing self-sufficiency and independence in individuals with post-stroke. However, a full understanding of how individuals with post-stroke interact and adapt to SRFs remains elusive despite being key to optimizing SRF efficacy. Electroencephalography (EEG) was employed here to study cognitive adaptability during daily SRF-assisted tasks. Specifically, functional connectivity and graph theory analytical metrics were applied to the experimental data to elucidate alterations in cerebral connectivity of the frontal cortex. Our findings reveal significant changes in EEG activity during SRF-assisted tasks, with notable impact on attention, motor planning, and emotional expression. Moreover, disruptions in local neuronal connectivity imply potential challenges in SRF-assisted activities. This work not only expands our understanding of neural dynamics, as associated with SRF use, but also lays the foundation for future research into the cognitive aspects of assistive technologies, paving the way for the design and development of more effective holistic rehabilitation interventions for stroke survivors.",TOPIC
10.1109/TPWRS.2021.3078446,A Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Multi-Agent Framework to Enhance Power System Resilience Using Shunt Resources,"Existing power system resilience enhancement methods, such as proactive generation rescheduling, movable sources dispatch, and network topology reconfiguration, do not explore the capability and flexibility of shunts to maintain voltage stability during and after disrupting events. Besides, existing methods rely on accurate system models that are not easily scalable for large integrated power grids. In this paper, a data-driven multi-agent framework based on a deep-reinforcement-learning algorithm is proposed to overcome the computation and scalability concerns related to precise system models and to plan for the deployment of shunts for power system resilience enhancement. Specifically, voltage violations due to outages of multiple lines during windstorms are taken as an example of a power system resilience improvement problem. Then, a multi-agent based hybrid soft actor critic (HSAC) algorithm is developed for offline siting and sizing as well as online controlling of shunt reactive power compensators to enhance voltage resilience. The HSAC algorithm is derived from the fundamental SAC algorithms that contain both continuous and discrete action spaces. The proposed multi-agent framework learns from previous experiences and eventually gets trained to determine proper locations and sizes for shunts to avoid voltage violations during multiple line failures. The proposed approach is demonstrated on the IEEE 57-bus and IEEE 300-bus systems. The results show that the proposed multi-agent framework is effective for installation planning and controlling of shunts to enhance power system resilience.",TOPIC

This article provides a principled formalism to address online adaptation in joint planning problems such as Dyadic collaborative Manipulation (DcM) scenarios. We propose an efficient bilevel formulation that combines graph search methods with trajectory optimization, enabling robotic agents to adapt their policy on-the-fly in accordance to changes of the dyadic task. This method is the first to empower agents with the ability to plan online in hybrid spaces; optimizing over discrete contact locations, contact sequence patterns, continuous trajectories, and force profiles for co-manipulation tasks. This is particularly important in large object co-manipulation that requires changes of grasp-holds and plan adaptation. We demonstrate in simulation and with robot experiments the efficacy of the bilevel optimization by investigating the effect of robot policy changes in response to real-time alterations of the dyadic goals, eminent grasp switches, as well as optimal dyadic interactions to realize the joint task.",TOPIC

Examples include, but not limited to, the integrated task and motion planning and optimal control of hybrid systems involving both continuous and discrete dynamic behaviors. For decision-making of robotic systems to improve operational efficiency, safety, and/or mission success rate, they involve both discrete variables representing task allocation or transitions between discrete modes and continuous variables representing trajectories of the planned motion or states governed by differential equations. This paper formulates a class of mixed-type decision-making problems with polynomial objective and constraints as quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problems and a nonconvex optimization method based on alternating direction method of multipliers is proposed to solve the QCQP. The proposed optimization method consists of three sequential subproblems, all of which admit closed-form solutions. Moreover, convergence proof of the optimization algorithm is provided. Two representative problems, traveling salesman with obstacle avoidance and rendezvous and docking of a charging station with distinct phase constraints, are described and solved via the proposed method. Numerical simulations as well as experimental verification of both problems are presented and compared with a state-of-art method to validate the effectiveness, efficacy and robustness of the nonconvex optimization method.",TOPIC
10.1109/TRO.2021.3075365,Object Handovers: A Review for Robotics,"This article surveys the literature on human–robot object handovers. A handover is a collaborative joint action, where an agent, the giver, gives an object to another agent, the receiver. The physical exchange starts when the receiver first contacts the object held by the giver and ends when the giver fully releases the object to the receiver. However, important cognitive and physical processes begin before the physical exchange, including initiating implicit agreement with respect to the location and timing of the exchange. From this perspective, we structure our review into the two main phases delimited by the aforementioned events: a prehandover phase and the physical exchange. We focus our analysis on the two actors (giver and receiver) and report the state of the art of robotic givers (robot-to-human handovers) and the robotic receivers (human-to-robot handovers). We report a comprehensive list of qualitative and quantitative metrics commonly used to assess the interaction. While focusing our review on the cognitive level (e.g., prediction, perception, motion planning, and learning) and the physical level (e.g., motion, grasping, and grip release) of the handover, we also discuss safety. We compare the behaviors displayed during human-to-human handovers to the state of the art of robotic assistants and identify the major areas of improvement for robotic assistants to reach performance comparable to human interactions. Finally, we propose a minimal set of metrics that should be used in order to enable a fair comparison among the approaches.",TOPIC

This sensor can acquire contact information by interacting with the environment nonintrusively. This sensor is accompanied by a planning technique to generate exploration trajectories by using mere tactile perception. This technique relies on a hybrid policy for tactile exploration, which includes a proactive informative path planner for object searching, and a reactive Hopf oscillator for contour tracing. Results indicate that the hybrid exploration policy can increase the efficiency of object discovery. Last, scene understanding was facilitated by segmenting objects and classification. A classifier was developed to recognize the object categories based on the geometric features collected by the whisker sensor. Such an approach demonstrates the whisker sensor, together with the tactile intelligence, can provide sufficiently discriminative features to distinguish objects.",TOPIC
10.1109/TRO.2023.3306618,Deformable Object Manipulation With Constraints Using Path Set Planning and Tracking,"In robotic deformable object manipulation (DOM) applications, constraints arise commonly from environments and task-specific requirements. Enabling DOM with constraints is, therefore, crucial for its deployment in practice. However, dealing with constraints turns out to be challenging due to many inherent factors, such as inaccessible deformation models of deformable objects (DOs) and varying environmental setups. This article presents a systematic manipulation framework for DOM subject to constraints by proposing a novel path set planning and tracking scheme. First, constrained DOM tasks are formulated into a versatile optimization formalism, which enables dynamic constraint imposition. Because of the lack of the local optimization objective and high state dimensionality, the formulated problem is not analytically solvable. To address this, planning of the path set, which collects paths of DO feedback points, is proposed subsequently to offer feasible path and motion references for the DO in constrained setups. Both theoretical analyses and computationally efficient algorithmic implementation of path set planning are discussed. Lastly, a control architecture combining path set tracking and constraint handling is designed for task execution. The effectiveness of our methods is validated in a variety of DOM tasks with constrained experimental settings.",TOPIC
10.1109/TRO.2024.3392079,Neurosymbolic Motion and Task Planning for Linear Temporal Logic Tasks,"This article presents a neurosymbolic framework to solve motion planning problems for mobile robots involving temporal goals. The temporal goals are described using temporal logic formulas, such as bounded linear temporal logic (LTL) and co-safe LTL to capture complex tasks. The proposed framework trains neural network (NN)-based planners that enjoy strong correctness guarantees when applying to unseen tasks, i.e., the exact task (including workspace, temporal logic formula, and errors in the dynamical models of the robot) is not available during the training of NNs. Our approach to achieving theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency is based on two insights. First, we incorporate a symbolic model into the training of NNs such that the resulting NN-based planner inherits the interpretability and correctness guarantees of the symbolic model. Moreover, the symbolic model serves as a discrete “memory,” which is necessary for satisfying temporal logic formulas. Second, we train a library of NNs offline and combine a subset of the trained NNs into a single NN-based planner at runtime when a task is revealed. In particular, we develop a novel constrained NN training procedure, named formal NN training, to enforce that each NN in the library represents a “symbol” in the symbolic model. As a result, our neurosymbolic framework enjoys the scalability and flexibility benefits of machine learning and inherits the provable guarantees from control-theoretic and formal-methods techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in both simulations and on an actual robotic vehicle and show that our framework can generalize to unseen tasks where state-of-the-art meta-reinforcement learning techniques fail.",TOPIC

To improve the generality and effectiveness of multigripper planar grasping algorithms, we propose a grasping framework featuring gripper-agnostic scene inference and gripper-changeable optimization. In our approach, we introduce an interaction probability map that bridges the scene inference and grasp optimization modules. It efficiently decouples the learning of grasping knowledge and modeling of gripper's kinematics. The inference module adopts a modified directional ensemble method with a generated fingertip dataset to refine scene information. In grasp optimization, we formulate gripper-kinematic constraints for different grippers according to joint types. Extensive evaluations on the Cornell Grasping Dataset (with a success rate of 95.51%) and on multifingered grippers (ten grippers in the real world) demonstrate that our hybrid approach generalizes learnable knowledge across various grippers. This work enables the direct transfer of learned grasping knowledge to new grippers in real-world applications.",TOPIC

This article introduces an innovative parallel model predictive path integral (MPPI) algorithm enabling the robot to navigate swiftly and safely in such environments. Unlike the conventional MPPI methods that rely on a single sequence of Gaussian means for trajectory sampling, the proposed parallel MPPI (PMPPI) concurrently runs multiple planners with different strategies and adaptively integrates planned paths based on the current state, leveraging the advantages of different strategies and greatly improving the MPPI’s exploration capability. Moreover, a gradient-velocity modulated signed distance field (SDF) cost function that dynamically adjusts costs based on the robot’s velocity and the SDF gradient is defined, thereby promoting safer and purposeful motion planning. In the implementation, techniques like utilizing inverse kinematics solver for path guidance and sparse reward to expedite reaching time are integrated into the MPPI cost function design. Comparative evaluations against the traditional MPPI architecture and standard SDF cost designs demonstrate the superiority of the new method.

In this work, we leverage these recent results to develop a control-oriented, fully dynamic framework of slender deformable objects grasped at one end by a robotic manipulator. We introduce a dynamic model of this system using functional strain parameterizations and describe the manipulation challenge as a regulation control problem. This enables us to define a fully model-based control architecture, for which we can prove analytically closed-loop stability and provide sufficient conditions for steady state convergence to the desired state. The nature of this work is intended to be markedly experimental.

This paper designs a heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) system architecture for secondary disaster monitoring scenarios, including the follower UAV (FUAV) and the collector UAV (CUAV). Based on this architecture, a reinforcement learning-based low-delay data collection scheme (RLDC) is introduced. The scheme prioritizes the data collection from sensor nodes (SNs) with higher importance and dynamically plans the paths of UAVs to adapt to environmental changes. First, to address the challenge of data delay caused by the inability to precisely locate SNs, a path search algorithm based on fuzzy SN location is proposed. Second, to reduce data transmission delay between the FUAV and the CUAV, a load status update algorithm for FUAV is presented. Lastly, considering the dynamic changes in the importance of SNs, a bidirectional long short-term memory network multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient path planning algorithm (BMADDPG) is proposed. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the scheme can adapt to dynamic secondary geological disaster monitoring scenarios and achieve low-delay data collection from SNs.",TOPIC

In this paper, we develop an MEC-enabled AGIN architecture to serve Internet-of-Things devices. Our objective is to minimize the total energy consumption of IoTDs and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the number of dropped tasks, while maximizing the fairness index through refined access control, UAV trajectory planning, and task scheduling. Given the complexity of the optimization problem, we reformulate the problem as a Markov decision process and define the state space, the action space, the immediate reward, and the state transfer. Considering the inclusion of discrete variables, we solve the problem by devising a novel Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) based algorithm, where the continuous action outputs of MADDPG are discretized to satisfy the coupling constraints between variables. The simulation results indicate that our algorithm outperforms baseline algorithms in both convergence speed and system energy consumption. Additionally, it demonstrates exceptional stability and robustness, leading to a substantial improvement in overall system performance.",TOPIC
10.1109/UR55393.2022.9826272,"Feasibility Study of LIMMS, A Multi-Agent Modular Robotic Delivery System with Various Locomotion and Manipulation Modes","The logistics of transporting a package from a storage facility to the consumer’s front door usually employs highly specialized robots often times splitting sub-tasks up to different systems, e.g., manipulator arms to sort and wheeled vehicles to deliver. More recent endeavors attempt to have a unified approach with legged and humanoid robots. These solutions, however, occupy large amounts of space thus reducing the number of packages that can fit into a delivery vehicle. As a result, these bulky robotic systems often reduce the potential for scalability and task parallelization. In this paper, we introduce LIMMS (Latching Intelligent Modular Mobility System) to address both the manipulation and delivery portion of a typical last-mile delivery while maintaining a minimal spatial footprint. LIMMS is a symmetrically designed, 6 degree of freedom (DoF) appendage-like robot with wheels and latching mechanisms at both ends. By latching onto a surface and anchoring at one end, LIMMS can function as a traditional 6-DoF manipulator arm. On the other hand, multiple LIMMS can latch onto a single box and behave like a legged robotic system where the package is the body. During transit, LIMMS folds up compactly and takes up much less space compared to traditional robotic systems. A large group of LIMMS units can fit inside of a single delivery vehicle, opening the potential for new delivery optimization and hybrid planning methods never done before. In this paper, the feasibility of LIMMS is studied and presented using a hardware prototype as well as simulation results for a range of sub-tasks in a typical last-mile delivery.",TOPIC

Because of the high computational complexity of MAPF, several powerful techniques have been developed to reduce the runtime under assumptions, such as the ideal kinematics of point-like agents and a discretized time domain. However, these assumptions restrict the applicability of the MAPF algorithms to real-world scenarios. Continuous-time conflict-based search (CCBS), a variant of CBS, was recently proposed to generalize MAPF problems to continuous-time and non-grid domains. In this study, we propose CCBS with partitioned groups of agents (CCBS-PGA), a hybrid approach that uses CCBS as the main MAPF solver and adopts the idea of prioritized planning (PP) for enhanced scalability. CCBS-PGA runs CCBS for each group of the partitioned agents and assigns unique priorities to the individual group. We also introduce two features that reflect realistic robot kinematics; rotational velocities of robots and safety distances. This approach does not rely on the simplified assumptions while alleviating the computational complexity of MAPF problems involving numerous agents. We demonstrate its effectiveness in various environments using differential-wheeled robots.",TOPIC

By integrating Voronoi Cells with an adaptive blend of A* and Hybrid A* algorithms, the proposed combinational planner ensures the generation of feasible and executable trajectories, guaranteeing efficient and collision-free navigation of multiple agents in dynamically complex environments. An additional deadlock avoidance strategy is proposed to further enhance the safety layer. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in terms of efficiency, collision avoidance, and deadlock resolution through simulations in diverse, randomly generated environments. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of dynamic considerations and obstacle avoidance, making it a practical realtime motion planning approach for connected non-holonomic agents in complex environments.",TOPIC

State-of-the-art (SOTA) studies have applied Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) to automate MACPP, primarily focusing on minimizing task duration. However, these approaches overlook the issue of repeated node visits, resulting in longer task durations and limited real-world applicability. To tackle this challenge, we develop a novel MADRL solution, referred to as MADRL with Mask Soft Attention, to minimize task duration and node re-visiting simultaneously. Our method uses mask soft attention to extract key features from raw image observations while masking task-independent features, reducing computational complexity and improving sample efficiency. We also cascade a multi-actor-critic architecture to accommodate even more agents with ease. Each agent is equipped with an actor to learn an action policy, and a shared critic evaluates a state value. To validate our approach, we implement seven SOTA MADRL methods in the MACPP area as baselines. Simulation results show that our method significantly outperforms the baselines regarding task duration and the number of times the node is repeatedly visited.",TOPIC

However, limitation of single STAR-RIS inspire us to integrate the concept of multi-hop transmissions, as focused on RIS in existing research. Therefore, we propose the novel architecture of multi-hop STAR-RISs to achieve a wider range of full-plane service coverage. In this paper, we intend to solve active beamforming of the base station and passive beamforming of STAR-RISs, aiming for maximizing the energy efficiency constrained by hardware limitation of STAR-RISs.

Firstly, we present the detection range prediction model related to oceanic environmental parameters and propose the detection and communication scheme in UCDNs. Secondly, to conduct the cooperative environment detection mission, we formulate the CPP problem as a mixed combinatorial and sequential quadratic optimization problem to maximize the coverage ratio and minimize the path length of AUVs. To solve this problem, we investigate the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO)-based CPP scheme. In specific, the CPP problem is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Since the path planning of the AUVs is not only related to the local information but also the other AUVs' information, the information should be shared among AUVs based on the UCDNs. Furthermore, we introduce the MAPPO-based algorithm under the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture.

This study proposes path planning strategies that integrate traditional methods and intelligent algorithms for both unstructured and structured road scenarios. In unstructured roads, a bidirectional artificial potential field method combined with a fifth order Bezier curve is constructed to improve the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm framework. By using bidirectional gravitational synergy to avoid local minima, high-order curve fitting and intelligent optimization are utilized to enhance path smoothness; Structured roads adopt a hierarchical planning architecture, with the global layer generating topological paths using a hybrid A* algorithm, and the local layer achieving dynamic obstacle avoidance through Frenet coordinate system and improved deep reinforcement learning (SQDQN). The algorithm has been validated for effectiveness in simulation and real vehicle testing, with a 9.5% reduction in path length and a 75% reduction in curvature fluctuation in unstructured scenarios; The decision delay in structured scenarios has been reduced from 180ms to 102ms, and the obstacle avoidance success rate has been increased to 97.6%. By utilizing CUDA parallel computing and model lightweight design, the algorithm is ensured to meet real-time requirements on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier platform.

While various vertical applications of surgical robots offer different levels of autonomy, from complete human control to reduced levels of human input for a limited range of surgical tasks, the applications of spine surgical robots still remain at an infancy stage. Big players such as Medtronic Mazor X Stealth Edition and Globus ExcelsiousGPS mainly focus on the navigation and imaging system. Although most companies are actively exploring the possibilities of automating part or all tasks during a spine procedure, few companies have realized that at clinical or commercial stage.

10.1109/WRCSARA60131.2023.10261787,Bayesian Optimization of Double-SAC Robotic Arm Path Planning Using Recent Prioritized Experience Replay,"As for the path planning of robotic arms, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have recently been developed. However, the high-dimensional action space and state space will result in reward sparsity and low training efficiency of robotic arm path planning. We propose a Bayesian optimization of Double-SAC algorithm using recent priority experience replay to solve these issues. We first propose the sampling method of recent prioritized experience replay (RPER), which combines recent sampling and prioritized experience replay (PER). The interval of experience pool is divided according to the recent sampling method, and sampling is performed according to the sample priority of the interval. Then we adopt a Bayesian optimization method that reduces the variance of the random strategy and improve the quality of the sampled actions. The larger variance is more beneficial for exploring the environment. Smaller variance is advantageous for exploiting good experiences to obtain higher returns. Our approach finds a good balance between exploration and exploitation. We train two Soft Actor Critic (SAC) agents to obtain two independent probability distributions, and a Bayesian optimizer is adopted to combine the two distributions to design a hybrid strategy. The hybrid strategy can output better actions according to the uncertainty estimation of the distribution, and further enhance training efficiency and stability. Finally, simulation tests are performed on the ROS-Gazebo platform, and the simulation results illustrate that the algorithm proposed in this paper converges faster and has a shorter training time than the original algorithm in terms of path planning performance.",TOPIC

Motivated by the need for effective use of a robot's communication modalities, in this work, we present a computational framework that decides if, when, and what to communicate during human-robot collaboration. The framework, titled CommPlan, consists of a model specification process and an execution-time POMDP planner. To address the challenge of collecting interaction data, the model specification process is hybrid : where part of the model is learned from data, while the remainder is manually specified. Given the model, the robot's decision-making is performed computationally during interaction and under partial observability of human's mental states.

10.1145/3319502.3374832,When Humans Aren't Optimal: Robots that Collaborate with Risk-Aware Humans,"In order to collaborate safely and efficiently, robots need to anticipate how their human partners will behave. Some of today's robots model humans as if they were also robots, and assume users are always optimal. Other robots account for human limitations, and relax this assumption so that the human is noisily rational. Both of these models make sense when the human receives deterministic rewards: i.e., gaining either $100 or $130 with certainty. But in real-world scenarios, rewards are rarely deterministic. Instead, we must make choices subject to risk and uncertainty-and in these settings, humans exhibit a cognitive bias towards suboptimal behavior. For example, when deciding between gaining $100 with certainty or $130 only 80\% of the time, people tend to make the risk-averse choice-even though it leads to a lower expected gain! In this paper, we adopt a well-known Risk-Aware human model from behavioral economics called Cumulative Prospect Theory and enable robots to leverage this model during human-robot interaction (HRI). In our user studies, we offer supporting evidence that the Risk-Aware model more accurately predicts suboptimal human behavior. We find that this increased modeling accuracy results in safer and more efficient human-robot collaboration. Overall, we extend existing rational human models so that collaborative robots can anticipate and plan around suboptimal human behavior during HRI.",TOPIC

Access to the Web and underlying Internet is seen as essential for all—even a fundamental human right [7]. However, many contend that the power structure on large swaths of the Web has become inverted; they argue that instead of being run for and by users, it has been made to serve the platforms themselves, and the powerful actors that sponsor such platforms to run targeted advertising on their behalf. In such an ad-driven platform ecosystem, users, including their beliefs, data, and attention, have become traded commodities [13].There is concern that the emergence of powerful data analytics and AI techniques threaten to further entrench the power of these same platforms, by putting the control of powerful and valuable new capabilities in their hands rather than the users who produce the data [10]. The fear is that it is giving rise to data and AI monopolies [2,6]. Individuals have no long-term control or agency over their personal data or many of the decisions made using it.This may be one reason we are witnessing a so called Renaissance of Ethics - a plethora of initiatives and activities that call out the range of threats to individual autonomy, self-determination and privacy, the lack of transparency and accountability, a concern around bias and fairness, equity and access in our data driven ecosystem. This keynote will argue as the remaining half of the world's population comes online, we need digital infrastructures that will promote a plurality of methods of data sovereignty and governance instead of imposing a ’single policy fits-all’ platform governance model, which has strained and undermined the ability for governments to protect and support their citizens digital rights.This is an opportunity to re-imagine and re-architect elements of the Web, data, algorithms and institutions so as to ensure a more equitable distribution of these new digital potentialities. Based on our existing research we have been developing methods and tech-nologies pertaining to the following core principles: informational self-determination and autonomy, balanced and equitable access to AI and data, accountability and redress of AI/algorithmic decisions, and new models of ethical participation and contribution.The technology that underpins the modern web has seen exponential rates of change that have continuously improved the capabilities of the processors, memory and communications upon which it depends. This has enabled huge amounts of data to be linked and stored as well as providing for increasing use of AI. A variety of projects will be described where we sought to unlock the potential of this increasingly powerful infrastructure [1, 4, 5, 9]. The lessons learnt through various efforts to develop the Seman-tic Web [8] and the insights gained through the release of open data at scale will be reviewed [11]. We will review our attempts to understand how the blending of humans, algorithms and data at scale results in social machines whose emergent properties results in behaviour and problem solving which any of the individual elements would not have been able to achieve [12]. Understanding these emergent properties of the web was one of the motivating factors behind the establishment of Web Science [3]. We will briefly review the prospects for Web Science.The importance of data as infrastructure to enable wide spread innovation, accountability and trusted reproducible science will be stressed. Recent work will be described that seeks to promote an equitable and balanced Web environment in which privacy can be upheld and better mutualities realised. Developments in technical and institutional architectures that could underpin an Ethical Web of data will be outlined.",TOPIC
10.1145/3369759,Parallel Data Distribution Management on Shared-memory Multiprocessors,"The problem of identifying intersections between two sets of d-dimensional axis-parallel rectangles appears frequently in the context of agent-based simulation studies. For this reason, the High Level Architecture (HLA) specification—a standard framework for interoperability among simulators—includes a Data Distribution Management (DDM) service whose responsibility is to report all intersections between a set of subscription and update regions. The algorithms at the core of the DDM service are CPU-intensive, and could greatly benefit from the large computing power of modern multi-core processors. In this article, we propose two parallel solutions to the DDM problem that can operate effectively on shared-memory multiprocessors. The first solution is based on a data structure (the interval tree) that allows concurrent computation of intersections between subscription and update regions. The second solution is based on a novel parallel extension of the Sort Based Matching algorithm, whose sequential version is considered among the most efficient solutions to the DDM problem. Extensive experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms confirm their effectiveness on taking advantage of multiple execution units in a shared-memory architecture.",TOPIC

This paper is to investigate the accuracy of two methods to detect Pulmonary Tuberculosis based on the patient chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Various image preprocessing methods are tested to find the combination that yields the highest accuracy. Moreover, a hybrid approach using the original statistical computer-aided detection method combined with Neural Networks was also investigated. Simulations have been carried out based on 406 normal images \&amp; 394 abnormal images. The simulations show that a cropped region of interest coupled with contrast enhancement yields excellent results. When further enhancing the images with the hybrid method even better results are achieved.",TOPIC

Nowadays, new gadgets and devices are bringing innovative solutions to make problems simplified and effortless in our daily life. So, the innovation of an autonomous dust sweeper bot can make cleaning tasks effortless and user-friendly. For the last few years, self-directed cleaners have taken major attention by providing customer satisfaction because of its usefulness in helping humans by minimizing physical effort in day to day cleaning purposes. Consequently, a new type of vacuum cleaner bot is implemented by using local resources which can solve the dust problem automatically. One of the additional features of this vacuum cleaner bot is its running capability using a hybrid plugin/solar energy. This bot can repeatedly keep clean places like industries, hospitals, and universities. This bot follows a predetermined line in automatic mode or can be controlled by a joystick. This structure also can detect obstacles on its following path to avoid accidents. It has the charging capability using solar radiation or can be charged from the mains during cloudy days. It collects dust by its cyclone separator vacuum cleaner \& cleaning brush, which is designed for the first time by our team. This bot is designed to run on ultra-low power (only 80 W), whereas the lowest power of a conventional vacuum cleaner in the market is around 1800W.Finally, we can say that this renewable energy-driven smart cyclone separator vacuum cleaner bot is the finest bot that can solve the dust problem by itself. It has far-reaching potential to be the best commercial product in the cleaning era with the assurance of a healthy environment.",TOPIC

Most research has focused on a subset of combinations to determine the link between facial configurations and emotions. Despite the value of this research for psychological and computational reasons, it is not clear what the most common combinations of AUs are to form the most commonly expressed facial configurations. We used three diverse corpora with human coded facial action units for a computational analysis. The analysis demonstrated that the largest portion of facial behavior consists of the absence of AU activations, yielding only one specific facial configuration, that of the neutral face. These results are important for cognitive scientists, computer graphics designers and virtual human developers alike. They suggest that only a relatively small number of AU combinations are initially needed for the creation of natural facial behavior in Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs).",TOPIC

The main advantages of MSA include modularization and scalability. However, the development and maintenance of Microservice-based systems are more complex than traditional monolithic architecture. This research plans to develop a novel Chatbot system, referred to as MSABot (Microservice Architecture Bot), to assist in the development and operation of Microservice-based systems by using Chatbots. MSABot integrates a variety of tools to allow users to understand the current status of Microservice development and operation, and to push the information of system errors or risks to users. For the operators who take over the maintenance of Microservices, MSABot also allows them to quickly understand the overall service architecture and the operation status of each service.

GAs have been used successfully in a variety of path planning problem because they can search the space of all possible paths and provide the optimal one. The convergence process of GAs might be lengthy compared to traditional search techniques that depend on local search methods. We propose a hybrid approach that allows GAs to combine both the advantages of GAs and local search algorithms. GAs will create a multiple waypoint path allowing a mobile robot to navigate through static obstacles and finding the optimal path in order to approach the target location without collision. The proposed NSGAs has been examined over four different path planning case studies with varying complexity. The performance of the enhanced GA has been compared with A-star algorithm (A*) standard GA, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The obtained results show that the proposed approach is able to get good results compared to other algorithms.",TOPIC
10.1145/3392858,C-Reference: Improving 2D to 3D Object Pose Estimation Accuracy via Crowdsourced Joint Object Estimation,"Converting widely-available 2D images and videos, captured using an RGB camera, to 3D can help accelerate the training of machine learning systems in spatial reasoning domains ranging from in-home assistive robots to augmented reality to autonomous vehicles. However, automating this task is challenging because it requires not only accurately estimating object location and orientation, but also requires knowing currently unknown camera properties (e.g., focal length). A scalable way to combat this problem is to leverage people's spatial understanding of scenes by crowdsourcing visual annotations of 3D object properties. Unfortunately, getting people to directly estimate 3D properties reliably is difficult due to the limitations of image resolution, human motor accuracy, and people's 3D perception (i.e., humans do not ""see"" depth like a laser range finder). In this paper, we propose a crowd-machine hybrid approach that jointly uses crowds' approximate measurements of multiple in-scene objects to estimate the 3D state of a single target object. Our approach can generate accurate estimates of the target object by combining heterogeneous knowledge from multiple contributors regarding various different objects that share a spatial relationship with the target object. We evaluate our joint object estimation approach with 363 crowd workers and show that our method can reduce errors in the target object's 3D location estimation by over 40\%, while requiring only $35$\% as much human time. Our work introduces a novel way to enable groups of people with different perspectives and knowledge to achieve more accurate collective performance on challenging visual annotation tasks.",TOPIC

This article introduces the kinematics, motion planning and collision detection algorithms and our accelerators in robotics, and then analyzes their advantages, disadvantages and bottlenecks. In view of the shortcomings of the existing accelerators, this paper will show a series accelerators named ""DaDu"" that we have proposed. For kinematics, we have proposed Dadu [1] to accelerate the inverse kinematics algorithm, which achieves 1700x speedup than the CPU implementation, 30x speedup than the GPU implementation, and 776x higher energy efficiency than the GPU implementation. For motion planning, we have proposed Dadu-P [2] to accelerate the PRM algorithm. It can get 26.5x speedup than an existing CPU-based approach for collision detection. Furthermore, with an incremental approach, the performance of motion planning can further be improved by 10x while the solution quality is degraded by 10\% only.

10.1145/3404555.3404639,Urban Driving Based on Condition Imitation Learning and Multi-Period Information Fusion,"In recent years, autonomous driving has become a hot topic, especially in the complex urban road environment. The visual algorithm is the most used scheme for autonomous driving. The traditional condition imitation learning adopts the end-to-end deep learning network. But it lacks interpretability, and the ability of feature extraction and expression of network is limited. There are still some problems in the local planning and detail implementation. To solve these problems, we propose to use the deep residual network architecture and add the dual attention module to learn driving skills, which are closer to human beings. To further improve the detailed feature extraction ability of the network, the deeper residual network architecture is used. To adaptively integrate the global context long-range dependence of the image in the spatial and feature dimensions, the dual attention module is adopted to improve the ability of network expression. At the same time, in order to make full use of the multi-period attribute information of the camera image itself, we redesign the network architecture, extract, integrate the three-way temporal information features and the high-level semantics, and increase the interpretability of the temporal information of the model. This method is tested on the CARLA simulator. The experimental results show that compared with the benchmark algorithm, it achieves better driving effect. Deeper feature extraction and multi-period information fusion can effectively improve the driving ability and driving completion of the agent.",TOPIC

Unfortunately, studies conducted in 2015 and 2017 have shown that the web portals of many federal agencies, including those with ministry status, failed to fully comply with the current legislation in many aspects. The aim of this paper is to re-evaluate the web portals of the Brazilian Federal Ministries to assess how much they evolved since 2015 concerning their compliance with the Brazilian Accessibility Model (e-MAG); usage of the Digital Government Identity; publication of the Circumstantial Report and Accessibility Work Plan; and usage of recommended Content Management Systems. The results of our evaluation show that compliance with the e-MAG standard with ratings based on the different types of guidelines violated slightly improved, but the number of instances of violations of guidelines significantly dropped; the usage of the Digital Government Identity has increased satisfactorily as well as the usage of recommended tools for developing and maintaining web portals; and only few web portals published the Circumstantial Report and Accessibility Work Plan.",TOPIC

How Beliefs Shape Twitter Profile Perceptions,"In this paper, we investigate the human ability to distinguish political social bots from humans on Twitter. Following motivated reasoning theory from social and cognitive psychology, our central hypothesis is that especially those accounts which are opinion-incongruent are perceived as social bot accounts when the account is ambiguous about its nature. We also hypothesize that credibility ratings mediate this relationship. We asked N = 151 participants to evaluate 24 Twitter accounts and decide whether the accounts were humans or social bots. Findings support our motivated reasoning hypothesis for a sub-group of Twitter users (those who are more familiar with Twitter): Accounts that are opinion-incongruent are evaluated as relatively more bot-like than accounts that are opinion-congruent. Moreover, it does not matter whether the account is clearly social bot or human or ambiguous about its nature. This was mediated by perceived credibility in the sense that congruent profiles were evaluated to be more credible resulting in lower perceptions as bots.",TOPIC

CAs support coordination and planning between the two, and can amplify the support that the care partner needs to provide. In this study, we observed how ten such dyads interacted with a Google Home over 10 weeks. We logged and analyzed 3,878 total interactions, interviewed the dyads to better understand their experiences, and also surveyed their individual preferences and priorities for automated assistance in the home. We found that CAs empowered both the people who had MCI, and their care partners.

While previous work focuses on analyzing player perception of agency through various lenses and phenomena, like meaningful choice and expectations, it is largely theoretical. Few user studies within games explore how players reason about and judge their own agency within interactive narratives. We present an interview study where participants rated their agency experiences within narrative-focused games and described their reasoning. The analysis suggests that agency perception depends on multiple factors beyond meaningful choice, such as social investment and genre-conventions. Participants described varying preferences and value judgements for different factors, indicating that individual differences have a deep impact on agency perception in narrative-focused gameplay. We discuss the implications of these cognitive variables on design, how they can be leveraged with other factors, and how our findings can help future work enhance and measure player agency, within interactive narrative and beyond.",TOPIC

An emerging concept is creative learning, which attempts to understand, experiment, and define methodologies and learning environments designed to promote creativity. Enaction theorists, a new thread of cognitive science, understand that cognition and creativity always emerge through real-time interaction with the environment and other agents in that environment. Socioenactive systems are extensions to the enactive system concept, bringing attention to socio-cultural values in the dynamic coupling of the human (through the body senses) and technology. This work aims to explore and understand the creative process of preschool children during their interaction with a tangible programming environment (TaPrEC+mBot) that allows programming of a robot car by arranging wooden blocks. The analysis draws on the physical, digital, and social dimensions of socioenactive systems. The results show that the children felt especially involved through their bodies and engaged in the activity of creating their own programming scenario. They also suggest that the children's reasoning and behavior seem to be connected or influenced by their body movements and their physical, social and digital experience and interaction with the tangible programming environment.",TOPIC
10.1145/3426425.3426942,Behavior trees in action: a study of robotics applications,"Autonomous robots combine a variety of skills to form increasingly complex behaviors called missions. While the skills are often programmed at a relatively low level of abstraction, their coordination is architecturally separated and often expressed in higher-level languages or frameworks. Recently, the language of Behavior Trees gained attention among roboticists for this reason. Originally designed for computer games to model autonomous actors, Behavior Trees offer an extensible tree-based representation of missions. However, even though, several implementations of the language are in use, little is known about its usage and scope in the real world. How do behavior trees relate to traditional languages for describing behavior? How are behavior tree concepts used in applications? What are the benefits of using them?  We present a study of the key language concepts in Behavior Trees and their use in real-world robotic applications. We identify behavior tree languages and compare their semantics to the most well-known behavior modeling languages: state and activity diagrams. We mine open source repositories for robotics applications that use the language and analyze this usage. We find that Behavior Trees are a pragmatic language, not fully specified, allowing projects to extend it even for just one model. Behavior trees clearly resemble the models-at-runtime paradigm. We contribute a dataset of real-world behavior models, hoping to inspire the community to use and further develop this language, associated tools, and analysis techniques.",TOPIC

10.1145/3428300,Koord: a language for programming and verifying distributed robotics application,"A robot’s code needs to sense the environment, control the hardware, and communicate with other robots. Current programming languages do not provide suitable abstractions that are independent of hardware platforms. Currently, developing robot applications requires detailed knowledge of signal processing, control, path planning, network protocols, and various platform-specific details. Further, porting applications across hardware platforms remains tedious. We present Koord—a domain specific language for distributed robotics—which abstracts platform-specific functions for sensing, communication, and low-level control. Koord makes the platform-independent control and coordination code portable and modularly verifiable. Koord raises the level of abstraction in programming by providing distributed shared memory for coordination and port interfaces for sensing and control. We have developed the formal executable semantics of Koord in the K framework. With this symbolic execution engine, we can identify assumptions (proof obligations) needed for gaining high assurance from Koord applications. We illustrate the power of Koord through three applications: formation flight, distributed delivery, and distributed mapping. We also use the three applications to demonstrate how platform-independent proof obligations can be discharged using the Koord Prover while platform-specific proof obligations can be checked by verifying the obligations using physics-based models and hybrid verification tools.",TOPIC

Furthermore, we have asked them for what reasons they are willing to grant them those rights. Finally, we have administered general perceptions of robots regarding appearance, capacities, and traits. Results show that rights can be divided in sociopolitical and computing dimensions, and reasons into cognition and compassion dimensions. People generally have a positive view on robot interaction capacities. Attitudes towards robot rights depend on age and experience as well as on the cognitive and affective capacities people believe robots will ever possess.

In a complicated and dynamic environment, planning efficiency is crucial. In this paper, we propose a hybrid path planning scheme for a differentially driven wheeled robot with dynamical constraints by combining global path planning and local hierarchical architectures in a complex dynamic environment. In path planning under the hybrid structure, first, we generate a global path based on the adaptive goal-directed RRT algorithm. This way can achieve Efficiency. Local path planning uses the DWA with PID controller instead of the cost function for real-time motion control. A seamless interface between the global and local path planning mechanisms is designed to contribute to the whole hybrid path planning scheme. Finally, the experimental results on the grid map prove the potency and feasibility of our method.",TOPIC

Finally, the model which has been developed was simulated, and it was compared and analyzed with the rigid system. The results show that the rules of the energy variation of the new model are similar to general rigid system. Therefore it can be applied to the same applicable situation.

To address the issue, this paper proposes a computational approach that hybridizing a GA with the reinforcement learning (RL) technology. The benefit is that we no longer need to re-execute the GA for each new request arrived.

This problem is typically formulated as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. Today's practice relies on hand-tuned heuristics from human experts to address the scalability challenge of ILP solvers.In this paper, we propose NeuroPlan, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to solve the network planning problem. This problem involves multi-step decision making and cost minimization, which can be naturally cast as a deep RL problem. We develop two important domain-specific techniques. First, we use a graph neural network (GNN) and a novel domain-specific node-link transformation for state encoding, in order to handle the dynamic nature of the evolving network topology during planning decision making. Second, we leverage a two-stage hybrid approach that first uses deep RL to prune the search space and then uses an ILP solver to find the optimal solution. This approach resembles today's practice, but avoids human experts with an RL agent in the first stage. Evaluation on real topologies and setups from large production networks demonstrates that NeuroPlan scales to large topologies beyond the capability of ILP solvers, and reduces the cost by up to 17\% compared to hand-tuned heuristics.",TOPIC

A specific and significant example are robotic devices for rehabilitation. Despite this, an effective standardized and comprehensive method to assess force control performance does not exist. Defining the performance of a force-controlled system is not a trivial task, and one of the reasons is that performance does not only depend on the dynamics of the robot, but also on the dynamics of the environment, which are usually uncertain and time-varying. Exerting a force on a soft environment is different from exerting a force on a rigid environment. Indeed, the same force-controlled robot can have different force responses in different environments. This paper proposes a methodology to standardize the benchmarking of force control algorithms applied to different actuation architectures and considering a wide set of possible environments and disturbances, defined by the application of interest.",TOPIC
10.1145/3459104.3459125,Development of a Hybrid Control Algorithm Based on Neural Networks for Mobile Autonomous Robot Navigation,"A control algorithm based on adaptive neural networks is developed to control the navigation of a mobile autonomous ground-based explorer robot. A simulation was performed in the Matlab program to verify the operation of the algorithm, where the set of proximity sensors used by the robot for the detection and evasion of obstacles was simulated.The algorithm was developed using three neural network architectures: Adaline-type linear adaptive network, Perceptron neural network, and Feedforward neural network. The mathematical study of each of the adaptive neural network architectures proposed for the recognition of training patterns, corresponding to wall following patterns was carried out; their comparison was made and based on the results of the simulation, the one that showed the best output responses was selected to form part of the algorithm.This algorithm is in charged of the main tasks of obstacle avoidance and the target searching, generating as control outputs: the angle of rotation of the robot concerning its current position and its forward speed, to solve the problem of high difficulty concave obstacles encountered in the robot's path to the target. This is a hybrid algorithm, made up of a local path planning algorithm, in charge of obstacle wall fallowing and a global path planning algorithm, in charge of finding the final objective.This work focused on solving the problem of evasion of high difficulty concave obstacles, formed by curves in the form of a loop, also called dead-end traps, in which a situation of local minimum is presented. In this work different types of obstacles were simulated, being able to create almost any shape; the algorithm was tested with obstacles created from arrays of bars or lines forming simple corners, with obstacles such as U-shaped, snail-shaped, labyrinth-shaped, among other complicated shapes.The developed algorithm autonomously generates an obstacle-free navigation path, with a speed control of the robot, during the entire movement until reaching the final target.Besides, the simulation shows that the designed algorithm works adequately to solve the problem of concave obstacles, and compared with results of other mobile robot navigation techniques such as potential fields, diffuse controller-based techniques, and techniques based on rule learning (pure neural network); that in general, they present great limitations to solve the type of problem posed, difficult concave-type obstacles, remaining stuck in local minima or entering into infinite cycles with no exit, without reaching the final target; therefore, the robustness of the developed algorithm is shown.",TOPIC
10.1145/3459996,Tactile Perception for Teleoperated Robotic Exploration within Granular Media,"The sense of touch is essential for locating buried objects when vision-based approaches are limited. We present an approach for tactile perception when sensorized robot fingertips are used to directly interact with granular media particles in teleoperated systems. We evaluate the effects of linear and nonlinear classifier model architectures and three tactile sensor modalities (vibration, internal fluid pressure, fingerpad deformation) on the accuracy of estimates of fingertip contact state. We propose an architecture called the Sparse-Fusion Recurrent Neural Network (SF-RNN) in which sparse features are autonomously extracted prior to fusing multimodal tactile data in a fully connected RNN input layer. The multimodal SF-RNN model achieved 98.7\% test accuracy and was robust to modest variations in granular media type and particle size, fingertip orientation, fingertip speed, and object location. Fingerpad deformation was the most informative modality for haptic exploration within granular media while vibration and internal fluid pressure provided additional information with appropriate signal processing. We introduce a real-time visualization of tactile percepts for remote exploration by constructing a belief map that combines probabilistic contact state estimates and fingertip location. The belief map visualizes the probability of an object being buried in the search region and could be used for planning.",TOPIC
10.1145/3461702.3462520,Alienation in the AI-Driven Workplace,"This paper asks whether explanations of one's workplace and economic institutions are valuable in and of themselves. In doing so, it departs from much of the explainability literature in law, computer science, philosophy, and the social sciences, which examine the instrumental values that explainable AI has: explainable systems increase accountability and user trust, or reduce the risk of harm due to increased robustness. Think, however, of how you might feel if you went to your local administrative agency to apply for some benefit, or you were handed down a decision by a judge in a court. Let's stipulate that you know that the decision was just, even though neither the civil servant nor the judge explain to you why the decision was made, and you don't know the relevant rules; you just brought all the information you had about yourself, and hoped for the best. Is such a decision process defective? I argue that such a decision process is defective because it prevents individuals from accessing the normative explanations that are necessary to form an appropriate practical orientation towards their social world. A practical orientation is a reflective stance towards one's social world, which is expressed in one's actions and draws on one's cognitive architecture that allows one to navigate the various social practices and institutions. A practical orientation can range from rejection to silent endorsement, and is the sort of attitude for which there are the right kind of reasons, based in the world's normative character. It also determines how one fills out one's role obligations, and, more broadly, guides one's actions in the relevant institution: a teacher in the American South during the time of enforced racial segregation, for example, might choose where to teach on the basis of her rejection of the segregation of education. To form an appropriate practical orientation, one must have an understanding of the social world's normative character, which required a normative explanation And, since we spend so much of our lives at work and are constrained by economic institutions, we must understand their structure and how they function.",TOPIC

Supervisors strive to help. Yet heavy workloads frequently prevent tutors from continuous involvement. This article looks into the extent to which conversational agents (a.k.a. chatbots) can tackle procrastination in single-student capstone projects. Specifically, chatbot enablers put in play include (1) alerts, (2) advice, (3) automatic rescheduling, (4) motivational messages, and (5) reference to previous capstone projects. Informed by Cognitive Behavioural Theory, these enablers are framed within the three phases involved in self-regulation misalignment: pre-actional, actional, and post-actional. To motivate this research, we first analyzed 77 capstone-project reports. We found that students’ Gantt charts (1) fail to acknowledge review meetings (70\%) and milestones (100\%) and (2) suffer deviations from the initial planned effort (16.28\%). On these grounds, we develop GanttBot, a Telegram chatbot that is configured from the student’s Gantt diagram. GanttBot reminds students about close landmarks, it informs tutors when intervention might be required, and it learns from previous projects about common pitfalls, advising students accordingly. For evaluation purposes, course 17/18 acts as the control group ( N=28 ) while course 18/19 acts as the treatment group ( N=25  students). Using “overdue days” as the proxy for procrastination, results indicate that course 17/18 accounted for an average of 19 days of delay (SD = 5), whereas these days go down to 10 for the intervention group in course 18/19 (SD = 4). GanttBot is available for public usage as a Telegram chatbot.",TOPIC

However, judging from the current situation, most of the distance teaching systems have shortcomings in design. They only digitize the existing teaching models and existing teaching materials and move them to the Internet, which makes the system lacks intelligence and adaptability. It is difficult to provide personalized learning guidance for students' learning differences, and the quality of distance teaching cannot be well guaranteed. This paper proposes an intelligent teaching model based on Bayesian network and multi-agent technology. The teaching model can be different from person to person to formulate and implement guidance strategies, actively collect the most interesting information for learners through the intelligent agent proxy server, and automatically generate various questions and exercises. At the same time, the model uses agent communication protocol to process information through reasonable planning and adjustment of learning content and progress, and allows users to browse. The system can predict user needs, actively formulate learning plans, adjust learning progress, and diagnose learning progress. Problems and errors make them more in line with the learner's knowledge base and cognitive characteristics. Therefore, the teaching model has a certain pertinence and forward-looking.",TOPIC

New types of digital technologies have emerged into the human mindscape, and with that a new potential for bridging human understanding and multispecies geographies. Emphasising the agency of plants, this paper attempts to answer the following research questions: how can twenty-first-century media technologies, such as media architecture, be used to better incorporate plant/flora perspectives? This paper begins by providing a review of multispecies ontology, exploration of plant agency and how media architecture can visualise and amplify plant agency based on Whitehead's Process Philosophy, Mark Hansen's Feed-Forward concept and Feenberg's technical agency framework. Hortum Machina B, terra0, and Elowan are explored as three examples of Plant(e)tecture where the multispecies actors “plants'' are coupled with technologies and analysed for agency and autonomy. Synthesising the three case studies, the paper discusses the role of media architecture in (i) enabling plant agency; (ii) engaging multispecies actors in autonomous decision-making, and; (iii) the creation of technology to amplify the agency of plants in a design process that transcends human sensibilities. The paper closes on the prospect of the multispecies-techno agency framework to enable human designers, makers, decision-makers and thinkers to move beyond human-centric determinism prevalent in media architecture. The framework offers new ways of thinking of the purpose of technical agency in multispecies assemblages.",TOPIC

It is an expository work targeted to uncover lack of access to Primary Health Care Services (PHCS) which has consistently posed serious health risks in Nigerian society, especially in rural areas, where health facilities are largely inadequate or absent in extreme cases. COVID-19 has played an important role in disclosing lapses of health facilities in most countries around the world and Nigeria is not an exception. Therefore, it takes cognizance of the mother and child health, pre and post antenatal well-being. Previous studies examination indicated that about one in every six children dies before age five in Nigeria. This suggests that improved access to adequate health care holds great potential for improved child survival. However, there has not been an enough systematic attempt to examine the effects of these barriers to health care on under-five mortality in Nigerian rural areas. This study is designed to address this knowledge gap. Method and materials: Online survey monkey tool (OSMT) aims to collect data and measure accuracy performance for proper feedback was employed. A structured questionnaire was used to send across 107 pregnant women in some rural areas in Nigeria for a period of one month and 2 weeks and they responded through emails, Facebook etc. due to Covid-19 protocol and restrictions. A total of 67 persons responded. Their feedback was processed, analyzed and presented in graphics. Objective: To ascertain the health situation of mother and child in Nigerian rural communities and the other prevalence factors influencing access to primary health care services. Results and discussion- We found 95.52\% respondents align with the fact that health of the mothers and children is a public health priority, 79.10\% agreed that progress in newborn health does not require expansive technology. 83.82\% subscribed to the idea that an urgent need is required t develop effective ways to organizing continuity of care during those first weeks after birth etc. Conclusion: Findings of this study stressed the need for improved access to adequate health care in rural areas through the elimination of barriers to access and education awareness. This study would enable health agencies and planners in the country to achieve a significant reduction in childhood and mother mortality in the long run.",TOPIC
10.1145/3477314.3507270,Rating consistency is consistently underrated: an exploratory analysis of movie-tag rating inconsistency,"Content-based and hybrid recommender systems rely on item-tag ratings to make recommendations. An example of an item-tag rating is the degree to which the tag ""comedy"" applies to the movie ""Back to the Future (1985)"". Ratings are often generated by human annotators who can be inconsistent with one another. However, many recommender systems take item-tag ratings at face value, assuming them all to be equally valid. In this paper, we investigate the inconsistency of item-tag ratings together with contextual factors that could affect consistency in the movie domain. We conducted semi-structured interviews to identify potential reasons for rating inconsistency. Next, we used these reasons to design a survey, which we ran on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We collected 6,070 ratings from 665 annotators across 142 movies and 80 tags. Our analysis shows that ~45\% of ratings are inconsistent with the mode rating for a given movie-tag pair. We found that the single most important factor for rating inconsistency is the annotator's perceived ease of rating, suggesting that annotators are at least tacitly aware of the quality of their own ratings. We also found that subjective tags (e.g. ""funny"", ""boring"") are more inconsistent than objective tags (e.g. ""robots"", ""aliens""), and are associated with lower tag familiarity and lower perceived ease of rating.",TOPIC

A safe range for pure tensile load has been estimated using FEM simulation to confirm usability in prototyping. Three modules have been designed to produce active, passive, and joint locking functionalities in the revolute joints and the fourth connectivity module helps to achieve the connectivity in between revolute joints of different linkages. It has been shown by developing the prototype for two different complex planer hybrid manipulators as examples, that these modules work as tools for the designer to design a customized manipulator. CAD modelling has been used for preparing a complete manipulator structure which, using AM, can be given the physical form.In the design and manufacturing of robotic manipulators, incorporating modular libraries makes the design customizable as well as makes the process easier. With this approach, the user follows a drag and drop approach to customize a design using an already available set of modular components fulfilling different purposes. Further work will demonstrate the technique by preparing models some randomly selected linkages based upon the designed modules.",TOPIC
10.1145/3488241,Stop Ignoring Me! On Fighting the Trivialization of Social Robots in Public Spaces,"Service and social robot in public scenarios will face various tasks in future applications, such as guiding people or admonishing them to provide assistance or convey social norms. Robots in public spaces might also incorporate roles of authority figures who might admonish people (e.g., security or guard robots). However, recent investigations showed that people ignore the admonishment of robots. Thus, in this work, we are looking at the reasons why people might ignore robots based on the Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT). We present the results of two consecutive field observations where a robot admonishes participants (i.e., pedestrians in a shopping mall) and requests them to stop using a smartphone while walking, which is considered an unmoral behavior. In the first field observation, we approached 160 participants over four days and conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 of them. Approximately half of the people ignored the robot, and half of them followed the instructions. Our interview results show that people who ignore the robot indeed use trivialization as a cognitive dissonance reduction strategy to justify ignoring the robot. Based on our analysis of the results, we developed a counter-trivialization strategy that anticipates this dissonance reduction strategy. We admonished 167 participants in our second field observation over four days, and our results show that significantly fewer people ignore the instructions of the robot when the robot uses a counter-trivialization strategy.",TOPIC
10.1145/3491102.3501992,Rediscovering Affordance: A Reinforcement Learning Perspective,"Affordance refers to the perception of possible actions allowed by an object. Despite its relevance to human–computer interaction, no existing theory explains the mechanisms that underpin affordance-formation; that is, how affordances are discovered and adapted via interaction. We propose an integrative theory of affordance-formation based on the theory of reinforcement learning in cognitive sciences. The key assumption is that users learn to associate promising motor actions to percepts via experience when reinforcement signals (success/failure) are present. They also learn to categorize actions (e.g., “rotating” a dial), giving them the ability to name and reason about affordance. Upon encountering novel widgets, their ability to generalize these actions determines their ability to perceive affordances. We implement this theory in a virtual robot model, which demonstrates human-like adaptation of affordance in interactive widgets tasks. While its predictions align with trends in human data, humans are able to adapt affordances faster, suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms.",TOPIC

Aiming at the problem that the amplitude of angular velocity and angular acceleration of 3-5-3 hybrid polynomial interpolation algorithm is too high, a 3-3-5 hybrid polynomial interpolation trajectory planning method is proposed. Firstly, the D-H (Denavit-Hartenberg) model of the rail inspection robot is used to compute its kinematics equation. Secondly, according to the constraints of motion curve (angle, angular velocity, angular acceleration continuous), kinematics constraints are obtained and interpolation points are determined. Thirdly, the coefficient expression of the hybrid polynomial interpolation algorithm is solved by substituting kinematics constraints and interpolation points into the formula of the 3-3-5 hybrid polynomial interpolation algorithm. Finally, the 3-3-5 hybrid polynomial interpolation algorithm is simulated in MATLAB. The results show that the 3-3-5 hybrid polynomial interpolation algorithm can effectively reduce the amplitude of the angular velocity and angular acceleration, reduce the jerk of the motor, and improve the overall motion performance of the inspection robot.",TOPIC
10.1145/3503161.3547886,Dilated Context Integrated Network with Cross-Modal Consensus for Temporal Emotion Localization in Videos,"Understanding human emotions is a crucial ability for intelligent robots to provide better human-robot interactions. The existing works are limited to trimmed video-level emotion classification, failing to locate the temporal window corresponding to the emotion. In this paper, we introduce a new task, named Temporal Emotion Localization in videos (TEL), which aims to detect human emotions and localize their corresponding temporal boundaries in untrimmed videos with aligned subtitles. TEL presents three unique challenges compared to temporal action localization: 1) The emotions have extremely varied temporal dynamics; 2) The emotion cues are embedded in both appearances and complex plots; 3) The fine-grained temporal annotations are complicated and labor-intensive. To address the first two challenges, we propose a novel dilated context integrated network with a coarse-fine two-stream architecture. The coarse stream captures varied temporal dynamics by modeling multi-granularity temporal contexts. The fine stream achieves complex plots understanding by reasoning the dependency between the multi-granularity temporal contexts from the coarse stream and adaptively integrates them into fine-grained video segment features. To address the third challenge, we introduce a cross-modal consensus learning paradigm, which leverages the inherent semantic consensus between the aligned video and subtitle to achieve weakly-supervised learning. We contribute a new testing set with 3,000 manually-annotated temporal boundaries so that future research on the TEL problem can be quantitatively evaluated. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our approach on temporal emotion localization.

10.1145/3503510,A Workflow Architecture for Cloud-based Distributed Simulation,"Distributed Simulation has still to be adopted significantly by the wider simulation community. Reasons for this might be that distributed simulation applications are difficult to develop and access to multiple computing resources are required. Cloud computing offers low-cost on-demand computing resources. Developing applications that can use cloud computing can be also complex, particularly those that can run on different clouds. Cloud-based Distributed Simulation (CBDS) is potentially attractive, as it may solve the computing resources issue as well as other cloud benefits, such as convenient network access. However, as possibly shown by the lack of sustainable approaches in the literature, the combination of cloud and distributed simulation may be far too complex to develop a general approach. E-Infrastructures have emerged as large-scale distributed systems that support high-performance computing in various scientific fields. Workflow Management Systems (WMS) have been created to simplify the use of these e-Infrastructures. There are many examples of where both technologies have been extended to use cloud computing. This article therefore presents our investigation into the potential of using these technologies for CBDS in the above context and the WORkflow architecture for cLoud-based Distributed Simulation (WORLDS), our contribution to CBDS. We present an implementation of WORLDS using the CloudSME Simulation Platform that combines the WS-PGRADE/gUSE WMS with the CloudBroker Platform as a Service. The approach is demonstrated with a case study using an agent-based distributed simulation of an Emergency Medical Service in REPAST and the Portico HLA RTI on the Amazon EC2 cloud.",TOPIC

Adequate knowledge of the atmospheric temperature of an environment is therefore essential for radio wave propagation planning. In this study, thirty-four (34)-year (1981-2014) atmospheric temperature data of 10 selected weather stations across the climatic zones of Nigeria, obtained from the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET) through the data bank of the West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adaptive Land Use (WASCAL) of the Federal University of Technology Minna, Nigeria was used in Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the prediction of mean monthly atmospheric temperature. The ANN architecture comprised of 2 inputs (the climatic zones and the corresponding month for the mean monthly atmospheric temperature), 1 hidden layer and 1 output (atmospheric temperature). Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was used with 9 different pairs of activation functions formed from 3 activation functions (logsig, purelin and tansig). The number of neurons in the hidden layer was varied from 33-39 with an increasing steps of 2 (33, 35, 37 and 39). The network architecture of 2-37-1 (2 inputs, 37 neurons in the hidden layer and 1 output), with tansig/tansig pair of activation functions had the least mean square error value of 2.2280, and was used for the prediction process. The computed correlation values for measured and predicted atmospheric temperature ranged from 0.9733 to 0.8787, depicting strong positive correlation and good accuracy of the developed model. Comparisons of the measured and the ANN predicted atmospheric temperature across selected stations in the climatic zones of Nigeria, showed that the developed model can effectively predict mean monthly atmospheric temperature, using month and climatic zone as input parameters.",TOPIC
10.1145/3512290.3528728,A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with new reproduction and decomposition mechanisms for the multi-point dynamic aggregation problem,"An emerging optimisation problem from real-world applications, named the multi-point dynamic aggregation (MPDA) problem, has become an active research of the multi-robot system. This paper focuses on a multi-objective MPDA (MO-MPDA) problem which is to design execution plans of robots for minimising the cost of used robots and maximising the efficiency of task execution. The MOMPDA problem has the issues of conflicting objectives, redundant representation, and variable-length encoding, posing extra challenges to address the MO-MPDA problem effectively. Combining the ∊-constraint method and decomposition mechanisms, a novel multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm selects the efficiency objective as the main objective and converts the cost objective as constraints. Thus, the multi-objective problem is decomposed into a series of scalar constrained optimisation subproblems by assigning each subproblem with an upper bound constraint. All the subproblems are optimised and evolved simultaneously with the transferring knowledge from other sub-problems to solve the MO-MPDA problem parallelly and efficiently. Besides, considering the characteristics of parent individuals, this paper designs a hybrid reproduction mechanism to transmit effective information to offspring individuals for tackling the encoding redundancy and varying-length. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of most-used metrics.",TOPIC

In this paper, we explore the collaborative self-management work of 28 individuals managing depression who live in the United States. Data collection included remote semi-structured interviews with an associated cognitive mapping exercise. Our findings describe who participants turn to for day-to-day collaborative support, how collaborative activities are enacted (across both mood-focused and preventative support practices), and where these often technology-mediated interactions occur across text, phone, video, and picture-based channels. We discuss collaborative self-management in the depression support context, including key characteristics: agency, reciprocity, time, and interaction. We also present a four-step model of how the process occurs over time (awareness, planning, interaction, and reflection).

Such systems are characterized by close interactions, or even collaborations, between hardware and machinery on the one hand, and humans on the other. Furthermore, as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in general and robotic applications in particular typically operate in an emergent environment, unanticipated events may occur during their operation, making the need for runtime monitoring support a crucial yet often time-consuming task. Runtime monitoring typically requires establishing support for collecting data, aggregating and transporting the data to a monitoring framework for persistence and further processing, and finally, performing checks of functional and non-functional properties. In this paper, we present our initial efforts towards a flexible monitoring framework for ROS-based systems. We report on challenges for establishing runtime monitoring support and present our preliminary architecture that aims to significantly reduce the setup and maintenance effort when creating monitors and establishing constraint checks.",TOPIC

Due to the complexity of the task, robotic manipulation relies on sensors and computationally demanding models, which end up in multiple different software components interacting with each other. Research in deformable object manipulation usually focuses on modeling, planning or control, without focusing on a software architecture. This paper presents a novel software architecture for deformable linear object manipulation. The software architecture includes components for deformable linear object manipulation, namely perception-, observation-, robot control-, planning-, communication- and decision component. On top of these components, a layered software architecture consisting of a decision layer, a skill layer and a functional layer is presented The proposed concept aims to be a blueprint for a unified software architecture satisfying the requirements of robotic systems to achieve deformable linear object manipulation. The validation of the software architecture is done in a case study of an autonomous shape manipulation task, where one robot and a stereo camera shape a deformable linear object to a predefined desired shape.

Also, if the task involves handling capacity, robots must have similar skills. Three concepts were explored to control the cognitive and emotional robot’s behavior: the psychological flow theory, the scaffolding pedagogic strategy, and the multiagents-software paradigm. Based on these concepts, the Human-Robot Scaffolding architecture was designed. It is divided into five blocks. First, the sensory block recognizes body gestures, speech, and task state. Second, the beliefs block estimates the skills and emotional state of learners. Third, the desires block validates the goals the robot can reach; the goals are grouped in skills development, emotional control, cognitive control, challenge control, life signals, and immediate support. Fourth, the intentions block, based on the goals competition strategy, selects the goal that the robot will perform. Finally, the action-planner block regulates the robot’s movements according to the robot’s emotions.

However, producing a seamless fusion requires a greater understanding of the human’s cognitive state as it reacts to uncertainties in both the task environment and agent dynamics. This study examines external behaviors in concert with neurophysiological measures acquired via electroencephalography (EEG) to probe the interactions between cognitive processes, behaviors, and performance in a human-multiagent team task. We show that changes in the α (8–12 Hz) and θ (4–8 Hz) bands of EEG indicate a higher burden on the cognitive resources associated with visual-spatial reasoning required to estimate a more complex kinematic state of robotic agents. These results are reinforced by complementary behavioral shifts in gaze and pilot inputs.

Finally, we show that features based on EEG dynamic-network-metrics provide discriminative information that distinguishes gaze behaviors associated with the attention process.",TOPIC
10.1145/3536167,Personal Space in Human-Robot Interaction at Work: Effect of Room Size and Working Memory Load,"A recent literature review on personal space in human-robot interaction identified a research gap for the influence of contextual factors. At the same time, psychological research on interpersonal distancing and theoretical considerations based on compensatory control models suggest the importance of considering these factors in robot path planning. To address this gap, we tested the effect of room size and working memory load on participants’ comfort distance toward an approaching robot. In a preregistered 3 \texttimes{} 2 within-subject design, N = 72 participants were approached by a mobile manufacturing robot in a corridor with varying room size and with and without a cognitive secondary task. As dependent variables, comfort distance, arousal, and perceived control were measured. While room size and working memory load had no significant direct effect on comfort distance, participants felt higher arousal and lower control in smaller rooms and in conditions with high working memory load, which in turn caused larger comfort distances (indirect effect). With experience, comfort distances decreased. Based on the indirect effects, future studies should test the effect of more extreme manipulations on comfort distances. Robots should adapt their path planning by keeping larger distances toward human workers in stressful environments to avoid discomfort.",TOPIC
10.1145/3539608,Social Relationship Analysis Using State-of-the-art Embeddings,"Detection of human relationships from their interactions on social media is a challenging problem with a wide range of applications in different areas, like targeted marketing, cyber-crime, fraud, defense, planning, and human resource, to name a few. All previous work in this area has only dealt with the most basic types of relationships. The proposed approach goes beyond the previous work to efficiently handle the hierarchy of social relationships. This article introduces a novel technique named Quantifiable Social Relationship (QSR) analysis for quantifying social relationships to analyze relationships between agents from their textual conversations. QSR uses cross-disciplinary techniques from computational linguistics and cognitive psychology to identify relationships. QSR utilizes sentiment and behavioral styles displayed in the conversations for mapping them onto level II relationship categories. Then, for identifying the level III relationship categories, QSR uses level II relationships, sentiments, interactions, and word embeddings as key features. QSR employs natural language processing techniques for feature engineering and state-of-the-art embeddings generated by word2vec, global vectors (glove), and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (bert). QSR combines the intrinsic conversational features with word embeddings for classifying relationships. QSR achieves an accuracy of up to 89\% for classifying relationship subtypes. The evaluation shows that QSR can accurately identify the hierarchical relationships between agents by extracting intrinsic and extrinsic features from textual conversations between agents.",TOPIC
10.1145/3543507.3583380,Response-act Guided Reinforced Dialogue Generation for Mental Health Counseling,"Virtual Mental Health Assistants (VMHAs) have become a prevalent method for receiving mental health counseling in the digital healthcare space. An assistive counseling conversation commences with natural open-ended topics to familiarize the client with the environment and later converges into more fine-grained domain-specific topics. Unlike other conversational systems, which are categorized as open-domain or task-oriented systems, VMHAs possess a hybrid conversational flow. These counseling bots need to comprehend various aspects of the conversation, such as dialogue-acts, intents, etc., to engage the client in an effective and appropriate conversation. Although the surge in digital health research highlights applications of many general-purpose response generation systems, they are barely suitable in the mental health domain – the prime reason is the lack of understanding in the mental health counseling conversation. Moreover, in general, dialogue-act guided response generators are either limited to a template-based paradigm or lack appropriate semantics in dialogue generation. To this end, we propose READER – a REsponse-Act guided reinforced Dialogue genERation model for the mental health counseling conversations. READER is built on transformer to jointly predict a potential dialogue-act dt + 1 for the next utterance (aka response-act) and to generate an appropriate response (ut + 1). Through the transformer-reinforcement-learning (TRL) with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we guide the response generator to abide by dt + 1 and ensure the semantic richness of the responses via BERTScore in our reward computation. We evaluate READER on HOPE, a benchmark counseling conversation dataset and observe that it outperforms several baselines across several evaluation metrics – METEOR, ROUGE, and BERTScore.",TOPIC

When the hybrid robot is working, It is easier to obtain the ideal end pose of the hybrid robot by describing the pose relationship of the robot end relative to the work object than the robot end relative to the world coordinate system. In order to realize the continuous motion control of the hybrid robot with a specified relative attitude relative to a certain plane in space, a method to realized planar motion based on 2SPU+U+RRR type five-degree-of-freedom hybrid robot position and attitude control is proposed. First, the trajectory of the task is discretized, according to the required posture, and the position and attitude matrix of each position on the trajectory is derived. Then through the inverse solution of the kinematic model, the five-degree-of-freedom hybrid robot is completely decoupled. The pose of the robot end is calculated to realize the plane motion control of the robot with a specified pose in Cartesian space according to the kinematic model of the hybrid robot based on the mechanism equivalent principle. Finally, the pose control method of the robot is tested. The experimental results show that the control method can realize the accurate planar motion control of the specified pose in Cartesian space during the repeated planar motion of the 2SPU+U+RRR type 5-DOF hybrid robot. This paper provides a five-degree-of-freedom hybrid robot theoretical model for the position and attitude synchronous motion control of arbitrary plane in Cartesian space.",TOPIC

A recent work investigated, using reactive synthesis, approaches to automate robot task planning, and execution. In this paper, we present a tool that realizes a model-at-runtime approach. The tool is integrated with a robot simulation tool, to automate efficient multi-robot choreography planning, and execution. We illustrate the tool using a multi-robot spot welding cell, inspired from an industrial case. Given a virtual model of the production cell, and user constraints definition, the tool can derive a specification for the reactive synthesis. The tool integrates the synthesized controller with the production cell execution, and in real time, optimizes the strategies by considering the uncertainties. The system can select among several correct, and safe actions, the optimal action using AI-based planning techniques, such as the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. We showcase our tool, illustrate its implementation architecture, including how it can support robot experts for automated planning and execution of production cells.",TOPIC
10.1145/3551708.3556203,MIXED REALITY MEDIA TECHNOLOGIES AS A CATALYST FOR ARCHITECTURAL AGENCY,"Though incredible strides have been made in the adoption of mixed reality technologies in the past decade, the reality is that they have often remained inaccessible for a variety of reasons including expense and expertise. While both the costs and learning curves of these technologies have flattened in recent years, they remain an esoteric component in contemporary pedagogy. This is fundamentally due to the lack of curricular and extracurricular application. This presentation demonstrates the effective adoption of virtual and augmented reality technologies in Canada's largest undergraduate accredited architecture program that has given agency to students in their academic design work and more noteworthy, their extracurricular initiatives. Through a comprehensive case study of a student project showcased at the recent international Winter Stations design exhibition, this paper demonstrates the effective inculcation, integration, and application of mixed reality tools in empowering students to bring their design ideas to built reality. The integration of innovative mixed reality technologies is no longer hampered by technological accessibility; it is mired by curricular inertia and dogma. The promise of breaking through conventional pedagogical frameworks with innovative technologies is reinforced and highlighted in this experiential learning precedent.",TOPIC
10.1145/3551902.3551962,Service Mesh Patterns,"As the benefits and applicability of microservice architectures become better understood by the software industry, and this architecture becomes increasingly more adopted for building stable, independent and scalable cloud applications, a new set of concerns have alerted developers regarding communication between the different microservices. A service mesh tries to address this issue by creating a clear separation of concerns between application logic and the infrastructure needed for the communication between the different services. This is accomplished by abstracting the cross-cutting concerns related with communication out of the internal services making it possible to be reused by the different services. Existing literature describes a service mesh pattern and a sidecar pattern. This paper leans on these patterns and proposes six patterns found by observing the, what is commonly called, good practices. The six patterns are service mesh, shared communication library, node agent, sidecar, service mesh team and control plane per cluster.",TOPIC
10.1145/3564121.3564125,A Hybrid Planning System for Smart Charging of Electric Fleets,"Electric vehicle (EV) fleets are well suited for last-mile deliveries both from sustainability and operational cost perspectives. To ensure economic parity with non-EV options, even captive chargers for EV fleets need to be managed intelligently. Specifically, the EVs needs to be adequately charged for their entire delivery runs while handling reduced time flexibility between runs; limited number of chargers; and deviations from the planned schedule. Existing works either solve smaller instances of this problem optimally, or larger instances with significant sub-optimality. In addition, they typically consider either day-ahead or real-time planning in isolation. We complement existing works with a hybrid approach that first identifies a day-ahead plan for assigning EVs to chargers; and then uses online replanning to handle any deviations in real-time. For the day-ahead planning, we use a learning agent (LA) that learns to assign EVs to chargers over several problem instances. Because the agent solves a given instance during its testing phase, it achieves scale in problem size with limited sub-optimality. For the online replanning, we use a greedy heuristic that dynamically refines the day-ahead plan to handle delays in EV arrivals. We evaluate our approach using representative datasets. As baselines for the LA, we use an exact mixed-integer linear program (MILP) (greedy heuristic) for small (large) problem instances. As baselines for the replanning, we use no-planning and no-replanning. Our experiments show that LA performs better (8.5-14\%) than greedy heuristic in large problem instances, while being reasonably close (&lt; 22\%) to the optimal in smaller instances. For online replanning, our approach performs about 7-20\% better than no-planning and no-replanning for a range of delay profiles.",TOPIC
10.1145/3564121.3564817,Tutorial: Neuro-symbolic AI for Mental Healthcare,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for mental healthcare (MHCare) have been ever-growing after realizing the importance of early interventions for patients with chronic mental health (MH) conditions. Social media (SocMedia) emerged as the go-to platform for supporting patients seeking MHCare. The creation of peer-support groups without social stigma has resulted in patients transitioning from clinical settings to SocMedia supported interactions for quick help. Researchers started exploring SocMedia content in search of cues that showcase correlation or causation between different MH conditions to design better interventional strategies. User-level Classification-based AI systems were designed to leverage diverse SocMedia data from various MH conditions, to predict MH conditions. Subsequently, researchers created classification schemes to measure the severity of each MH condition. Such ad-hoc schemes, engineered features, and models not only require a large amount of data but fail to allow clinically acceptable and explainable reasoning over the outcomes. To improve Neural-AI for MHCare, infusion of clinical symbolic knowledge that clinicans use in decision making is required. An impactful use case of Neural-AI systems in MH is conversational systems. These systems require coordination between classification and generation to facilitate humanistic conversation in conversational agents (CA). Current CAs with deep language models lack factual correctness, medical relevance, and safety in their generations, which intertwine with unexplainable statistical classification techniques. This lecture-style tutorial will demonstrate our investigations into Neuro-symbolic methods of infusing clinical knowledge to improve the outcomes of Neural-AI systems to improve interventions for MHCare:(a) We will discuss the use of diverse clinical knowledge in creating specialized datasets to train Neural-AI systems effectively. (b) Patients with cardiovascular disease express MH symptoms differently based on gender differences. We will show that knowledge-infused Neural-AI systems can identify gender-specific MH symptoms in such patients. (c) We will describe strategies for infusing clinical process knowledge as heuristics and constraints to improve language models in generating relevant questions and responses.",TOPIC

Programmability in the data plane, cloud-native features like automatic scaling and failover, transparent acceleration of both network functions and applications and AI-driven optimizations are already present. We only need to integrate these different innovations into a consistent architecture and offer a simple yet powerful solution for the very different applications that would use future mobile networks. The application space is getting more and more heterogeneous, e.g., legacy Internet-based services still using the good old TCP protocol, future media services relying on multipath transport - always utilizing the best available connection, or control applications of robots or drones requiring extreme low and stable latency. The different applications will require very different Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) from the network. In this paper, we present a novel architecture called DESIRE6G (D6G) architecture that aims to fulfill these requirements by integrating the key technological innovations mentioned above. Besides supporting the diverse KPIs of future applications, the novel architecture should also simplify the mobile network itself by promoting modularity and service-based network function selection which can replace traditional control plane centric solutions, e.g., for handover.",TOPIC

However, in the real world, autonomous robots still require human supervision for safety reasons. We tackle the real-world problem of optimizing autonomous robot timings to maximize deliveries, while ensuring that there are never too many robots running simultaneously so that they can be monitored safely. We assess the use of a recent hybrid machine-learning-optimization approach COIL (constrained optimization in learned latent space) and compare it with a baseline genetic algorithm for the purposes of exploring variations of this problem. We also investigate new methods for improving the speed and efficiency of COIL. We show that only COIL can find valid solutions where appropriate numbers of robots run simultaneously for all problem variations tested. We also show that when COIL has learned its latent representation, it can optimize 10\% faster than the GA, making it a good choice for daily re-optimization of robots where delivery requests for each day are allocated to robots while maintaining safe numbers of robots running at once.",TOPIC
10.1145/3583133.3596302,Quantum Enhancements for AlphaZero,"Reinforcement learning algorithms including AlphaZero are powerful artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, but are known to be resource intensive and unable to train within a reasonable budget. Speeding up learning would be valuable to further expand application areas for real world problems. In this paper, we investigate two quantum computing methods to enhance AlphaZero, with the goal of speeding up training. We evaluate the results by playing the board game Othello, an adversarial multi-agent turn based game similar to the game Go. First, parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) have been shown to train hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning agents in standard benchmark environments. With this inspiration, we replace the classical neural network with a PQC quantum neural network (QNN) in the AlphaZero architecture. Second, tensor-network quantum circuits have been used to extract important features for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks. Using this as inspiration, we use a tree tensor network (TTN) to extract features from the Othello game board, generating a new set of feature vectors for a classical neural network to estimate the policy and value. Results show both novel methods converge to master the game and achieve the same level of play compared to the classical AlphaZero agent.",TOPIC
10.1145/3586996,CNN-based Robust Sound Source Localization with SRP-PHAT for the Extreme Edge,"Robust sound source localization for environments with noise and reverberation are increasingly exploiting deep neural networks fed with various acoustic features. Yet, state-of-the-art research mainly focuses on optimizing algorithmic accuracy, resulting in huge models preventing edge-device deployment. The edge, however, urges for real-time low-footprint acoustic reasoning for applications such as hearing aids and robot interactions. Hence, we set off from a robust CNN-based model using SRP-PHAT features, Cross3D&nbsp;[16], to pursue an efficient yet compact model architecture for the extreme edge. For both the SRP feature representation and neural network, we propose respectively our scalable LC-SRP-Edge and Cross3D-Edge algorithms which are optimized towards lower hardware overhead. LC-SRP-Edge halves the complexity and on-chip memory overhead for the sinc interpolation compared to the original LC-SRP&nbsp;[19]. Over multiple SRP resolution cases, Cross3D-Edge saves 10.32\%~73.71\% computational complexity and 59.77\%~94.66\% neural network weights against the Cross3D baseline. In terms of the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff, the most balanced version (EM) requires only 127.1 MFLOPS computation, 3.71 MByte/s bandwidth, and 0.821 MByte on-chip memory in total, while still retaining competitiveness in state-of-the-art accuracy comparisons. It achieves 8.59&nbsp;ms/frame end-to-end latency on a Rasberry Pi 4B, which is 7.26\texttimes{} faster than the corresponding baseline.",TOPIC
10.1145/3588432.3591510,Acting as Inverse Inverse Planning,"Great storytellers know how to take us on a journey. They direct characters to act—not necessarily in the most rational way—but rather in a way that leads to interesting situations, and ultimately creates an impactful experience for audience members looking on. If audience experience is what matters most, then can we help artists and animators directly craft such experiences, independent of the concrete character actions needed to evoke those experiences? In this paper, we offer a novel computational framework for such tools. Our key idea is to optimize animations with respect to simulated audience members’ experiences. To simulate the audience, we borrow an established principle from cognitive science: that human social intuition can be modeled as “inverse planning,” the task of inferring an agent’s (hidden) goals from its (observed) actions. Building on this model, we treat storytelling as “inverse inverse planning,” the task of choosing actions to manipulate an inverse planner’s inferences. Our framework is grounded in literary theory, naturally capturing many storytelling elements from first principles. We give a series of examples to demonstrate this, with supporting evidence from human subject studies.",TOPIC

However, while these robots need a certain degree of autonomy to learn and explore, they also should respect various constraints, for access control and beyond. We explore incorporating privacy and security constraints (Activity-Centric Access Control and Deep Learning Based Access Control) with robot task planning approaches (classical symbolic planning and end-to-end learning-based planning). We report preliminary results on their respective trade-offs and conclude that a hybrid approach will most likely be the method of choice. © 2023 Owner/Author.",TOPIC
10.1145/3592102,A Temporal Coherent Topology Optimization Approach for Assembly Planning of Bespoke Frame Structures,"We present a computational framework for planning the assembly sequence of bespoke frame structures. Frame structures are one of the most commonly used structural systems in modern architecture, providing resistance to gravitational and external loads. Building frame structures requires traversing through several partially built states. If the assembly sequence is planned poorly, these partial assemblies can exhibit substantial deformation due to self-weight, slowing down or jeopardizing the assembly process. Finding a good assembly sequence that minimizes intermediate deformations is an interesting yet challenging combinatorial problem that is usually solved by heuristic search algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new optimization-based approach that models sequence planning using a series of topology optimization problems. Our key insight is that enforcing temporal coherent constraints in the topology optimization can lead to sub-structures with small deformations while staying consistent with each other to form an assembly sequence. We benchmark our algorithm on a large data set and show improvements in both performance and computational time over greedy search algorithms. In addition, we demonstrate that our algorithm can be extended to handle assembly with static or dynamic supports. We further validate our approach by generating a series of results in multiple scales, including a real-world prototype with a mixed reality assistant using our computed sequence and a simulated example demonstrating a multi-robot assembly application.",TOPIC
10.1145/3598151.3598174,A Collision-free Path Planning Algorithm for Industrial Robots with Adaptive Search Mechanism,"In path planning for industrial robots, collision avoidance is a critical constraint. This paper studies the problem of collision-free motion planning for a spraying robot, i.e., obtaining a series of joint configurations along a given spraying waypoint that satisfies the collision constraints and satisfy the kinematics of the robot. Aiming at this problem, a collision-free motion optimization algorithm based on the adaptive search is proposed in this paper. First, a boundary volume hierarchy (BVH) of the robot and environment is quickly generated based on the GPU parallel architecture. Second, the redundancy of spray incidence angles is used to search for feasible spray incidence angle directions in the redundant space and update the robot's BVHs for collision detection. In addition, during the optimization iterations, the size of the search space is adaptively reduced according to the number of collision failures in the previous iterations to avoid falling into a local optimum. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulation on a six-degrees-of-freedom robot performing a spraying task.",TOPIC
10.1145/3598151.3598191,A Hierarchical Autonomous Exploration Algorithm for Large-scale and Complex Environments with Mobile Robot,"In order to solve the problem of low exploration efficiency caused by repeatedly backtracking the frontiers in large and complex environments, a hierarchical autonomous exploration algorithm is proposed. Firstly, based on the robot's static model to judge the environment's traversability, which allows robots to explore complex 3D environments. Following that, a hybrid strategy is used to filter out frontiers within a local planning horizon, thus complete exploration of the local area is achieved by solving the traveling salesman problem (TSP). Finally, the sparse global topology map generates transfer paths between sub-areas, transferring the robot to another sub-area to resume exploration. Compared to the RRT autonomous exploration algorithm and the GBP autonomous exploration algorithm, the method in this work reduces the exploration path by more than 13.8\% and the exploration time by more than 23.7\%. The results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the autonomous exploration efficiency of mobile robots in large and complex environments.",TOPIC
10.1145/3603269.3604860,EBB: Reliable and Evolvable Express Backbone Network in Meta,"We present the design, implementation, evaluation, deployment and production experiences of EBB (Express BackBone), a private WAN (Wide Area Network) connecting Meta's global data centers (DCs). Initiated in 2015, EBB now carries 100\% of DC-DC traffic, witnessing remarkable growth over the years. A key design aspect of EBB is its multi-plane architecture, facilitating seamless deployment of a new control plane while ensuring operational simplicity. This architecture allows for efficient failure mitigation, standard maintenance, and capacity expansion by draining one or two planes without impacting service level objectives (SLOs). Another critical design decision is the hybrid model, combining distributed control agents and a central controller. EBB's centralized traffic engineering utilizes an MPLS-TE based solution to allocate paths periodically for different traffic classes based on service requirements, while its distributed control agents enable fast local failure recovery by pre-installing pre-computed backup paths in the data plane. We delve into our eight-year production experience, highlighting the successful deployment of multiple generations of EBB.",TOPIC
10.1145/3604571.3604572,Empathy-Driven Innovation: Analysis of Five User-Centered Design Thinking Case Studies,"Design Thinking (DT) is widely used to drive innovation in companies. DT consists of five phases: empathy, define, ideation, prototype, and test. However, companies often skip the empathy process and go directly to the ideation phase. It is because empathy cannot immediately solve problems, is time- and resource-consuming, and is hindered by the cognitive bias that companies believe they already know what users or customers want. This article presents the process of empathy in five cases of Design Thinking (DT) projects in Indonesia carried out by postgraduate students who have worked in the companies for years. The projects discussed are a bank's marketing plan for ultra-micro entrepreneurs, the development of an online community platform by a software development company, the creation of tourist attractions in a forest area by the government tourism agency, the creation of an online ecosystem for the footwear industry by the government, and the development of a digital e-contract by a state-owned enterprise. We conducted a comparative case study analysis to examine the empathy process in meeting user needs and achieving innovation in these projects. This article argues that optimizing the empathic process in DT can lead to innovation. However, this empathic phase should continue through the ideation, prototyping, and testing phases. An individual who works in a company can initiate and carry out this empathy process. Nevertheless, the following phases require the support and involvement of all stakeholders in the company.",TOPIC

However, there is a very limited amount of research which focuses on mapping the flapping fin propulsion to model the complete dynamics of the bioinspired robot. Multiple parameters like amplitude of motion, flapping frequency and initial angle of attack affect the overall motion dynamics. In this work, the propulsive thrust generated from the undulating fin structure is numerically investigated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study. Further, this non-linear thrust map is used to formulate the mathematical model of the proposed biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicle (BAUV). To validate the trajectory tracking performance of the proposed system in 2D planar maneuver, coupled dynamics of the underactuated vehicle (with one caudal, and two dorsal fins) is derived and hybrid control strategy is implemented. Trajectory tracking control of the proposed structure is also studied which is challenging because of the oscillatory motions of the fins. For a L-shaped trajectory of edge length 200m, the proposed BAUV with a span-length of 2.5 m is capable to render the desired trajectory with permissible error of 0.2 m, maximum flapping frequency of 0.6 Hz and dorsal fin deflection of 25 degrees which verify the accuracy of the proposed BAUV model.",TOPIC

Standard industrial robots can be modified to increase their workspace and overall Manipulability by moving their base on a predetermined optimum track, thus, increasing their overall effectivity. Hybrid robot kinematic chains can benefit from both the properties of having a serial and parallel chain, giving maneuverability and dexterity, along with good accuracy and rigidity.

10.1145/3610579.3611082,Explaining Unsolvability of Planning Problems in Hybrid Systems with Model Reconciliation,"A recent problem of interest in Explainable AI Planning is that of explaining the unsolvability of planning problems. Though there has been a lot of research on generating explanations of solutions to planning problems, explaining the absence of solutions remains a largely open and understudied problem. Model reconciliation has been a popular approach for generating explanations for such problems in recent literature, which involves an AI agent and a human planner, who have different models of the planning domain and each explains to the other the differences they have in their domain representations and attempt to arrive at a consensus. More often than not, it is assumed that the AI agent has a correct and complete view of the domain, of which the human only has a partial view. Through reconciliation, the human domain is updated to be consistent with what the AI agent has. Most of the works in this direction are targeted toward classical planning problems on domains represented typically as discrete state transition systems or variants. In this paper, we provide an approach towards model reconciliation for planning problems in hybrid systems represented as a mix of discrete and continuous domains. We assume that the agent has a complete model of the environment, while the human has a partial or erroneous model and expects a plan for the planning problem when there is none. The explanation problem is presented as a process of continuous reconciliation between these two entities (agent and human) to make the human domain consistent with that of the agent. To this effect, we use a mix of graph traversal and path analysis, along with Linear programming to carry out the reconciliation process. In particular, we use the concept of Irreducible Infeasible Sets (IIS) to generate explanations. Experimental results on 2 representative hybrid domains show the efficacy of our approach.",TOPIC

To assist individuals facing difficulty in visual or auditory perception, this paper designs \&amp; develops a multimodal AI agent using recent advances in the field. We aim to solve the challenge of enabling persons with Visual or Auditory Processing Disorders to learn \&amp; communicate. We do this by exploring a design that allows the transformation of information across visual and language modalities. This design can be realized with the recent advances in Generative Multimodal AI. Based on each individual's needs, the AI agent dynamically adapts the Human Computer interaction model. For instance, for a child with Visual Processing Disorder (VPD), given the child's hindered ability to make sense of information taken in through the eyes, the Multimodal AI agent transforms any visual information into auditory user interaction. In another instance, for a person with Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), given the hindrance in the individual's ability to analyze information taken in through the ears, the AI dynamically translates any speech modality into visual cues. Thus the AI agent adapts dynamically to the strengths and abilities of the individual. To enable students with VPD to learn, the design allows the student to ask questions about an image. This design is realized as a Visual Question Answering task in Vision Language Transformer models. We explore interactive multimodal conversations with Few shot Learning and In-Context Instruction Tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models to address difficulty in visual reasoning. To enable persons with CAPD to learn, the design translates audio lectures into visual cues. This visual cue consists of a combination of words using speech recognition and Large Language Models based re-phrasing to simpler words, cross-modal retrieval of images to address auditory memory challenges, and AI-generated images. To identify the strengths of each child, we also explore Multimodal embedding based Multimodal latent space arithmetic to link AI across senses. To effectively integrate the proposed design into the mainstream, we explore a universal design based inclusive approach to extend the use case to create AI assistants for assisting children with different learning styles such as visual learners or auditory learners. To enable future research on the proposed design, we explore an architecture to compose a pipeline of AI models, and to connect with external systems via plugin connectors. We implement lab scale prototypes of this design and present a demo on the project webpage at https://sites.google.com/view/multimodallearningdisability.",TOPIC

As we hypothesise that these demands could be coped by optimising the environmental resources of the architectural layout, we deployed a mobile robotic partition that autonomously manoeuvres between predetermined locations. During a five-weeks in-the-wild study within a real-world open-plan office, we studied how 13 workers adopted four distinct adaptation strategies when sharing the spatiotemporal control of the robotic partition. Based on their logged and self-reported reasoning, we present six initiation regulating factors that determine the appropriateness of each adaptation strategy. This study thus contributes to how future human-building interaction could autonomously improve the experience, comfort, performance, and even the health and wellbeing of multiple workers that share the same workplace.",TOPIC

However, there is also a need to empirically explore the mechanisms involved in creating this value. Against this backdrop, this paper aims to answer the research question: “Which mechanisms contribute to generating value through using Enterprise Architecture in government?” The research was conducted through a survey administered to Swedish government organizations, directed by a public value framework. The data analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics and an inductive analysis of open-text answers. The findings reveal values associated with the use of EA in government and corresponding value-generating mechanisms. Core activities in the municipalities consist of establishing digital value chains where values are generated for citizens and the internal administration. National agencies engage more in creating strategic value through intrinsic enhancements enabled via EA to establish organizational commonalities. Our findings informed a conceptual framework, which encompasses organizing principles, core EA activities, and applications. This research contributes to the literature on the use of EA in government by highlighting EA activities related to the strategic orientation of organizational operations and enablers for deriving valuable results from these activities. Our framework, informed by theories of public value and results from practice, provides a roadmap for public managers to plan and operationalize their architectural work. By doing so, we contribute to establishing an important link between research on EA in the public sector and public value theory. We conclude the paper with suggesting additional research on two identified research gaps: 1. Using EA for participatory processes, 2. Further investigation of evaluation practices.",TOPIC
10.1145/3623263.3623359,Reinforcement learning for scaffold-free construction of spanning structures,"In construction robotics, a conventional design-to-fabrication workflow starts with designing a structure, followed by task and robotic motion planning, and ultimately, fabrication. However, this approach can prove unsuccessful, as we may only discover the infeasibility of a design at the final stages of the process. This can result in rework and a considerable waste of time and resources. To overcome this challenge, we propose a design method based on reinforcement learning (RL) where the agent makes decisions at every step of the sequential assembly of the structure while considering assembly’s stability. In this way, we take the construction constraints into consideration at the design stage. The research particularly focuses on the design of spanning structures that multiple robot arms can construct without the need for scaffolding. A series of experiments were conducted using both a centralized and a decentralized learning setup. Our results show that while the decentralized setup was successful in constructing smaller structures, only the centralized setup allowed active collaboration between robot arms, resulting in structures with larger spans. To validate our approach, we fabricated two of the designed structures with two collaborating robot arms, which confirmed the feasibility of these designs. In summary, the proposed method opens exciting possibilities for generating innovative designs that push the boundaries of architectural creativity while simultaneously fulfilling fabrication-related constraints.",TOPIC

10.1145/3627611.3627616,Engaging Cities: From Urban Space to Media Interface,"Technology in this millennium has evolved to become a conduit for communication, creative expression and knowledge transmission. Central to this is the designer's agentic role in mediating the percolation of the digital into the built environment to produce new and transformative experiences incorporating mixed reality. Through discussing two speculative projects, this paper poses the question of what instigative role media might play in efforts to boost spatial ambience and social agency. The first reimagines an AR media architecture experience: by expanding the scope of screen media to include touch media and mobile media, handheld devices fulfil a fresh function, to re-center the urban experience alongside encouraging multidimensional user interaction. Meanwhile, a virtually mediated tour conceived to explore interactions between media and architecture, user agency and behavior, redefines an appreciation for the mimetic. While VR is unable to replicate the randomness and complexity of real-world experience, the sensorial richness of the lived environment and in-person interactions, insights can still be gleaned by how people navigate in cities, even in a simulated environment. These examples reconfirm how our relationship with urban space has been irrevocably altered by digital affordance, through interpretation, interactions and interventions. They open up a dialogue on other alternatives to traditional notions and practices of media architecture. Given the proliferation of digital and online tools and platforms, it stands to reason that now is the opportune time to enskill and empower designers to seize control of the technological ensemble, and exploit what the digital affords, to interpret new and meaningful uses.",TOPIC
10.1145/3638209.3638213,Innovative Urban Design Simulation: Utilizing Agent-Based Modelling through Reinforcement Learning,"Data-driven design for cities is improving the quality of everyday life of citizens and optimizes the usage of resources. A new aspect is artificial intelligence, which Smart Cities could greatly benefit from. A central problem for urban designers is the unavailability of data to make relevant decisions. Agent-based simulations enable a view of the dynamic properties of the urban system, generating data in its course. However, the simulation must remain sufficiently simple to remain in the realm of computability. The research question of this paper is: How can we make agents behave more realistically to analyze citizens’ mobility behavior? To solve this problem, we first created a simulated virtual environment, where agents can move freely in a small part of a city, the harbor area in Hamburg, Germany. We assumed that happiness is a crucial motivating factor for the movement of citizens. A survey of 130 citizens provided the weights that govern the simulated environment and the happiness score assignation of places. As an AI method, we then used Reinforcement Learning as a general model and Q-learning as an algorithm to generate a baseline. Through randomly traversing the model environment a baseline was created. We are in the process of enhancing Reinforcement Learning with a Deep Q-Network to make the actors learn. Early experiments show a significant improvement over a tabular Q-learning approach. This paper contributes to the literature of urban planning, and data-driven architectural design. The main contribution is replacing the inefficient search for a global maximum of the happiness function, with an efficient local solution global maximum. This has implications for further research in the generation of synthetic data through simulations.",TOPIC

However, the challenges of learning a single controller to control multiple morphologies make the 'one robot one task' paradigm dominant in the field. To alleviate these challenges, we present a pipeline that: (1) leverages Quality Diversity algorithms like MAP-Elites to create a dataset of many single-task/single-morphology teacher controllers, then (2) distills those diverse controllers into a single multi-morphology controller that performs well across many different body plans by mimicking the sensory-action patterns of the teacher controllers via supervised learning. The distilled controller scales well with the number of teachers/morphologies and shows emergent properties. It generalizes to unseen morphologies in a zero-shot manner, providing robustness to morphological perturbations and instant damage recovery. Lastly, the distilled controller is also independent of the teacher controllers - we can distill the teacher's knowledge into any controller model, making our approach synergistic with architectural improvements and existing training algorithms for teacher controllers.",TOPIC
10.1145/3638530.3654431,Quality Diversity for Robot Learning: Limitations and Future Directions,"Quality Diversity (QD) has shown great success in discovering high-performing, diverse policies for robot skill learning. While current benchmarks have led to the development of powerful QD methods, we argue that new paradigms must be developed to facilitate open-ended search and generalizability. In particular, many methods focus on learning diverse agents that each move to a different xy position in MAP-Elites-style bounded archives. Here, we show that such tasks can be accomplished with a single, goal-conditioned policy paired with a classical planner, achieving O(1) space complexity w.r.t. the number of policies and generalization to task variants. We hypothesize that this approach is successful because it extracts task-invariant structural knowledge by modeling a relational graph between adjacent cells in the archive. We motivate this view with emerging evidence from computational neuroscience and explore connections between QD and models of cognitive maps in human and other animal brains. We conclude with a discussion exploring the relationships between QD and cognitive maps, and propose future research directions inspired by cognitive maps towards future generalizable algorithms capable of truly open-ended search. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",TOPIC
10.1145/3638530.3664116,Improving Efficiency of Evolving Robot Designs via Self-Adaptive Learning Cycles and an Asynchronous Architecture,"Algorithmic frameworks for the joint optimisation of a robot's design and controller often utilise a learning loop nested within an evolutionary algorithm to refine the controller associated with a newly generated robot design. Intuitively, it is reasonable to assume that the length of the learning period required is directly related to the complexity of the new design. Therefore, we propose a novel self-adaptive criterion that modifies the learning budget for each individual robot based on setting a target for the progress to be achieved during learning. This stopping criterion can lead to wide variance in learning times per robot evaluated. Research in other domains where variable evaluation time is also observed has suggested that asynchronous architectures are preferable in this situation, leading to improved objective performance and efficiency. We conduct a systematic comparison of synchronous and asynchronous architectures using the new learning stopping criterion in a joint optimisation task, showing that a judicious choice of target learning progress used in conjunction with an asynchronous framework provides considerably better results in terms of fitness and computational efficiency than a synchronous framework --- in the latter, the choice of target learning progress has no significant influence.",TOPIC

Among the many branches of intelligent robots, the path planning problem is a particularly important one, and with the development of science and technology and the wide application of intelligent robots, the design of robot trajectory optimization is facing new challenges. The native ant colony algorithm is easy to fall into the local optimal solution in dealing with the problem of robot path planning. Through algorithm analysis, a hybrid ant colony algorithm is proposed. When integrating genetic algorithm and incorporating crossover and mutation factors into the hybrid ant colony algorithm, it not only enhances the diversity of the population, but also speeds up the convergence speed of the algorithm and improves the quality of the optimal solution. The case study shows that the combination of ant colony algorithm and genetic algorithm effectively avoids the problems of instability and poor robustness of the traditional ant colony algorithm, and a more efficient and stable path planning solution can be obtained, which further improves the working effect of the intelligent robot.",TOPIC

Existing diffusion-based methods employ disparate network architectures and training strategies. The effect of the design of each component is still unclear. In addition, the iterative denoising process consumes considerable computational overhead, which is prohibitive for real-time scenarios such as virtual characters and humanoid robots. For this reason, we first conduct a comprehensive investigation into network architectures, training strategies, and inference process. Based on the profound analysis, we tailor each component for efficient high-quality human motion generation. Despite the promising performance, the tailored model still suffers from foot skating which is an ubiquitous issue in diffusion-based solutions. To eliminate footskate, we identify foot-ground contact and correct foot motions along the denoising process. By organically combining these well-designed components together, we present StableMoFusion, a robust and efficient framework for human motion generation. Extensive experimental results show that our StableMoFusion performs favorably against current state-of-the-art methods.",TOPIC

To enable real-time interpersonal communications between users across the globe, the metaverse places high demands on network performance, including low latency, high bandwidth, and fast network speeds. This paper proposes a novel Media Convergence Metaverse Network (MCMN) framework to address these challenges. Specifically, the META controller serves as MCMN's logically centralized control plane, responsible for holistic orchestration across edge sites and end-to-end path computation between metaverse users. We develop a model-free deep reinforcement learning-based metaverse traffic optimization algorithm that learns to route flows while satisfying the Quality of Service (QoS) boundaries. The network slicing engine leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to create isolated, customized virtual networks tailored for metaverse traffic dynamics on demand. It employs unsupervised and reinforcement learning techniques using network telemetry from the META controller to understand application traffic patterns and train cognitive slicer agents to make quality of service -aware decisions accordingly. Optimized delivery of diverse concurrent media types necessitates routing intelligence to meet distinct requirements while mitigating clashes over a shared infrastructure. Media-aware routing enhances traditional shortest-path approaches by combining topological metrics with workflow sensitivities. We realize an edge-assisted rendering fabric to offload complex processing from bandwidth-constrained endpoints while retaining visual realism. Extensive simulations demonstrate MCMN's superior performance compared to conventional networking paradigms.

However, the systems of the governments are very different and even within a country there are distinctions between the federal, state, local and agency levels according to their specific context and capabilities. Among the governmental systems, electronic procurement is critical as they are related to a significant part of public spending. The purpose of this paper is to describe an assessment of the current state of digitization of procurement processes of innovative governments to deduce components of a common architecture from their best practices experiences that can be utilized for benchmark evaluation. This study employed an Action Design Research approach to identify, stakeholders, processes, system applications, technological components, and standards of a generic architecture for e-procurement. As a result, it was possible to deduce from countries implemented cases and validate through an organization benchmarking action case a generic architecture with four main system components: (1) e-planning of government procurement, (2) e-selection of suppliers, and (3) e-provisioning of goods and services from suppliers (4) e-services to citizens. The most developed component in government cases is e-selection, however, further developments should be carried out in e-planning and e-provisioning, mainly the integration with e-services. This work demonstrates how management research can create references for digital transformation. As a practical implication, the architectural model provides professionals with a tool for benchmark assessments, for decision-make on the evolution of functionalities and system requirements for government e-procurement.",TOPIC

Utilizing historical meteorological data, we forecast the flow volumes for the following 30 hours based on the data from the first 15 hours. Our approach involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and performance evaluation. Results indicate promising accuracy in flow prediction across multiple sites. Accurate streamflow forecasting is essential for effective water resource management and flood resilience planning. Traditional numerical models often face limitations in computational efficiency and inability to fully capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics of hydrological systems. With the recent advancements in deep learning, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, there is an opportunity to enhance streamflow predictions. This paper explores the application of LSTM networks for hourly streamflow forecasting at multiple catchments in the United States. Leveraging extensive, near-real-time hydrological and meteorological data from agencies such as the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the study develops an LSTM-based model to predict water flow. The model integrates historical data on temperature, precipitation, and flow measurements, and is trained to forecast streamflow at hourly intervals. Results demonstrate that the LSTM model effectively captures temporal dependencies, outperforming traditional methods. This study highlights the potential of LSTM networks to provide accurate and computationally efficient streamflow predictions, contributing to improved water management and flood forecasting capabilities. Future research directions include the incorporation of additional features and the exploration of advanced neural network architectures to further enhance prediction performance.",TOPIC

Importantly, our CGSs are such that it is still decidable to model-check these CGSs against a relevant fragment of ATL. These systems can be thought as a generalization of architectures allowing information forks, that is, cases where strategic abilities lead to certain agents outside a coalition privately sharing information with selected agents inside that coalition. Moreover, in our case, in the initial states of the system, we allow information forks from agents outside a given set  (A)  to agents inside this group (A) . For this reason, together with the fact that the communication in our models underpins a specialized form of broadcast, we call our formalism  (A)  -cast systems. To underline, the fragment of ATL for which we show the model-checking problem to be decidable over  (A) -cast is a large and significant one; it expresses coalitions over agents in any subset of the set  (A) . Indeed, as we show, our systems and this ATL fragments can encode security problems that are notoriously hard to express faithfully: terrorist-fraud attacks in identity schemes.",TOPIC

The primary challenge addressed is the efficient training of an RL agent to navigate mazes ranging from simple 17x17 grids to complex 263x263 grids. Our approach integrates curriculum learning to increase the complexity of mazes during training gradually and employs hybrid exploration strategies to balance exploration and exploitation effectively. Although the experiments were conducted in a simulated environment, the methods developed hold significant promise for real-world microrobot applications. We benchmarked our RL framework, which is built on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), against traditional pathfinding algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), A-star, and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT).

However, many adversary emulation methods often rely on automated planning and underplay the role of human cognition. Consequently, defenders are often underprepared for human attackers who can think creatively and adapt their strategies. In this article, we propose the design of adversarial cognitive agents that are dynamic, adaptable, and able to learn from experience. These cognitive agents are built based on the theoretical principles of Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT) of experiential choice in dynamic tasks, making them more challenging than strategically optimal adversaries for human defenders. Our research offers three main contributions. First, in a simulation experiment, we demonstrate how IBL attacker agents can learn from experience and become as efficient as optimal strategic algorithms against a strategic defender. In a second simulation experiment, the IBL attackers are pitted against an IBL defender, showing that the IBL attacker can be a more challenging adversary for the IBL defender, while the IBL defender can learn to counter carefully crafted optimal attack strategies. To test these observations, we conducted a third experiment, where humans played the role of defenders against both strategic and IBL attackers in an interactive task. The results confirm the predictions of the second simulation experiment: Cognitive attackers are more challenging for human defenders than strategic attackers. These insights contribute to informing future adversary emulation efforts and training of cyber defenders.",TOPIC

10.1145/3716553.3750771,A Multifaceted Multi-Agent Framework for Zero-Shot Emotion Analysis and Recognition of Symbolic Music,"This paper presents the first attempt at zero-shot music emotion recognition (MER) to map musical pieces, represented in symbolic formats (e.g., ABC notation), onto the valence-arousal space. Conventional MER approaches typically train an end-to-end deep neural network (DNN). However, the performance of such supervised methods is limited due to the multifaceted and ambiguous nature of music emotions, compounded by the scarcity of MER datasets. To address this, we leverage knowledge transfer from large language models (LLMs) pre-trained on vast text and symbolic data. We hypothesize that LLMs possess capabilities in low-level music description and high-level emotion reasoning (not necessarily in a musical context). Accordingly, we propose a multi-agent framework that performs zero-shot MER by associating objective musical attributes (harmony, melody, rhythm, and structure) with subjective attributes (valence and arousal). Our system employs a hierarchical architecture comprising (i) musical element descriptors, (ii) chain-of-thought emotion analysts, and (iii) comprehensive predictors. Knowledge injection and zero-shot prompting are utilized to mitigate inherent model biases. Evaluations on the EMOPIA dataset demonstrate that our system, built on the Gemini-2.0-Flash backbone, significantly outperforms baseline LLM models, including ultra-large models and mixture-of-experts (MoE) systems, and performs comparably to fully supervised or fine-tuned models.",TOPIC

Electric vehicles (EVs) offer unique potential in enhancing this stability through intelligent (dis-)charging control; by aggregation, they can provide significant balancing services to network operators. To exploit this opportunity, airport parking is particularly well suited due to the large number of vehicles with predictable departure times. By using the novel Automated Valet Charging (AVC) technology, parking facilities can optimally schedule EVs---autonomously maneuvering cars to and from charge points and connecting them robotically. We propose using AVC-capable parking facilities as virtual power plants (VPPs), providing fast-acting frequency containment reserve (FCR). This study's key contributions are: 1) presenting the AVC VPP concept and formalizing its two core optimization tasks, 2) developing a modular co-simulation architecture for comprehensive evaluation, 3) performing preliminary experiments, to assess feasibility and to identify simulation challenges, and 4) outlining strategic recommendations for practical AVC VPP implementation. The results suggest the concept's potential in utilizing airport EV parking for FCR, promising additional revenue for parking operators without sacrificing customer satisfaction. However, for conclusive assessment, extended simulation models are necessary. Furthermore, prequalification emerges as a significant obstacle to profitable real-world applications. Ultimately, AVC VPPs may help with transforming EVs from being a burden on the grid to a valuable asset.",TOPIC
10.1145/3728725.3728759,A Guided-learning Network for Brain Tumor Segmentation with Missing Modalities,"Accurate segmentation of brain tumors is essential for clinical assessment and treatment planning, as it leverages multiple MRI modalities to provide complementary diagnostic information. However, missing modalities are frequently en- countered in clinical practice due to factors such as image degradation, artifacts, protocol inconsistencies, or patient con- traindications to contrast agents. While certain unified models are designed to accommodate various missing modality scenarios, their performance declines markedly when multiple modalities are absent, particularly in cases where only a single modality is available. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a Guided- learning Network that leverages dynamic FFT filters. This network trains multiple specialized models designed for different missing modality scenarios, achieving outstanding performance. The architecture comprises two distinct learning paths: one dedicated to capturing multimodal information and another focused on generating modality-specific representations for the missing modality. A guided-learning strategy connects these two paths. Initially, the multimodal path is trained and its parameters are locked, enabling the missing modality path to learn under its guidance. The training process incorporates several key com- ponents: adversarial learning to align high-level features across paths, frequency-domain adaptive filtering using dynamic FFT filters to extract global features, and mutual information transfer to ensure critical information is retained even when modality data is missing. Experiments conducted on the BraTS2018 dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms comparable state-of- the-art methods in all missing modality cases.",TOPIC
10.1145/3730824,Learning to Assemble with Alternative Plans,"We present a reinforcement learning framework for constructing assemblies composed of rigid parts, which are commonly seen in many historical masonry buildings and bridges. Traditional construction methods for such structures often depend on dense scaffolding to stabilize their intermediate assembly steps, making the process both labor-intensive and time-consuming. This work utilizes multiple robots to collaboratively assemble structures, offering temporary support by holding parts in place without additional scaffolding. Precomputing the robotic assembly process to ensure structural stability involves a time-consuming offline process due to the combinatorial nature of its search space. However, the precomputed assembly plans may get disrupted during real-world execution due to unforeseen changes, such as setup modifications or delays in part delivery. Recomputing these plans using traditional offline methods results in significant project delays. Therefore, we propose a reinforcement learning-based approach in which a neural network is trained to efficiently generate alternative assembly plans for a given structure online, enabling adaptation to external changes. To enable effective and efficient training, we introduce three key innovations: a GPU-based stability simulator for parallelizing simulations, a novel curriculum-based training scheme to address sparse rewards during training, and a new graph neural network architecture for efficiently encoding assembly geometry. We validate our approach by training reinforcement learning agents on various assemblies and evaluating their performance on unseen assembly tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in planning multi-robot assembly processes, effectively handling disruptions in both simulation and physical environments.",TOPIC

Assistive robots become an opportunity to favour the ageing in place allowing elderlies to remain in the home environment while increasing safety, healthy lifestyles, and remote monitoring for facilitating early intervention in an emergency. The present pilot work aims to compare two different human-robot interactions based on both usability and user-experience standardized scales and semi-structured interviews administered to a group of 10 elderly people to identify the factors affecting technology acceptance. The use of two different robots based on touch screen (Temi) and oral communication (Ohmni) equipped with specific sensors is investigated in four different scenarios with both clinical and social purposes: cognitive stimulation, nutritional control, physiological parameters monitoring, and entertainment. The study's findings report that the initial distrust in innovative and unusual technologies may be reduced by approaching them in a controlled environment. However, the perception of the usefulness and usability of robots, and more generally of technology, is also influenced by the personal nature of the user and the reason for use. Indeed, robots appear to be a threat to older adults’ independence, especially those who stay fit and behave independently. Concerning the robots’ interaction modes, most users preferred a combined interaction based on both vocal and written communication to make up for hearing or visual problems. Moreover, a robot exhibiting both a static and dynamic mode was preferred. However, further studies should be devoted to the optimization of the adopted technologies considering the users’ feedback for improved adaptivity and technology acceptance.",TOPIC

While robotic rollators have shown potential in providing mobility assistance, existing systems often rely on static navigation approaches that lack a capacity to dynamically adapt to path changes and unforeseen deviations. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a dynamic turn-by-turn navigation system designed to provide real-time, user-centered guidance. The system aims to enhance spatial orientation and wayfinding through online dynamic planning, addressing critical limitations of current solutions. We present results from user trials in a simulated environment, which show its potential to improve mobility. Possible areas of improvement are also discussed, paving the way for more effective assistive technologies in real-world settings.",TOPIC

In cooperative driving scenarios, trust must exceed ego vehicles to include other autonomous vehicles and their coordination. This is challenged by unexpected multi-agent interactions, diminishing human control, and limited system transparency. We hypothesize that enhancing transparency by providing information about ego vehicle, other cooperative vehicles, and road conditions can foster trust. This is achieved by visualizing vehicle-to-everything (V2X) information via augmented reality (AR) interfaces. To test this in a safe environment, we conducted a within-subjects experiment in a Virtual Reality (VR) driving simulator with AR overlays. Participants experienced three interface concepts: (A) no transparency, (B) system-level transparency (ego vehicle intentions only), and (C) environment-level transparency (cooperation intentions, planned paths, and infrastructure). Results show that environment-level transparency, despite the higher cognitive workload, enhanced trust in both ego and cooperating FAVs.",TOPIC

The handling and palletizing control system can assist packaging production lines in achieving rapid handling and palletizing of boxes, facilitating subsequent transportation and processing of boxes. At present, the handling and palletizing control system is mainly aimed at the application of unidirectional palletizing layout in single conveyor production lines. The efficiency of handling and palletizing is low, and its control algorithm is complex, with many repeated trajectories, which makes it difficult to speed up the system operation and has a significant impact on the production and processing output of box bodies. Using robotstudio software, a control system for single conveyor line handling and double-sided multi-layer palletizing based on robot control is designed to meet the needs of real production line box handling and palletizing. By building a structured handling and palletizing control algorithm architecture, simplifying the layout of handling and palletizing workstations, optimizing the handling and palletizing process, the efficiency of robot motion trajectory planning is improved, and problems such as low intelligence level, low production efficiency, and cumbersome robot operation trajectory of handling and palletizing production lines are solved.",TOPIC

Our Snapology system specifically employs rhombic and regular triangular modules, with all creases constrained to a single fold direction (valley or mountain). The key finding lies in exploiting geometric frustration — the inability of the system to satisfy all geometric constraints simultaneously — to achieve rapid transformation from planar to three-dimensional (3D) configurations through snapping motion. The transformation principle is programmable by controlling the activation of out-of-plane fold hinges incident on a single vertex, enabling two distinct motions: smooth motion and snapping motion. We develop kinematic models to analyze configuration spaces and elucidate the underlying transformation principles. Computational modeling and prototype fabrication validate the predicted snapping behaviors. Design explorations demonstrate various system configurations that achieve programmable 2D-to-3D transformations through controlled snapping motion. This work establishes a new paradigm for frustration-driven modular origami design, with applications in programmable matter, soft robotics, and adaptive architectural systems.",TOPIC

We present MindFuse, a brave new explainable generative AI framework designed to act as a strategic partner in the marketing process. Unlike conventional LLM applications that stop at content generation, MindFuse fuses CTR-based content AI-guided co-creation with large language models to extract, interpret, and iterate on communication narratives grounded in real advertising data. MindFuse operates across the full marketing lifecycle: from distilling content pillars and customer personas from competitor campaigns to recommending in-flight optimizations based on live performance telemetry. It uses attention-based explainability to diagnose ad effectiveness and guide content iteration, while aligning messaging with strategic goals through dynamic narrative construction and storytelling. We introduce a new paradigm in GenAI for marketing, where LLMs not only generate content but reason through it, adapt campaigns in real time, and learn from audience engagement patterns. Our results, validated in agency deployments, demonstrate up to 12\texttimes{} efficiency gains, setting the stage for future integration with empirical audience data (e.g., GWI, Nielsen) and full-funnel attribution modeling. MindFuse redefines AI not just as a tool, but as a collaborative agent in the creative and strategic fabric of modern marketing. In the end of the paper, we also provide a forward-looking forecast on how platforms like MindFuse and Google DeepMind's ACAI are likely to shape the future of marketing agencies. These systems will not only reset client expectations toward greater transparency, speed, and personalization, but will also redefine the skillsets demanded from the new generation of marketers. As hybrid agencies emerge-blending creative storytelling with data science and AI engineering-the competitive landscape will increasingly hinge on talent. In this new environment, professionals will be expected to pair human imagination with technical fluency, while agencies will need to reinvent themselves as AI facilitators and curators of brand authenticity amidst the ongoing talent war led by platforms such as Meta.",TOPIC
10.1145/3746059.3747789,Cooperative Design Optimization through Natural Language Interaction,"Designing successful interactions requires identifying optimal design parameters. To do so, designers often conduct iterative user testing and exploratory trial-and-error. This involves balancing multiple objectives in a high-dimensional space, making the process time-consuming and cognitively demanding. System-led optimization methods, such as those based on Bayesian optimization, can determine for designers which parameters to test next. However, they offer limited opportunities for designers to intervene in the optimization process, negatively impacting the designer’s experience. We propose a design optimization framework that enables natural language interactions between designers and the optimization system, facilitating cooperative design optimization. This is achieved by integrating system-led optimization methods with Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing designers to intervene in the optimization process and better understand the system’s reasoning. Experimental results show that our method provides higher user agency than a system-led method and shows promising optimization performance compared to manual design. It also matches the performance of an existing cooperative method with lower cognitive load.",TOPIC

By visualizing the biosignals of both humans and plants in a shared environment, Empathic Growth creates a visualized space of shared perception, encouraging participants to reflect on plant agency and fostering empathy between species. The installation exhibition revealed that participants developed a greater awareness of plant perception and a deeper empathy for plant life, encouraging a rethinking of human-plant relationships. Through three iterative exhibitions, Empathic Growth evolved from an initial experiment exploring emotional symbiosis between humans and plants into a real-time interactive hybrid perception interface, ultimately into digital hybrid forms as an agent-based artificial life with collective behaviors.

A central challenge in this context is ensuring fair outcomes, which often requires balancing conflicting preferences of various stakeholders. While extensive research has been conducted on theoretical and algorithmic solutions within the fair division framework, much of this work neglects the subjective perception of fairness by individuals. This study focuses on the fairness notion of envy-freeness (EF), which ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent according to their own preferences. While the existence of exact EF allocations may not always be feasible, various approximate relaxations, such as counterfactual and epistemic EF, have been proposed. Through a series of experiments with human participants, we compare perceptions of fairness between three widely studied counterfactual and epistemic relaxations of EF. Our findings indicate that allocations based on epistemic EF are perceived as fairer than those based on counterfactual relaxations. Additionally, we examine a variety of factors, including scale, balance of outcomes, and cognitive effort involved in evaluating fairness and their role in the complexity of reasoning across treatments.",TOPIC

The system integrates a top-down vision approach using a Basler a2A1920-160ucBAS camera, where a YOLOv11 object detection model—trained on a custom dataset with two classes (robot and toy)—is used to localize both entities in real time. A homography-based camera calibration process maps fisheye image coordinates to world positions, which are processed in a ROS-based architecture. Path planning is performed using the Improved RRT* with Reduced Random Map Size (IRRT*-RRMS) algorithm, while motion control combines Vector Field Histogram (VFH) for obstacle avoidance with a Pure Pursuit controller for trajectory tracking.

The model uses past data from the Ghana Meteorological Agency to forecast future temperatures, rainfall, and a composite resilience index made up of crop yield, transport delay, labor availability, market price volatility, and storage capacity. The model architecture includes regularization methods like Batch Normalization, Gaussian Noise, and Layer Normalization. It then uses multi-output dense layers for tasks that need to make predictions at the same time. The model performed well in predicting the resilience index, with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.0819, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0687, and a R2 score of 0.0697. The proposed BiLSTM model outperformed the persistent baseline naive model. Predictions of raw climate variables weren’t very accurate because they are naturally unstable. However, the resilience index, which is a smoothed composite metric, was predicted with more consistency. These results show that BiLSTM-based models could help with climate-resilient agricultural planning and decision-making in places like Northern Ghana, where there isn’t a lot of data and the climate is unreliable.",TOPIC

This study uses neural network simulations to examine the relative impact of various components using a feature evaluation based on machine learning. Neural network simulations yielded high predictive accuracy, with correlation coefficients (R) ranging from 0.97294 to 0.99084 and mean squared errors (MSE) between 0.014255 and 0.024731, validating the robustness of the model. Results indicate that the absence of a Project Procurement Management Plan (PPMP) and Annual Procurement Plan preparation is the most critical parameter in implementation requirements. In fund management, interagency funds not taken up in trust accounts emerged as the most influential factor, highlighting potential financial inefficiencies. Architectural \&amp; Engineering (A&amp;E) and Administration \&amp; Supervision (A&amp;S) expense allocations were found to be the primary determinants in the budget allocation category. For procurement of equipment, supplies, materials, and services, the absence of lease-to-own agreements significantly impacts cost-effective resource acquisition. Additionally, deviations from audit guidelines in rental fee disbursements pose financial accountability risks in the authority to charge fees for equipment rental. These results highlight the necessity of better financial supervision, procurement planning, and regulatory compliance to increase the efficiency and transparency of infrastructure projects, offering policymakers and agency administrators practical insights.",TOPIC
10.1145/3762657,Grasp-HGN: Grasping the Unexpected,"For transradial amputees, robotic prosthetic hands promise to regain the capability to perform daily living activities. To advance next-generation prosthetic hand control design, it is crucial to address current shortcomings in robustness to out of lab artifacts, and generalizability to new environments. Due to the fixed number of object to interact with in existing datasets, contrasted with the virtually infinite variety of objects encountered in the real world, current grasp models perform poorly on unseen objects, negatively affecting users’ independence and quality of life.To address this: (i) we define semantic projection, the ability of a model to generalize to unseen object types and show that conventional models like YOLO, despite 80\% training accuracy, drop to 15\% on unseen objects. (ii) We propose Grasp-LLaVA, a Grasp Vision Language Model enabling human-like reasoning to infer the suitable grasp type estimate based on the object’s physical characteristics resulting in a significant 50.2\% accuracy over unseen object types compared to 36.7\% accuracy of an SOTA grasp estimation model.Lastly, to bridge the performance-latency gap, we propose Hybrid Grasp Network (HGN), an edge-cloud deployment infrastructure enabling fast grasp estimation on edge and accurate cloud inference as a fail-safe, effectively expanding the latency vs. accuracy Pareto. HGN with confidence calibration (DC) enables dynamic switching between edge and cloud models, improving semantic projection accuracy by 5.6\% (to 42.3\%) with 3.5\texttimes{} speedup over the unseen object types. Over a real-world sample mix, it reaches 86\% average accuracy (12.2\% gain over edge-only), and 2.2\texttimes{} faster inference than Grasp-LLaVA alone.",TOPIC

Data exchange between these diverse geographic information systems allows for the creation of synthetic simulation scenarios that can evoke realistic locomotion and task behavior from real, physically involved human users.

The traditional U-Net model suffers from mask discontinuity and edge blurring when recognizing crop rows in complex field environments, which seriously affects the accuracy and stability of path planning. To solve this problem, an improved U-Net algorithm (HSA-Unet) based on the Hybrid Spatial Attention mechanism (HSA) is proposed for enhancing the coherence and structural robustness of the crop row mask in the radish harvester path planning task. Meanwhile, a radish row image dataset containing eight typical changing scenarios, such as different light conditions, weed interference, and row breakage, was constructed to comprehensively evaluate the model's adaptability in the complex field environment. In addition, the centerline of the crop rows for the model prediction mask was determined by the triangular scanning method, and an End-of-Row (EOR) detection method combining continuous frame detection and odometer constraints was designed to achieve reliable identification of the end of the radish rows and automatic triggering of row change signals. The results of systematic experiments conducted on the Gazebo simulation platform show that HSA-Unet achieves an average IoU of 35.65\% in the turnip row segmentation task, which is better than the 27.08\% of the traditional U-Net, and the stability of mask prediction is significantly enhanced. Meanwhile, the mobile platform achieves a path planning quality score of 0.86 under different initial yaw angles (±20°), demonstrating good heading adaptive capability and dynamic path adjustment.

To address the limitations of traditional single-sensor data and insufficient target recognition accuracy, a master-slave robot cooperative control strategy based on multi-source data fusion and dynamic target recognition is proposed. The strategy employs a data fusion algorithm combining Extended Kalman Filter and Particle Filter to effectively integrate information from LiDAR, RGB-D cameras, and IMU sensors. A dynamic target recognition model based on YOLOv5 is constructed, incorporating the DeepSORT tracking algorithm to achieve real-time target tracking and state prediction. A hierarchical cooperative control architecture based on Contract Net Protocol is designed, where the master robot undertakes global task planning and resource scheduling, while slave robots execute local path planning and precise operation control.

10.1177/0278364920963783,Hybrid conditional planning for robotic applications,"Robots who have partial observability of and incomplete knowledge about their environments may have to consider contingencies while planning, and thus necessitate cognitive abilities beyond classical planning. Moreover, during planning, they need to consider continuous feasibility checks for executability of the plans in the real world. Conditional planning is concerned with reaching goals from an initial state, in the presence of incomplete knowledge and partial observability, by considering all contingencies and by utilizing sensing actions to gather relevant knowledge when needed. A conditional plan is essentially a tree of actions where each branch of the tree represents a possible execution of actuation actions and sensing actions to reach a goal state. Hybrid conditional planning extends conditional planning by integrating feasibility checks into executability conditions of actions. We introduce a parallel offline algorithm, called HCPlan, for computing hybrid conditional plans. HCPlan relies on modeling deterministic effects of actuation actions and non-deterministic effects of sensing actions in the causality-based action language (Formula presented.). Branches of a hybrid conditional plan are computed in parallel using a SAT solver, where continuous feasibility checks are performed as needed. We develop a comprehensive benchmark suite and introduce new evaluation metrics for hybrid conditional planning. We evaluate HCPlan with extensive experiments in terms of computational efficiency and plan quality. We perform experiments to compare HCPlan with other related conditional planners and approaches to deal with contingencies due to incomplete knowledge. We further demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of HCPlan in service robotics applications, through dynamic simulations and physical implementations. © The Author(s) 2020.",TOPIC

However, their data-centric nature still hinders them from generalizing well to ever-changing environments. Moreover, labeling data for robotic tasks is often impractical and expensive. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new self-supervised neuro-symbolic (NeSy) computational framework, imperative learning (IL), for robot autonomy, leveraging the generalization abilities of symbolic reasoning. The framework of IL consists of three primary components: a neural module, a reasoning engine, and a memory system. We formulate IL as a special bilevel optimization (BLO), which enables reciprocal learning over the three modules. This overcomes the label-intensive obstacles associated with data-driven approaches and takes advantage of symbolic reasoning concerning logical reasoning, physical principles, geometric analysis, etc. We discuss several optimization techniques for IL and verify their effectiveness in five distinct robot autonomy tasks including path planning, rule induction, optimal control, visual odometry, and multi-robot routing. Through various experiments, we show that IL can significantly enhance robot autonomy capabilities and we anticipate that it will catalyze further research across diverse domains. © The Author(s) 2025",TOPIC

In this work, we address this challenge by learning to predict a small set of objects that, taken together, would be sufficient for finding a plan. We propose a graph neural network architecture for predicting object importance in a single inference pass, thus incurring little overhead while greatly reducing the number of objects that must be considered by the planner. Our approach treats the planner and transition model as black boxes, and can be used with any off-the-shelf planner. Empirically, across classical planning, probabilistic planning, and robotic task and motion planning, we find that our method results in planning that is significantly faster than several baselines, including other partial grounding strategies and lifted planners. We conclude that learning to predict a sufficient set of objects for a planning problem is a simple, powerful, and general mechanism for planning in large instances.

The concept of CRM is recently proposed in literature for single-agent MRAC problems, where the reference model (leader) gets feedback from the plant (agent/follower) to facilitate improved transient performance. This work coins the concept of CRM based distributed MRAC, where it is assumed that the leader/reference model is connected only to a subset of followers and incorporates feedback from them in a multi-agent setting. Distributed parameter estimator and controller are designed, which incorporate inter-agent cooperation via communication over a bi-directional graph. The leader state and the time-varying leader input (also known as reference input in MRAC literature) are only accessible to its neighbours. A novel distributed dynamic surface control (DSC)-like strategy is invoked for each follower to cooperatively estimate the unknown reference input required for control design. Simulation results dictate that the proposed closed-loop leader based formulation leads to better transient performance as compared to the status quo and also enables the use of high gain tuners for adaptive update law.

We generalize existing work by allowing the agent’s dynamics to vary throughout the environment, leading to a hybrid dynamical system. This introduces an additional layer of complexity towards the planning portion of the problem: we must not only identify in which order to visit the points of interest, but also in which order to traverse the regions. We propose a tailored global path planner and prove that it is not only probabilistically complete, but converges in probability to a time-optimal solution. We then design an offline sequence planner together with an online trajectory optimizer. Simulations validate the results.",TOPIC

Additionally, this study introduces a polyvinyl alcohol cryogel (PVA-C) breast phantom based on the segmentation of the DNN automated approach, enabling the experiments of navigation systems for robotic breast surgery. Multi-modality breast MRI datasets of T2W and STIR images were acquired from 10 patients. Segmentation evaluation utilized the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), segmentation accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. First, a single class labeling was used to segment the breast region. Then it was employed as an input for three-class labeling to segment fat, fibroglandular (FGT) tissues, and tumorous lesions.

Firstly, by introducing spatial attention mechanism, positional attention mechanism and channel attention mechanism, a hybrid attention module is designed. This module not only establishes feature relationship between different locations, but also provides adaptive feature weights to highlight key information. Next, by embedding the hybrid attention module into the generative adversarial network, an improved generative adversarial network model is developed.

Developing software for such robots involves the design of task planning paradigms and the implementation of robotic software architectures, making software development rather tricky and time-consuming. In recent decades, component-based software development approaches have been increasingly adopted in robotics to improve software development efficiency by reusing data and controlling flows between components. However, few works have tackled the more critical issue of reusing complex high-level task planning paradigms and robotic software architectures. To make up for the limitation, this paper first identifies the mainstream task planning paradigms and proposes a set of novel patterns for interaction pipelines between the robotic functions of sensing, planning, and acting. Then this paper presents a novel Behavior Tree (BT) based development framework Structural-BT, which provides a set of reusable BT structures that implement abstract interaction pipelines while maintaining interfaces for task-specific customization. The Structural-BT framework supports the modular design of structure functionalities and allows easy extensibility of the inner planning flows between BT components. With the Structural-BT framework, software engineers can develop robotic software by flexibly composing BT structures to formulate the skeleton software architecture and implement task-specific algorithms when necessary. In the experiment, this paper develops robotic software for diverse task scenarios and selects the baseline approaches of Robot Operating System (ROS) and classical BT development frameworks for comparison. By quantitatively measuring the reuse frequencies and ratios of BT structures, the Structural-BT framework has been shown to be more efficient than the baseline approaches for robotic software development.",TOPIC

The verification environment is containerized for both cloud and edge computing using Docker to enable system portability and to handle, at run-time, the resources allocated for verification. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed architecture have been evaluated on a complex distributed system implementing a mobile robot path planner based on 3D simultaneous localization and mapping.",TOPIC

To obtain a clear view of the ultrasound image, an examiner needs to press the ultrasound (US) probe with a constant press and move smoothly and continuously. To mitigate the workload and prepare the remote treatment, there has been a demand for an automatic diagnostic scanning robotic system (ADSRS) using US images. For the complete ADSRS, the target localization, path planning, robot control, and US image analysis need to be addressed. This paper explains mainly the robot control part as the preliminary research toward ADSRS. A simple path was selected within a predefined inspection area as the preliminary work and the selected path was converted from the camera coordinates into the robot coordinates. Both the position and orientation of the US probe were used as the desired path. For the robot control, hybrid force-positon control was implemented to guarantee the quality of US images and the safety of patients. For the position control, the built-in Cartesian impedance control and null space control were utilized to control the 7-degree-of-ffeedom (7-DOF) manipulator. For the force control, the basic proportional control was implemented, and it was integrated with the aforementioned position control system. The experimental evaluation was conducted by using a 7-DOF manipulator with a joint torque sensor at each joint after attaching a US probe and a 3-dimensional (3-D) camera to an end-effector. The simple path over the surface of the skin of the patient was generated successfully, and the desired force during movement was set to 5N. The error is measured to $0.3144\pm 0.4853$ N.

This paper presents the design of a novel artificial muscle utilizing a single wire of shape memory alloy (SMA) wound in a spiral pattern. The actuator consists of two spiral windings of a single continuous SMA wire in two parallel plans (plan A and Plan B). Two groups of roller bearings are arranged in two halves of hexagons shapes for the guidance of the SMA wire in the two spiral shapes, enabling SMA spiral winding, while a third group of roller bearings are movable in middle output stage. This output stage is strategically placed between the two SMA spirals, enabling output motion. When the SMA wire is heated, it contracts, resulting in linear motion of the movable part along the axle (maximum stroke of 25 mm, and maximum load of 7 kgf). The displacement and force exerted by the actuator are adapted by adjusting the length of the SMA wire and the configuration of the output pulleys. Upon cooling, the movable part returns to its initial position under external loading. Moreover, system identification and PID control techniques are employed to enhance the actuator's control performance. Experimental tests conducted in both open-loop and closed-loop controls validate the actuator's ability to successfully follow desired trajectories. The key contribution of this work lies in the novel spiral architecture, which offers a vital and practical solution to deal with the limitations related to size and strain of the SMA wire while leveraging the unique properties of SMA technology.",TOPIC

This review synthesizes more than a decade of progress in vision-based robotic navigation through an engineering lens, charting the full pipeline from sensing to deployment. We first examine the expanding sensor palette—monocular and multi-camera rigs, stereo and RGB-D devices, LiDAR–camera hybrids, event cameras, and infrared systems—highlighting the complementary operating envelopes and the rise of learning-based depth inference. The advances in visual localization and mapping are then analyzed, contrasting sparse and dense SLAM approaches, as well as monocular, stereo, and visual–inertial formulations. Additional topics include loop closure, semantic mapping, and LiDAR–visual–inertial fusion, which enables drift-free operation in dynamic environments. Building on these foundations, we review the navigation and control strategies, spanning classical planning, reinforcement and imitation learning, hybrid topological–metric memories, and emerging visual language guidance. Application case studies—autonomous driving, industrial manipulation, autonomous underwater vehicles, planetary rovers, aerial drones, and humanoids—demonstrate how tailored sensor suites and algorithms meet domain-specific constraints.

Using a UR3e robot equipped with an RG2 gripper, we constructed a large-scale dataset of over 100,000 collision-free trajectories generated with MoveIt-integrated OMPL planners. These trajectories were used to train a DRL agent via curriculum learning and expert demonstrations. Both approaches were evaluated on key metrics such as planning time, success rate, and trajectory smoothness. Results show that the DRL-based planner achieves higher success rates and significantly lower planning times, producing more compact and deterministic trajectories. Time-optimal parameterization using TOPPRA ensured the dynamic feasibility of all trajectories. While classical planners retain advantages in zero-shot adaptability and environmental generality, our findings highlight the potential of DRL for real-time and high-throughput motion planning in industrial contexts.

10.3390/s25206476,Probabilistic Sampling Networks for Hybrid Structure Planning in Semi-Structured Environments,"Highlights: What are the main findings? A hybrid structure planning method based on a Probabilistic Sampling Network (PSNet) and an Enhanced Artificial Potential Field (EAPF) is proposed to address high-dimensional robot motion planning in semi-structured environments. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms MPNet and RRT-Connect in both 2-D point-mass robot and 6-DOF manipulator tasks, achieving higher success rates and more stable collision avoidance. What is the implication of the main finding? The proposed approach enhances the adaptability and robustness of industrial robots in intelligent manufacturing, maintaining efficient path planning in dynamic and complex scenarios. This study provides a new perspective for integrating learning-based methods with classical planning techniques, laying the foundation for future applications in autonomous robotic operations and human–robot collaboration. The advancement of adaptable industrial robots in intelligent manufacturing is hindered by the inefficiency of traditional motion planning methods in high-dimensional spaces. Therefore, a Dempster–Shafer evidence theory-based hybrid motion planner is proposed, in which a probabilistic sampling network (PSNet) and an enhanced artificial potential field (EAPF) cooperate with each other to improve the planning performance. The PSNet architecture comprises two modules: a motion planning module (MPM) and a fusion sampling module (FSM). The MPM utilizes sensor data alongside the robot’s current and target configurations to recursively generate diverse multimodal distributions of the next configuration. Based on the distribution information, the FSM was used as a decision-maker to ultimately generate globally connectable paths. Moreover, the FSM is equipped to correct collision path points caused by network inaccuracies through Gaussian resampling. Simultaneously, an augmented artificial potential field with a dynamic rotational field is deployed to repair local paths when worst-case collision scenarios occur. This collaborative strategy harmoniously unites the complementary strengths of both components, thereby enhancing the overall resilience and adaptability of the motion planning system. Experiments were conducted in various environments. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can quickly find directly connectable paths in diverse environments while reliably avoiding sudden obstacles. © 2025 by the authors.",TOPIC

This report focuses on the automation of remotely operated vehicle (ROV) manipulator operations for targeted biological sample-collection-and-return from the seafloor. In the context of future extraterrestrial exploration missions to ocean worlds, an ROV is an analog to a planetary lander, which must be capable of high-level autonomy.

Although these models have been successfully used to study the spreading dynamics such as viral marketing, there are many real scenarios (e.g. vaccination, evacuation) that require a more complex model. Hence, we propose a new hybrid framework that combines diffusion modelling with cognitive agent modelling. The hybrid, generic framework is grounded on BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention), an advanced, efficient cognitive agent framework. We demonstrate our framework to a wildfire evacuation case study consisting of 5,000 agents. We then compare and analyse the diffusion outcomes of our model against two baseline models, the standard Linear Threshold (LT) model and a slightly modified version of the LT model, across 17 different input configurations. The results show (statistically) significant differences with the baselines for the majority of the configurations, highlighting the need for cognitive agents in diffusion modelling.

10.5555/3398761.3398771,Explainable Multi Agent Path Finding,"Multi Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of planning paths for agents to reach their targets from their start locations, such that the agents do not collide while executing the plan. In safety-critical systems, the plan is typically checked by a human supervisor, who decides on whether to allow its execution. In such cases, we wish to convince the human that the plan is indeed collision free.To this end, we propose an explanation scheme for MAPF, which bases explanations on simplicity of visual verification by human's cognitive process. The scheme decomposes a plan into segments such that within each segment, the paths of the agents are disjoint. Then, we can convince the supervisor that the plan is collision free using a small number of images (dubbed an explanation). In addition, we can measure the simplicity of a plan by the number of segments required for the decomposition. We study the complexity of algorithmic problems that arise by the explanation scheme, as well as the tradeoff between the length (makespan) of a plan and its minimal decomposition. We also provide experimental results of our scheme both in a continuous and in a discrete setting.",TOPIC

Optimally scheduling the day's agenda typically requires a high cognitive load, where people reason about all their constraints at once. An agent that aids a person in scheduling the day's agenda can potentially reduce the stress associated with scheduling but must be able to 1) perform fast updates and 2) produce new agendas that can be readily understood by the people they are helping. In order to understand how people reason about agenda changes, we first performed a study where participants are asked to perform a series of scheduling tasks and captured their update strategy both subjectively (self-reporting) and objectively (by tracking their reasoning). Our results that show that people use spatial cues and meeting time information to reduce the rescheduling task to a more reasonable size. We then present a novel heuristic for adding tasks to agendas that targets rescheduling to clusters of appointments that are spatio-temporally near the new task.We show that this heuristic approach always finds the optimal solution, while greatly reducing rescheduling time, and performs rescheduling in a way that is similar to our participants' strategies.",TOPIC

Hence, a swarm of drones could be deployed in mission-critical operations in times of urgency for a secured and robust distributed-intercommunication which is essential for survivability and successful completion of missions. In this paper, a distributed-agent-based framework for secure and reliable information exchange between drones in a constellation is proposed.

We consider two dialogue participants who may have different views regarding the beliefs, plans and external events which drove agent action (encoded via traces). These participants make utterances which incrementally reveal their traces to each other, allowing them to identify divergences in the traces, or to conclude that their traces agree. In practice, we envision a human taking on the role of a dialogue participant, with the BDI agent itself acting as the other participant. The dialogue then facilitates explanation, understanding and debugging of BDI agent behaviour.

Based on this insight, we propose Grid-to-Graph (GTG), a mapping from grid structures to relational graphs that carry useful spatial relational inductive biases when processed through a Relational Graph Convolution Network (R-GCN). We show that, with GTG, R-GCNs generalize better both in terms of in-distribution and out-of-distribution compared to baselines based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Neural Logic Machines on challenging procedurally generated environments and MinAtar.

Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has been shown to be a promising approach to the intention progression problem, out-performing other approaches in the literature. However, MCTS relies on runtime simulation of possible interleavings of the plans in each intention, which may be computationally costly. In this paper, we introduce the notion of quantitative summary information which can be used to estimate the likelihood of conflicts between an agent's intentions. We show how offline simulation can be used to precompute quantitative summary information prior to execution of the agent's program, and how the precomputed summary information can be used at runtime to guide the expansion of the MCTS search tree and avoid unnecessary runtime simulation. We compare the performance of our approach with standard MCTS in a range of scenarios of increasing difficulty. The results suggest our approach can significantly improve the efficiency of MCTS in terms of the number of runtime simulations performed.",TOPIC

Simulation of these hybrid control approaches to robotics can be a useful validation tool for robot users and architecture designers, but presents the key challenge of working with discrete and continuous representations of the robot, its environment and its mission plans. In this work we address this challenge showcasing a unified DEVS-based hybrid simulation platform. We model and simulate the hybrid robotic software architecture of a fixed-wing UAV, including the full stack of controllers involved: discrete, hybrid and continuous. We validate the approach experimentally on a typical UAV mapping mission and show that with our unified approach we are able to achieve simulation speed-ups up to one order of magnitude above our previous Software In The Loop simulation setup.",TOPIC
10.5555/3522802.3522882,Systemic characteristics to support hybrid simulation modeling,"Hybrid simulation (HS) is a modeling approach based on combining System Dynamics, Discrete Event Simulation, and/or Agent Based Simulation into a single model. There have been many benefits identified for utilization HS for planning and decision-making across many sectors. However, the lead time and skills requirements for developing HS models is usually greater than single methodology models. This position paper proposes that in order to improve and speed up the development of HS models, the decision to hybridize should be taken at the earliest possible point, i.e. when investigating the system and defining the problem. To this end, five system based characteristics have been proposed as decision points that help modelers to make such decisions. The paper concludes by suggesting a number of research avenues to follow for further improvements, whilst highlighting further challenges related to the availability of skills and tools for developing HS models.",TOPIC
10.5555/3523760.3523782,"Why do We Follow Robots? An Experimental Investigation of Conformity with Robot, Human, and Hybrid Majorities","Individuals tend to conform to a majority for reasons of peer pressure (normative conformity) and insecurity (informational conformity). It is important to investigate the reasons for social phenomena such as conformity in order to better understand processes in hybrid teams (i.e., teams which consist of humans and robots). Research has yielded conflicting results on conformity with robot and hybrid majorities, and the reasons for conformity remain unclear. We conducted a within-subject online experiment (n = 103) to compare the reasons for conformity under three conditions: human, robot, and hybrid majorities. Results indicate that subjects conformed most often with hybrid majorities, while they conformed least often with robot majorities. Normative conformity influenced conformity with human majorities, but informational conformity did not. Informational conformity influenced conformity with robot majorities, but normative conformity did not. Both types of conformity affected conformity with hybrid majorities. Our results provide a possible explanation for the heterogeneous findings on conformity in HRI",TOPIC
10.5555/3523760.3523794,Mind the Machines: Applying Implicit Measures of Mind Perception in Social Robotics,"Beyond conscious beliefs and goals, automatic cognitive processes shape our social encounters, and interactions with complex machines like social robots are no exception. With this in mind, it is surprising that research in human-robot interaction (HRI) almost exclusively uses explicit measures, such as subjective ratings and questionnaires, to assess human attitudes towards robots - seemingly ignoring the importance of implicit measures. This is particularly true for research focusing on the question whether or not humans are willing to attribute complex mental states (i.e.,mind perception ), such asagency (i.e., the capacity to plan and act) andexperience (i.e., the capacity to sense and feel), to robotic agents. In the current study, we (i) created the mind perception implicit association test (MP-IAT) to examine subconscious attributions of mental capacities to agents of different degrees of human-likeness (here: human vs. humanoid robot), and (ii) compared the outcomes of the MP-IAT to explicit mind perception ratings of the same agents. Results indicate that (i) already at the subconscious level, robots are associated with lower levels of agency and experience compared to humans, and that (ii) implicit and explicit measures of mind perception are not significantly correlated. This suggests that mind perception (i) has an implicit component that can be measured using implicit tests like the IAT and (ii) might be difficult to modulate via design or experimental procedures due to its fast-acting, automatic nature.",TOPIC
10.5555/3535850.3535914,Intention-Aware Navigation in Crowds with Extended-Space POMDP Planning,"This paper presents a hybrid online Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) planning system that addresses the problem of autonomous navigation in the presence of multi-modal uncertainty introduced by other agents in the environment. As a particular example, we consider the problem of autonomous navigation in dense crowds of pedestrians and among obstacles. Popular approaches to this problem first generate a path using a complete planner (e.g., Hybrid A*) with ad-hoc assumptions about uncertainty, then use online tree-based POMDP solvers to reason about uncertainty with control over a limited aspect of the problem (i.e. speed along the path). We present a more capable and responsive real-time approach enabling the POMDP planner to control more degrees of freedom (e.g., both speed AND heading) to achieve more flexible and efficient solutions. This modification greatly extends the region of the state space that the POMDP planner must reason over, significantly increasing the importance of finding effective roll-out policies within the limited computational budget that real time control affords. Our key insight is to use multi-query motion planning techniques (e.g., Probabilistic Roadmaps or Fast Marching Method) as priors for rapidly generating efficient roll-out policies for every state that the POMDP planning tree might reach during its limited horizon search. Our proposed approach generates trajectories that are safe and significantly more efficient than the previous approach, even in densely crowded dynamic environments with long planning horizons.",TOPIC
10.5555/3535850.3535982,Using Deep Learning to Bootstrap Abstractions for Hierarchical Robot Planning,"This paper addresses the problem of learning abstractions that boost robot planning performance while providing strong guarantees of reliability. Although state-of-the-art hierarchical robot planning algorithms allow robots to efficiently compute long-horizon motion plans for achieving user desired tasks, these methods typically rely upon environment-dependent state and action abstractions that need to be hand-designed by experts.We present a new approach for bootstrapping the entire hierarchical planning process. This allows us to compute abstract states and actions for new environments automatically using the critical regions predicted by a deep neural network with an auto-generated robot-specific architecture. We show that the learned abstractions can be used with a novel multi-source bi-directional hierarchical robot planning algorithm that is sound and probabilistically complete. An extensive empirical evaluation on twenty different settings using holonomic and non-holonomic robots shows that (a) our learned abstractions provide the information necessary for efficient multi-source hierarchical planning; and that (b) this approach of learning, abstractions, and planning outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by nearly a factor of ten in terms of planning time on test environments not seen during training.",TOPIC
10.5555/3535850.3535992,Socially Supervised Representation Learning: The Role of Subjectivity in Learning Efficient Representations,"Despite its rise as a prominent solution to the data inefficiency of today's machine learning models, self-supervised learning has yet to be studied from a purely multi-agent perspective. In this work, we propose that aligning internal subjective representations, which naturally arise in a multi-agent setup where agents receive partial observations of the same underlying environmental state, can lead to more data-efficient representations. We propose that multi-agent environments, where agents do not have access to the observations of others but can communicate within a limited range, guarantees a common context that can be leveraged in individual representation learning. The reason is that subjective observations necessarily refer to the same subset of the underlying environmental states and that communication about these states can freely offer a supervised signal. To highlight the importance of communication, we refer to our setting associally supervised representation learning. We present a minimal architecture comprised of a population of autoencoders, where we define loss functions, capturing different aspects of effective communication, and examine their effect on the learned representations. We show that our proposed architecture allows the emergence of aligned representations. The subjectivity introduced by presenting agents with distinct perspectives of the environment state contributes to learning abstract representations that outperform those learned by a single autoencoder and a population of autoencoders, presented with identical perspectives of the environment state. Altogether, our results demonstrate how communication from subjective perspectives can lead to the acquisition of more abstract representations in multi-agent systems, opening promising perspectives for future research at the intersection of representation learning and emergent communication.",TOPIC
10.5555/3545946.3598826,Intelligent Onboard Routing in Stochastic Dynamic Environments using Transformers,"Autonomous marine agents find extensive applications in environmental data collection, naval security, and exploration of harsh ocean regions. As intelligent agents, they must perform onboard routing, collect data about their surroundings and update their route to minimize mission travel time, energy, or data collection. While Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are often used for path planning, they are computationally expensive for onboard routing as they need in-mission re-planning. In the present paper, we develop a novel, deep learning method based on the decision transformers for optimal path planning and onboard routing of autonomous marine agents. The transformer architectures convert the RL-based optimal path planning problem into a supervised learning problem via sequence modeling. Before the mission, during the offline planning phase, the environment is first modeled as a stochastic dynamic ocean flow with dynamically orthogonal flow equations. A training dataset for the transformer model is created by solving the stochastic dynamically orthogonal Hamilton-Jacobi level set partial differential equations or a dynamic programming solution for MDPs. These paths are then processed to obtain sequences of states, actions and returns for our transformer models, where the agent's state is typically its spatio-temporal coordinate and other collectible data. We propose and analyze multiple state modeling choices against the agent's state estimation capabilities and scenarios with multiple target locations. We demonstrate that (i) a trained agent learns to infer the surrounding flow and perform optimal onboard routing when the agent's state estimation is accurate,(ii) specifying the target locations (in case of multiple targets) as a part of the state enables a trained agent to route itself to the correct destination, and (iii) a trained agent is robust to limited noise in state transitions and is capable of reaching target locations in completely new flow scenarios. We extensively showcase end-to-end planning and onboard routing in various canonical and idealized ocean flow scenarios. We analyze the predictions of the transformer models and explain the inner mechanics of learning through a novel visualization of self-attention of actions and states on the trajectories.",TOPIC
10.5555/3546258.3546359,LocalGAN: modeling local distributions for adversarial response generation,"This paper presents a new methodology for modeling the local semantic distribution of responses to a given query in the human-conversation corpus, and on this basis, explores a specified adversarial learning mechanism for training Neural Response Generation (NRG) models to build conversational agents. Our investigation begins with the thorough discussions upon the objective function of general Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) architectures, and the training instability problem is proved to be highly relative with the special local distributions of conversational corpora. Consequently, an energy function is employed to estimate the status of a local area restricted by the query and its responses in the semantic space, and the mathematical approximation of this energy-based distribution is finally found. Building on this foundation, a local distribution oriented objective is proposed and combined with the original objective, working as a hybrid loss for the adversarial training of response generation models, named as LocalGAN. Our experimental results demonstrate that the reasonable local distribution modeling of the query-response corpus is of great importance to adversarial NRG, and our proposed LocalGAN is promising for improving both the training stability and the quality of generated results.",TOPIC

The Segment Routing architecture is exploited to manage the uncoordinated selection of rerouting performed by different nodes, thus avoiding the creation of routing loops, while the Extensible In-band Processing is used to allow the network nodes to have a detailed and updated view of the wide network status. Data and control plane programmability are considered to define a prototype implementation of QLR that allows for the execution of a preliminary performance evaluation and proof-of-concept. From the conducted experiments has emerged that QLR can effectively reduce the maximum queue occupancy and end-to-end delay up to 43\% and 63\%, respectively.",TOPIC
10.5555/3635637.3662854,Willy Wonka Mechanisms,"Bounded rationality in mechanism design aims to ensure incentive-compatibility for agents who are cognitively limited. These agents lack the contingent reasoning skills that traditional mechanism design assumes, and depending on how these cognitive limitations are modelled this alters the class of incentive-compatible mechanisms. In this work we design mechanisms without any ''obvious'' manipulations for several auction settings that aim to either maximise revenue or minimise the compensation paid to the agents. A mechanism without obvious manipulations is said to be not obviously manipulable (NOM), and assumes agents act truthfully as long as the maximum and minimum utilities from doing so are no worse than the maximum and minimum utilities from lying, with the extremes taken over all possible actions of the other agents. We exploit the definition of NOM by introducing the concept of golden tickets and wooden spoons, which designate bid profiles ensuring the mechanism's incentive-compatibility for each agent. We then characterise these ''Willy Wonka'' mechanisms, and by carefully choosing the golden tickets and wooden spoons we use this to design revenue-maximising auctions and frugal procurement auctions.",TOPIC
10.5555/3635637.3662981,2D-Ptr: 2D Array Pointer Network for Solving the Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem,"The heterogeneous capacitated vehicle routing problem (HCVRP) aims to optimize the routes of heterogeneous vehicles with capacity constraints to serve a set of customers with demands. Existing learning-based methods for solving HCVRP have the problem of weak generalization ability, which means that well-trained model cannot adapt well to new scenarios with different vehicle or customer numbers. To address this issue, by modeling the simultaneous decision-making of multiple agents as a sequence of consecutive actions in real time, we propose a pointer network extension model, which includes a static encoder and a dynamic encoder to map the current situation to node embeddings and vehicle embeddings, respectively. For each element in the consecutive actions sequence, the decoder of our model uses the probability distribution obtained from node embeddings and vehicle embeddings as a 2D array pointer to select a tuple from the combinations of vehicles and nodes (customers and depot). We call this architecture a 2D Array Pointer network (2D-Ptr). Instead of planning paths based on the priority order of vehicles, 2D-Ptr plans paths based on the priority order of actions. In addition, 2D-Ptr consists of a series of carefully designed attention modules, entitling the model to be generalizable in the scenarios where additional vehicles (or customers) are introduced or existing vehicles (or customers) are removed. We empirically test 2D-Ptr and show its capability for producing near-optimal solutions through cooperative actions. 2D-Ptr delivers competitive performance against the state-of-the-art baselines, and can solve arbitrary instances of the HCVRP without requiring re-training.",TOPIC
10.5555/3635637.3663033,Modeling Cognitive Biases in Decision-theoretic Planning for Active Cyber Deception,"This paper presents an approach to modeling and exploiting cognitive biases of cyber attackers in planning for active deception. Sophisticated cyber attacks are primarily orchestrated by human actors. Hence, we focus on the human aspect of the attacker's decision-making process. Humans deviate from rational decision-making due to various cognitive biases. Here, we focus on fundamental attribution error (FAE) and confirmation bias and their role in cyber deception because these biases contribute to humans being deceived. We use the decision-theoretic planning framework of finitely-nested factored I-POMDP (I-POMDPχ), which allows us to explicitly model FAE in multi-agent settings and build cognitive models of the attackers. We show how these biases impact their beliefs as they act and obtain more information about the environment and the adversary. The tractability of the I-POMDPχ also allows for modeling agents at a higher strategy level where the optimal policy relies on induction and exploitation of these biases. Hence, we also present an I-POMDPχ-based rational defender agent that can model the attacker's beliefs under the influence of FAE and confirmation bias from a higher strategic level, and exploit them. Our experiments in simulated interactions show that the I-POMDPχ-based defender agent can induce FAE in an attacker to distort the attacker's beliefs. Consequently, the defender agent can exploit the attacker's cognitive biases to extend the duration of the attack to facilitate the attacker's intent recognition in a controlled environment. Our work provides a general decision-theoretic formulation of FAE and confirmation bias, and demonstrates its role in planning for agent-based active cyber deception.",TOPIC
10.5555/3635637.3663063,Attention-based Priority Learning for Limited Time Multi-Agent Path Finding,"Solving large-scale Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) within a limited time remains an open challenge, despite its importance for many robotic applications. Recent learning-based methods scale better than conventional ones, but remain suboptimal and often exhibit low success rates within a limited time on large-scale instances. These limitations often stem from their black-box nature. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach that incorporates prioritized planning with learning-based methods to explicitly address these challenges. We formulate prioritized planning as a Markov Decision Process and introduce a reinforcement learning-based prioritized planning paradigm. In doing so, we develop a novel Synthetic Score-based Attention Network (S2AN) to learn conflict/blocking relationships among agents, and deliver blocking-free priorities. By integrating priority mechanisms and leveraging a new attention-based neural network for enhanced multi-agent cooperative strategies, our method enhances solution completeness while trading off scalability and maintains linear time complexity, thus offering a robust avenue for large-scale MAPF tasks. Comparisons demonstrate its superiority over current learning-based methods in terms of solution quality, completeness, and reachability within limited time constraints, especially in large-scale scenarios. Moreover, an extensive set of numerical results reveals superior completeness compared to restricted-time Priority-Based Search (PBS) and Priority Inheritance with Backtracking (PIBT) in medium to large-scale obstacle-dense scenarios.",TOPIC
10.5555/3643142.3643315,Investigating Production Yield Effect on Inventory Control through a Hybrid Simulation Approach,"Production Planning and Control (PPC) plays a key role in stabilizing and improving manufacturing processes under external and internal uncertainties by providing transparency in the whole system. This study focuses on PPC with internal uncertainties such as losses of work-in-process products during a contact lens manufacturing process. Although such losses are expected, the yield rates are uncertain and vary at different production stages. A hybrid agent-based simulation (ABS) and discrete-event simulation (DES) approach was utilized to resemble the underlying dynamics of the manufacturing system with uncertain yield rates. The results of the simulation experiments demonstrated that a simple average yield approach for production planning would cause potential backlogs and extra holding costs for the excess inventory. The proposed hybrid simulation could be used to support the decision-making process on a weekly basis to help a production planning team make a schedule that would improve efficiency and customer satisfaction.",TOPIC

However, progress in algorithms and methods depends on the availability of standardized learning environments that represent skills relevant to RALS. We present LapGym, a framework for building RL environments for RALS that models the challenges posed by surgical tasks, and sofa_env, a diverse suite of 12 environments. Motivated by surgical training, these environments are organized into 4 tracks: Spatial Reasoning, Deformable Object Manipulation \& Grasping, Dissection, and Thread Manipulation. Each environment is highly parametrizable for increasing difficulty, resulting in a high performance ceiling for new algorithms. We use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to establish a baseline for model-free RL algorithms, investigating the effect of several environment parameters on task difficulty. Finally, we show that many environments and parameter configurations reect well-known, open problems in RL research, allowing researchers to continue exploring these fundamental problems in a surgical context. We aim to provide a challenging, standard environment suite for further development of RL for RALS, ultimately helping to realize the full potential of cognitive surgical robotics.

This paper proposes an agent-based model (ABM) design for simulating the smoking behaviors of a population using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation - Behavior (COM-B) model. Capability, Opportunity and Motivation are modeled as latent composite attributes which are composed of observable factors associated with smoking behaviors. Three forms of the COM-B model are proposed to explain the transitions between smoking behaviors: initiating regular smoking uptake, making a quit attempt and quitting successfully. The ABM design follows object-oriented principles and extends an existing generic software architecture for mechanism-based modeling. The potential of the model to assess the impact of smoking policies is illustrated and discussed.",TOPIC

Existing techniques for automatically debiasing ML models generally require access to either the models' internal architectures, the models' training datasets, or both. In this paper we outline the reasons why such requirements are disadvantageous, and present an alternative novel debiasing system that is both data- and model-agnostic. We implement this system as a Reinforcement Learning Agent and through extensive experiments show that we can debias a variety of target ML model architectures over three benchmark datasets. Our results show performance comparable to data- and/or model-gnostic state-of-the-art debiasers.",TOPIC

Over a decade later, formulating robot capabilities remains a significant technical hurdle in bringing robots from the lab into everyday life. This paper introduces Capabilities2, a successor to the original Capabilities package, now reimagined for ROS2. Capabilities2 enhances the original design by enabling advancements in skill-based control techniques and offering a more efficient, extensible framework for defining and utilising robot capabilities. We delve into its application in new real-world scenarios, with a particular focus on human-robot interactions and the deployment of collaborative mobile robots in human-centric environments. Capabilities2 addresses challenges in implementing intuitive, collaborative robots by introducing an abstracted database handler, an object-relational mapping for capability models, and a plugin architecture for capability execution. These features support dynamic capability representation, runtime adaptability, and integration with modern AI techniques for skill-based task planning. By providing a standardised yet flexible framework, Capabilities2 reduces the integration effort required to develop top-level controls for real-world scenarios, facilitating rapid development and deployment. Our contributions include the reimplementation of the Capabilities package in ROS2, enhancements to support contemporary robotic applications, and demonstrations of new use cases enabled by Capabilities2.

However, most VR learning environments lack real-time adaptability, personalization, and cognitive responsiveness. This study presents an Agentic AI-enabled VR framework that autonomously adjusts pedagogical content, interaction style, and challenge level based on learner behavior, emotions, and performance feedback. The proposed system integrates a reinforcement learning-based agent with a virtual reality module to form an intelligent tutor capable of independent decision-making. A neuro-symbolic model processes multi-modal feedback (gesture, speech, gaze, performance) to determine context-aware pedagogical strategies. The system employs a self-evolving curriculum logic that adapts in real time. Experiments are conducted using Unity3D integrated with Python-based RL agents and simulated student models. Results demonstrate a 35.7% improvement in learner retention and a 42.1% reduction in cognitive overload compared to traditional static VR systems. The agent successfully personalized 92.3% of scenarios without human intervention. Emotional adaptivity and dynamic pacing showed increased engagement and reduced frustration metrics among diverse learners. Agentic VR represents a paradigm shift in intelligent education systems, enabling autonomous, emotionally-aware, and responsive learning environments. The proposed framework outperforms conventional VR platforms by offering real-time adaptive learning without pre-scripted logic. Integrating reinforcement learning, neuro-symbolic reasoning, and affective feedback into a single VR space results in a novel contribution to adaptive educational technology. The reported metrics were obtained from an administrator-controlled user study of 10 participants (aged 18-25 years), all of whom participated in three VR-based learning experiences as described in a controlled evaluative protocol.
