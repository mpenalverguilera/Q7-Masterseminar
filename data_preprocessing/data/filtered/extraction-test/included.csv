10.1007/s10845-024-02494-0,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,"Self-organizing manufacturing network has emerged as a viable solution for adaptive manufacturing control within the mass personalization paradigm. This approach involves three critical elements: system modeling and control architecture, interoperable communication, and adaptive manufacturing control. However, current research often separates interoperable communication from adaptive manufacturing control as isolated areas of study. To address this gap, this paper introduces Knowledge Graph-enhanced Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method that integrates interoperable communication via Knowledge Graphs with adaptive manufacturing control through Reinforcement Learning. We hypothesize that implicit domain knowledge obtained from historical production job allocation records can guide each agent to learn more effective scheduling policies with accelerated learning rates. This is based on the premise that machine assignment preferences effectively could reduce the Reinforcement Learning search space. Specifically, we redesign machine agents with new observation, action, reward, and cooperation mechanisms considering the preference of machines, building upon our previous MARL base model. The scheduling policies are trained under extensive simulation experiments that consider manufacturing requirements. During the training process, our approach demonstrates improved training speed compared with individual Reinforcement Learning methods under the same training hyperparameters. The obtained scheduling policies generated by our Knowledge Graph-enhanced MARL also outperform both individual Reinforcement Learning methods and heuristic rules under dynamic manufacturing settings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1007/s10916-025-02255-3,Journal of Medical Systems,"This paper presents a trust-aware architecture for personalized digital health that combines user modeling, symbolic reasoning, and adaptive trust mechanisms. The proposed system uses Blueprint Personas to capture detailed patient profiles, including clinical, behavioral, and emotional traits. These profiles guide an intelligent agent that interacts with patients and healthcare professionals to provide context-sensitive support. Personalization is achieved through an ontology-based reasoning layer that interprets user needs and integrates real-time data from electronic health records, wearable devices, and environmental sources. To promote transparency and foster long-term user engagement, the system includes a formal trust modeling component based on a Reference Ontology of Trust (ROT), allowing the system to flexibly tailor communication strategies in response to user feedback and evolving trust levels. A simulated scenario involving a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates how the system delivers proactive and personalized healthcare interventions, such as medication reminders and air quality alerts. While the architecture is modular and designed for scalability, it has not yet been deployed in real-world clinical settings. Empirical validation and integration with clinical platforms remain part of future work. Nevertheless, this ongoing work contributes to the development of explainable and ethically aligned AI systems that enhance autonomy, accessibility, and trust in digital health environments through explainable reasoning. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.comcom.2025.108342,Computer Communications,"Large-scale low earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks constitute a core component of future sixth-generation (6G) communication systems. To address the challenges of resource scarcity and highly dynamic topologies, the integration of software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) technologies into LEO satellite networks has become imperative. We proposes a hybrid centralized-distributed software-defined LEO satellite network architecture. Within this framework, This study focuses on the service function chain (SFC) deployment problem in LEO space-ground integrated networks. time-expanded graphs (TEGs) are employed to model satellite networks with dynamic topological variations, aiming to satisfy diverse user requirements while jointly optimizing resource consumption costs and service latency. The problem is formulated as a weighted sum minimization of resource consumption costs and service latency, and this problem is proven to be NP-complete. Subsequently, we integrate the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient method with multi-agent techniques to design a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning SFC deployment (MADRL-D) framework for optimizing our objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MADRL-D framework outperforms existing alternatives in terms of resource utilization efficiency, resource consumption costs, and service latency. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",
10.1016/j.comnet.2025.111749,Computer Networks,"Large Language Model (LLM)-based autonomous agents are expected to play a vital role in the evolution of 6G networks, by empowering real-time decision-making related to management and service provisioning to end-users. This shift facilitates the transition from a specialized intelligence approach, where artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms handle isolated tasks, to artificial general intelligence (AGI)-driven networks, where agents possess broader reasoning capabilities and can manage diverse network functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel agentic paradigm that combines LLMs with real-time optimization algorithms towards Trustworthy AI, defined as symbiotic agents. Optimizers at the LLM's input-level provide bounded uncertainty steering for numerically precise tasks, whereas output-level optimizers supervised by the LLM enable adaptive real-time control. We design and implement two novel agent types including: (i) Radio Access Network (RAN) optimizers, and (ii) multi-agent negotiators for Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). We further propose an end-to-end architecture for AGI-driven networks and evaluate it on a 5G testbed capturing channel fluctuations from moving vehicles. Results show that symbiotic agents reduce decision errors fivefold compared to standalone LLM-based agents, while smaller language models (SLM) achieve similar accuracy with a 99.9 % reduction in Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) resource overhead and in near-real-time (near-RT) loops of 82ms. A multi-agent demonstration for collaborative RAN on the real-world testbed highlights significant flexibility in service-level agreement and resource allocation, reducing RAN over-utilization by approximately 44 %. Drawing on our findings and open-source implementations, we introduce the symbiotic paradigm as the foundation for next-generation, AGI-driven networks-systems designed to remain adaptable, efficient, and trustworthy even as LLMs advance.

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3011670,A Novel Multi-Agent Parallel-Critic Network Architecture for Cooperative-Competitive Reinforcement Learning,"Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MDRL) is an emerging research hotspot and application direction in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. MDRL covers many algorithms, rules and frameworks, it is currently researched in swarm system, energy allocation optimization, stocking analysis, sequential social dilemma, and with extremely bright future. In this paper, a parallel-critic method based on classic MDRL algorithm MADDPG is proposed to alleviate the training instability problem in cooperative-competitive multi-agent environment. Furthermore, a policy smoothing technique is introduced to our proposed method to decrease the variance of learning policies. The suggested method is evaluated in three different scenarios of authoritative multi-agent particle environment (MPE). Multiple statistical data of experimental results show that our method significantly improves the training stability and performance compared to vanilla MADDPG.",
10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3309417,Rational Coordination in Cognitive Agents: A Decision-Theoretic Approach Using ERMM,"Over the years, research in multi-agent systems has become increasingly popular. Agents evolve by interacting with their environment and must communicate with other agents in order to do various cooperative tasks. The research aims to provide efficient coordination among cooperative cognitive agents in unpredictable multi-agent situations. Xiang’s rational agent model addresses scenarios when no social conventions or predefined communication protocols exist for the agents’ interaction and then makes decisions by recursive modeling. We address the deficiencies of the loosely coupled framework and the problem of mispredictions in Xiang’s architecture. The solution is based on Lawniczak’s Architecture for generic cognitive agents and an enhanced model of Xiang’s Recursive Modeling Method for coordinated decision-making in multi-agent situations. We instruct the cognitive agent to learn about other agents from past mispredictions and then consider its best choice. The feedback module is incorporated so agents can learn to maximize their joint expected reward. The model filters the mispredictions and evaluates the error rate. We compare the enhanced method with the Recursive Modeling Method. The results show that mispredictions are corrected from 33% to 10.9% and errors in perception are reduced from 22% to 0.097%, as the system progresses. Overall, the approach demonstrates superior performance. It significantly lowers the rate of mispredictions about other agents’ actions and takes 30% to 42% less time and 55.4 % fewer moves than RMM.",
10.1109/TLT.2014.2367493,A Self-Adaptive Multi-Agent System Approach for Collaborative Mobile Learning,"Mobile technologies have emerged as facilitators in the learning process, extending traditional classroom activities. However, engineering mobile learning applications for outdoor usage poses severe challenges. The requirements of these applications are challenging, as many different aspects need to be catered, such as resource access and sharing, communication between peers, group management, activity flow, etc. Robustness is particularly important for learning scenarios to guarantee undisturbed and smooth user experiences, pushing the technological aspects in the background. Despite significant research in the field of mobile learning, very few efforts have focused on collaborative mobile learning requirements from a software engineering perspective. This paper focuses on aspects of the software architecture, aiming to address the challenges related to resource sharing in collaborative mobile learning activities. This includes elements such as autonomy for personal interactive learning, richness for large group collaborative learning (indoor and outdoor), as well as robustness of the learning system. Additionally, we present self-adaptation as a solution to mitigate risks of resource unavailability and organization failures that arise from environment and system dynamism. Our evaluation provides indications regarding the system correctness with respect to resource sharing and collaboration concerns, and offers qualitative evidence of self-adaptation benefits for collaborative mobile learning applications.",
10.1145/3649158.3657034,BlueSky: How to Raise a Robot - A Case for Neuro-Symbolic AI in Constrained Task Planning for Humanoid Assistive Robots,"Humanoid robots will be able to assist humans in their daily life, in particular due to their versatile action capabilities. However, while these robots need a certain degree of autonomy to learn and explore, they also should respect various constraints, for access control and beyond. We explore the novel field of incorporating privacy, security, and access control constraints with robot task planning approaches. We report preliminary results on the classical symbolic approach, deep-learned neural networks, and modern ideas using large language models as knowledge base. From analyzing their trade-offs, we conclude that a hybrid approach is necessary, and thereby present a new use case for the emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence.",
10.1145/3772077,LUMEN: Enhancing IoT System Observability with Multi-Agent Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs,"The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) systems has transformed industries through real-time monitoring and automation, generating vast and heterogeneous data streams. As IoT networks expand, the increasing volume and diversity of data, spanning real-time telemetry, device logs, and historical records, complicate the management of IoT systems, including system monitoring, analysis, and reasoning. To address this challenge, we introduce LUMEN (Large Language Models as Unified Multi-Agent Systems for IoT ENhancement), a novel approach combining multi-agent Large Language Models (LLMs), knowledge graphs, and heterogeneous databases to enable cognitive digital twins for IoT observability. LUMEN models IoT systems as knowledge graphs, capturing device relationships and metadata while monitoring data is stored in time-series or object databases. Specialized LLM-based agents collaborate dynamically to analyze IoT systems and explain the findings in natural language, generating and executing analysis code when necessary. Integrated with off-the-shelf network monitoring tools, LUMEN facilitates semantic reasoning and human-in-the-loop collaboration, delivering adaptive insights across diverse data contexts. Two industrial case studies demonstrate the ability of LUMEN to automate analysis workflows, enhance system adaptability, and provide interpretable analytics. This work advances IoT observability by integrating LLMs, semantic intelligence, and explainable analytics into a scalable and adaptive solution using a multi-agent architecture for complex IoT systems.",
