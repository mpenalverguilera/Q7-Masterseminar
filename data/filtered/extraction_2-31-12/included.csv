10.1002/wcs.1488,,"ACT-R is a hybrid cognitive architecture. It is comprised of a set of programmable information processing mechanisms that can be used to predict and explain human behavior including cognition and interaction with the environment. We start by reviewing its history, which shapes its current form, contrasts and relates it to other architectures, and helps readers to anticipate where it is going. Based on this history, we then describe it as a theory of cognition that is realized as a computer program. After this, we briefly discuss tools for working with ACT-R, and also note several major accomplishments that have been gained by working with ACT-R in both basic and applied science, including summarizing some of the insights about human behavior. We conclude by discussing its future, which we believe will include adding emotions and physiology, increasing usability, and the use of nongenerative models.

10.1109/ICPADS63350.2024.00042,,"In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown rapid development, becoming one of the most popular topics in the field of artificial intelligence. LLMs have demonstrated powerful generalization and learning capabilities, and their performance on various language tasks has been remarkable. Despite their successes, LLMs face significant challenges, particularly in domain-specific tasks that require structured knowledge, often leading to issues such as hallucinations. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel system, SynaptiQA, which integrates LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to answer more questions about knowledge. Our approach leverages the generative capabilities of LLMs to create and optimize KG queries, thereby improving the accuracy and contextual relevance of responses. Experimental results in an industrial data set demonstrate that SynaptiQA outperforms baseline models and naive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, demonstrating improved accuracy and reduced hallucinations. This integration of KGs with LLMs paves the way for more reliable and interpretable domain-specific question answering systems. © 2024 IEEE.",
