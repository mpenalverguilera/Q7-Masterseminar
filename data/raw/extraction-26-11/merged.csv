,Hardware Architecture of Graph Neural Network-enabled Motion Planner (Invited Paper),"Motion planning aims to find a collision-free trajectory from the start to goal configurations of a robot. As a key cognition task for all the autonomous machines, motion planning is fundamentally required in various real-world robotic applications, such as 2-D/3-D autonomous navigation of unmanned mobile and aerial vehicles and high degree-of-freedom (DoF) autonomous manipulation of industry/medical robot arms and graspers.Motion planning can be performed using either non-learning- based classical algorithms or learning-based neural approaches. Most recently, the powerful capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs) make neural planners become very attractive because of their superior planning performance over the classical methods. In particular, graph neural network (GNN)-enabled motion planner has demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance across a set of challenging high-dimensional planning tasks, motivating the efficient hardware acceleration to fully unleash its potential and promote its widespread deployment in practical applications.To that end, in this paper we perform preliminary study of the efficient accelerator design of the GNN-based neural planner, especially for the neural explorer as the key component of the entire planning pipeline. By performing in-depth analysis on the different design choices, we identify that the hybrid architecture, instead of the uniform sparse matrix multiplication (SpMM)-based solution that is popularly adopted in the existing GNN hardware, is more suitable for our target neural explorer. With a set of optimization on microarchitecture and dataflow, several design challenges incurred by using hybrid architecture, such as extensive memory access and imbalanced workload, can be efficiently mitigated. Evaluation results show that our proposed customized hardware architecture achieves order-of-magnitude performance improvement over the CPU/GPU-based implementation with respect to area and energy efficiency in various working environments."
,Towards LLM-augmented multiagent systems for agile software engineering,"A cognitive multi-agent ecosystem designed for efficient software engineering using Agile methodologies can significantly improve software development processes. Key components include the integration of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and Large Language Models (LLMs), utilizing Dynamic Context techniques for agent profiling, and Theory of Mind to enhance collaboration. The CogniSim Ecosystem analyzes problems, proposes solutions, constructs and validates plans, and coordinates specialized agents playing roles such as developers, executors, quality checkers, and methodology reviewers. These agents produce documentation, models, and diagrams (e.g., UML) while adhering to predefined quality and performance measures. The ecosystem also simulates the impact of various team configurations on problem-solving effectiveness, helping organizations identify optimal team structures. Case studies and simulations demonstrate its practical applications.CCS CONCEPTS• Computing methodologies → Multi-agent systems; • Software and its engineering → Agile software development."
,Modelling Experts’ Sampling Strategy to Balance Multiple Objectives During Scientific Explorations,"During scientific explorations, scientists often hold multiple, conflicting objectives. Understanding how scientists prioritize and balance these objectives is crucial for developing cognitively-compatible robotic teammates and fostering effective human-robot collaboration. In this study, we seek to improve the cognitive compatibility of robotic algorithms by modelling human’ decision making processes under multiple objectives. Collected human decision data from 141 sampling steps indicate that the majority of scientists adopt one of the following objective balancing strategies: (i) A Focus mode, where experts select sampling location to primarily optimize their primary objective; (ii) A Hierarchy mode, where experts hierarchically satisfy foremost their primary objective, then, to a lesser extent, their secondary objective; and (iii) A Trade-off mode, where experts select sampling locations to satisfy all objectives, even the location was not ideal for either objective. To understand how experts choose among the different modes, we quantitatively characterize the three types of strategies, by representing the decision data from each sampling step in an objective function space. Analysis of the strategy types reveals that, experts’ adaptation of multi-objective coordinating strategies are primarily governed by two key decision factors: current stages of sampling, and outstanding reward values. Based on this discovery, we developed a highly simplified decision algorithm that connects experts’ high-level objectives to desired sampling locations under multiple objectives. Deployment of this algorithm at a planetary-analogue field exploration mission on Mt. Hood demonstrates its potential in enabling robots to participate in the decision making process and suggest sampling plans that align well with scientists’ high-level goals.CCS CONCEPTS• Computing methodologies → Cognitive robotics."
,Improving Multi-Agent Path Finding via Multi Visual Model and Channel,"Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) aims to plan conflict-free joint optimal paths effectively for a group of agents from their respective starting points to destinations. This task is challenging due to its computational complexity. Current works focus on reducing the number of potential conflicts to further decrease the time required for path planning. In this study, we integrate deep learning-based architecture with the sub-dimension expansion method, aiming to transform the multi-agent pathfinding task into an image classification task. We employ visual models as single-agent path planner to predict optimal path based on the observation space of each agent, which reduces the number of conflicts and improves the performance of the planner significantly. The experimental results show that, in comparison to Learning-Assisted M*, our method achieves a reduction in potential conflicts and implements MAPF task effectively only with a minor increase in time consumption."
,Implementation of a ROS-based Digital Twin Approach of a Multi-Robot Cell for Incremental Manufacturing,"The rise of Industry 4.0 continues to revolutionise modern manufacturing through the integration of digital technologies and automation, opening up opportunities to improve efficiency, increase productivity and reduce costs. One of the key components of this transformation is the concept of digital twins, which allows for the creation of virtual replicas of physical systems, enabling real-time monitoring, control and optimisation through a virtual environment. In the field of industrial robotics, digital twins provide valuable insights into the behaviour and performance of robots, thereby facilitating the optimisation of robotic tasks and movements. With the increasing adoption of digitalisation and automation, digital twins have become an essential tool for manufacturing efficiency and effectiveness. The use of digital twins in robotic environments is therefore a key enabler of Industry 4.0, providing new opportunities to increase the manufacturing productivity through an increased planning and predictive accuracy and enhancing marketability in the global market. This research addresses the development and implementation of a digital twin within the Robot Operating System (ROS) environment for a hybrid multi-robot manufacturing system, providing a comprehensive overview of the required aspects of digitalisation for hybrid robot processes. Based on this setup, a digital twin approach for a multi-robot manufacturing cell is presented and discussed. With the overview and research generated within this publication, further optimisations of hybrid multi-robot cells regarding the interaction of movements and tasks as well as overarching process analysis and optimisation can be developed."
,A 2-stage optimisation approach to ensure security of supply in rural cellular energy structures with solid biomass-based (hybrid) systems,"The aspect of resilience and security of supply of the energy system is increasingly becoming the focus of societal interest. The decentralised use of solid biomass in combination with heat pumps and heat storage in hybrid systems could therefore play an important role. This can be particularly relevant in rural areas where the possibility of a district heating network is not available. Accordingly, it is even more crucial to manage this growing number of decentralised energy assets in order to avoid problematic grid conditions. Cellular energy systems are discussed as a method to organise the high com-plexity of numerous within itself complex systems in the grid from the bottom up. The modelling and mathematical optimisation of such cellular structured systems requires a detailed knowledge of the internal processes and thus a highly sophisticated implementation. A direct feedback between optimal operation and optimal planning is particularly important here, as the optima are interdependent. For this, the concept of a 2-stage optimisation approach of the local aspect is presented in this paper, which additionally considers the autonomous and subsidiary properties of the cellular approach within multi-agent systems. This leads to a value-optimised combination of the cellular approach and solid biomass-based (hybrid) systems with the goal of maximising the impact of the limited potential of biogenic residues."
,Machine learning approaches for offline-programming optimization in robotic painting,"Automatic robot programming is a major challenge to enable the cost-effective usage of robots for the production of small lot sizes and changing variants in painting applications. Offline-Programming (OLP) can be used to generate robot programs in a virtual environment and speed up the programming process with supportive functionalities. However, much human input is still needed to optimize robot programs for a specific painting task. The human operator uses his cognitive skills and experience based on process-specific rules to adapt the programming within the OLP system. The programming approach is an iterative process where the painting quality resulting from an initial robotic program is assessed in a laboratory, and then the program is adapted in the OLP system. It is difficult to model human decisions directly using closed-loop algorithmic approaches. Therefore, we propose five approaches based on machine learning to substitute human intervention throughout the programming process and allow for automatic and optimal robot program generation. The approaches are presented in this paper in a conceptual way showing potentials on the automation using machine-learning techniques. These approaches are: (1) similar program suggestion, (2) surface sequence generation, (3) process parameter optimization, (4) automatic setting of sample-based path planners parameters, and (5) path planning with a trained algorithm."
,DRAE: Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Expert Networks for Lifelong Learning and Task Adaptation in Robotics,"We introduce Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Expert Networks (DRAE), a groundbreaking architecture that addresses the challenges of lifelong learning, catastrophic forgetting, and task adaptation by combining the dynamic routing capabilities of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE); leveraging the knowledge-enhancement power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); incorporating a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) framework; and coordinating through ReflexNet-SchemaPlanner-HyperOptima (RSHO).DRAE dynamically routes expert models via a sparse MoE gating mechanism, enabling efficient resource allocation while leveraging external knowledge through parametric retrieval (P-RAG) to augment the learning process. We propose a new RL framework with ReflexNet for low-level task execution, SchemaPlanner for symbolic reasoning, and HyperOptima for long-term context modeling, ensuring continuous adaptation and memory retention. Experimental results show that DRAE significantly outperforms baseline approaches in long-term task retention and knowledge reuse, achieving an average task success rate of 82.5% across a set of dynamic robotic manipulation tasks, compared to 74.2% for traditional MoE models. Furthermore, DRAE maintains an extremely low forgetting rate, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in catastrophic forgetting mitigation. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling flexible, scalable, and efficient lifelong learning for robotics. © 2025 Association for Computational Linguistics."
,Bayesian Inverse Physics for Neuro-Symbolic Robot Learning,"Real-world robotic applications, from autonomous exploration to assistive technologies, require adaptive, interpretable, and data-efficient learning paradigms. While deep learning architectures and foundation models have driven significant advances in diverse robotic applications, they remain limited in their ability to operate efficiently and reliably in unknown and dynamic environments. In this position paper, we critically assess these limitations and introduce a conceptual framework for combining data-driven learning with deliberate, structured reasoning. Specifically, we propose leveraging differentiable physics for efficient world modeling, Bayesian inference for uncertainty-aware decision-making, and meta-learning for rapid adaptation to new tasks. By embedding physical symbolic reasoning within neural models, robots could generalize beyond their training data, reason about novel situations, and continuously expand their knowledge. We argue that such hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures are essential for the next generation of autonomous systems, and to this end, we provide a research roadmap to guide and accelerate their development. © 2025 O.

,JARVIS: A Neuro-Symbolic Commonsense Reasoning Framework for Conversational Embodied Agents,"Building a conversational embodied agent to execute real-life tasks has been a long-standing yet quite challenging research goal, as it requires effective human-agent communication, multi-modal understanding, long-range sequential decision making, etc. Traditional symbolic methods have scaling and generalization issues, while end-to-end deep learning models suffer from data scarcity and high task complexity, and are often hard to explain. Tobenefit from both worlds, we propose JARVIS, a neuro-symbolic commonsense reasoning framework for modular, generalizable, and interpretable conversational embodied agents. First, it acquires symbolic representations by prompting large language models (LLMs) for language understanding and sub-goal planning, and by constructing semantic maps from visual observations. Then the symbolic module reasons for sub-goal planning and action generation based on task- and action-level common sense. Extensive experiments on the TEACh dataset validate the efficacy and efficiency of our JARVIS framework, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on all three dialog-based embodied tasks, including Execution from Dialog History (EDH), Trajectory from Dialog (TfD), and Two-Agent Task Completion (TATC) (e.g., our method boosts the unseen Success Rate on EDH from6.1% to 15.8%). Moreover, we systematically analyze the essential factors that affect the task performance and also demonstrate the superiority of our method in few-shot settings. Our JARVIS model ranks first in the Alexa Prize SimBot Public Benchmark Challenge. © 2025 K. Zheng, K. Zhou, J. Gu, Y. Fan, J. Wang, Z. Di, X. He & X.E. Wang."
,Generalised BDI Planning,"Agent interpreters based on the Beliefs, Desires, and Intentions (BDI) model traditionally perform means-ends reasoning using plan libraries composed of reactive planning rules. However, the design of such rules often imposes a heavy knowledge engineering burden on a designer, and trades off flexibility for runtime efficiency. This use of planning rules originates from the limitations of planning technology at the time of the first BDI implementations. While these limitations have gradually been overcome by the integration of various types of planning into existing BDI theories, the corresponding interpreters remain fundamentally plan-library based. In this paper, we develop a novel BDI agent architecture driven by generalised planning as means-ends reasoning, in a radical departure from existing architectures. This architecture has two key properties. First, it more closely resembles the foundations of BDI logic and reasoning. Second, it offers substantial gains in efficiency in comparison with an architecture driven by classical planning. © 2025 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org)."
,Teaching Robots with Show and Tell: Using Foundation Models to Synthesize Robot Policies from Language and Visual Demonstrations,"We introduce a modular, neuro-symbolic framework for teaching robots new skills through language and visual demonstration. Our approach, SHOWTELL, composes a mixture of foundation models to synthesize robot manipulation programs that are easy to interpret and generalize across a wide range of tasks and environments. SHOWTELL is designed to handle complex demonstrations involving high level logic such as loops and conditionals while being intuitive and natural for end-users. We validate this approach through a series of real-world robot experiments, showing that SHOWTELL out-performs a state-of-the-art baseline based on GPT4-V, on a variety of tasks, and that it is able to generalize to unseen environments and within category objects.

,Learning to Ground Existentially Quantified Goals,"Goal instructions for autonomous AI agents cannot assume that objects have unique names. Instead, objects in goals must be referred to by providing suitable descriptions. However, this raises problems in both classical planning and generalized planning. The standard approach to handling existentially quantified goals in classical planning involves compiling them into a DNF formula that encodes all possible variable bindings and adding dummy actions to map each DNF term into the new, dummy goal. This preprocessing is exponential in the number of variables. In generalized planning, the problem is different: even if general policies can deal with any initial situation and goal, executing a general policy requires the goal to be grounded to define a value for the policy features. The problem of grounding goals, namely finding the objects to bind the goal variables, is subtle: it is a generalization of classical planning, which is a special case when there are no goal variables to bind, and constraint reasoning, which is a special case when there are no actions. In this work, we address the goal grounding problem with a novel supervised learning approach. A GNN architecture, trained to predict the cost of partially quantified goals over small domain instances is tested on larger instances involving more objects and different quantified goals. The proposed architecture is evaluated experimentally over several planning domains where generalization is tested along several dimensions including the number of goal variables and objects that can bind such variables. The scope of the approach is also discussed in light of the known relationship between GNNs and C2 logics. © 2024 Proceedings of the International Conference on Knowledge Representation and Reasoning.

,Communication with Individuals with Disabilities and the Role of LLMs: Progress Report,"This paper is part of a project aimed at leveraging neuro-symbolic architectures to achieve a sophisticated interaction between humanoid robots and individuals with cognitive impairments. In our architecture, a symbolic reasoning module based on Answer Set Programming creates a sequence of appropriate activities and monitors their execution in real-time. Large Language Models (LLMs) are used to enhance the user experience in various ways. Among those, in this paper we investigate methods for using LLMs to rewording text produced by the reasoning component, while keeping length and vocabulary level consistent with the original text. The study explores the effectiveness of metrics such as length and frequency of use, in comparing the vocabulary level of the input with that of the output. We present a comparative analysis of free or moderately priced LLMs, such as GPT-3.5, Google Gemini Pro, and Claude 3 Opus. A continuous validation process is also introduced, utilizing a critic that evaluates the appropriateness of the generated output at run-time. Although preliminary, the findings appear to indicate that while LLMs can often produce outputs with a vocabulary level comparable to the inputs, there are areas needing improvement, particularly in handling specific domain knowledge or less common phrases. This research contributes to the exploration of novel neuro-symbolic architectures and to the practical application of LLMs in contexts where controlled language use is essential for effective communication. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors."
,Hybrid Personal Medical Digital Assistant Agents,"Autonomous intelligent systems are beginning to impact clinical practice as personal medical assistant agents, by leveraging experts’ knowledge when needed and exploiting the vast amount of patient data available to clinicians. However, these approaches are seldom integrated. In this paper, we propose an integrated hybrid agent architecture that combines symbolic reasoning with sub-symbolic, data-driven models. Using the PIMA dataset, we demonstrate that this hybrid approach enhances the performance of both approaches when used alone. Specifically, we show that integrating a logical agent, which uses predefined expert knowledge plans, with rules obtained by symbolic knowledge extraction from machine learning models trained on historical data, improves system reliability and clinical decision-making, while reducing misclassified instances. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors."
,Fast and Slow Goal Recognition,"Goal recognition is a crucial aspect of understanding the intentions and objectives of agents by observing some of their actions. The most prominent approaches to goal recognition can be divided into two main categories: (1) trustworthy systems, which exploit automated reasoning for computing plans compatible with the observed actions, and (2) swifter systems, which try to quickly infer goals, often overlooking complex cognitive processes, and have no formal guarantees of their results. This paper introduces a novel approach inspired by the dual process theory, which integrates these two techniques. A dual-process model is proposed, leveraging fast, experience-based recognition for immediate goal identification, and slow, deliberate analysis for deeper understanding. Machine learning techniques and classical planning techniques are employed to obtain this dual-process system. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, reducing the amount of resources required to compute a solution (e.g., time to find a goal), while at the same time enhancing accuracy and robustness, especially in more complex scenarios. © 2024 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems."
,Towards building Autonomous AI Agents and Robots for Open World Environments,"The shift of AI agents from controlled laboratory environments to real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles and service robots, demands robust algorithms for navigating the intricacies of open-world scenarios. While traditional AI agents show proficiency in predictable, closed-world settings, their performance often diminishes in the dynamic and unforeseen conditions of real-world environments. My dissertation focuses on developing methods, frameworks, and domains that push the boundaries of open-world problem-solving in AI agents and robots. The central thesis question explores how AI agents can rapidly learn and adapt in open-world settings while tackling long-horizon, complex tasks. My work proposes integrative frameworks that combine reinforcement learning with symbolic planning, enabling on-the-fly adaptation of agents. Furthermore, we also propose environments designed for developing and assessing agent architectures adept at handling novelty. These advancements in open-world learning are pivotal in enhancing adaptability, speed, and robustness in AI agents and robots, laying a critical foundation for the development of resilient autonomous systems. © 2024 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems."
,LogiCity: Advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI with Abstract Urban Simulation,"Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) AI systems, which integrate symbolic reasoning into deep neural networks. However, most of the existing benchmarks for NeSy AI fail to provide long-horizon reasoning tasks with complex multi-agent interactions. Furthermore, they are usually constrained by fixed and simplistic logical rules over limited entities, making them far from real-world complexities. To address these crucial gaps, we introduce LogiCity, the first simulator based on customizable first-order logic (FOL) for an urban-like environment with multiple dynamic agents. LogiCity models diverse urban elements using semantic and spatial concepts, such as IsAmbulance(X) and IsClose(X, Y). These concepts are used to define FOL rules that govern the behavior of various agents. Since the concepts and rules are abstractions, they can be universally applied to cities with any agent compositions, facilitating the instantiation of diverse scenarios. Besides, a key feature of LogiCity is its support for user-configurable abstractions, enabling customizable simulation complexities for logical reasoning. To explore various aspects of NeSy AI, LogiCity introduces two tasks, one features long-horizon sequential decision-making, and the other focuses on one-step visual reasoning, varying in difficulty and agent behaviors. Our extensive evaluation reveals the advantage of NeSy frameworks in abstract reasoning. Moreover, we highlight the significant challenges of handling more complex abstractions in long-horizon multi-agent scenarios or under high-dimensional, imbalanced data. With its flexible design, various features, and newly raised challenges, we believe LogiCity represents a pivotal step forward in advancing the next generation of NeSy AI.

,GraphMP: Graph Neural Network-based Motion Planning with Efficient Graph Search,"Motion planning, which aims to find a high-quality collision-free path in the configuration space, is a fundamental task in robotic systems. Recently, learning-based motion planners, especially the graph neural network-powered, have shown promising planning performance. However, though the state-of-the-art GNN planner can efficiently extract and learn graph information, its inherent mechanism is not well suited for graph search process, hindering its further performance improvement. To address this challenge and fully unleash the potential of GNN in motion planning, this paper proposes GraphMP, a neural motion planner for both low and high-dimensional planning tasks. With the customized model architecture and training mechanism design, GraphMP can simultaneously perform efficient graph pattern extraction and graph search processing, leading to strong planning performance. Experiments on a variety of environments, ranging from 2D Maze to 14D dual KUKA robotic arm, show that our proposed GraphMP achieves significant improvement on path quality and planning speed over state-of-the-art learning-based and classical planners; while preserving competitive success rate. © 2023 Neural information processing systems foundation.

,Online Grounding of Symbolic Planning Domains in Unknown Environments,"If a robotic agent wants to exploit symbolic planning techniques to achieve some goal, it must be able to properly ground an abstract planning domain in the environment in which it operates. However, if the environment is initially unknown by the agent, the agent needs to explore it and discover the salient aspects of the environment necessary to reach its goals. Namely, the agent has to discover: (i) the objects present in the environment, (ii) the properties of these objects and their relations, and finally (iii) how abstract actions can be successfully executed. The paper proposes a framework that aims to accomplish the aforementioned perspective for an agent that perceives the environment partially and subjectively, through real value sensors (e.g., GPS, and on-board camera) and can operate in the environment through low level actuators (e.g., move forward of 20 cm). We evaluate the proposed architecture in photo-realistic simulated environments, where the sensors are RGB-D on-board camera, GPS and compass, and low level actions include movements, grasping/releasing objects, and manipulating objects. The agent is placed in an unknown environment and asked to find objects of a certain type, place an object on top of another, close or open an object of a certain type. We compare our approach with a state of the art method on object goal navigation based on reinforcement learning, showing better performances. © 19th International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, KR 2022.

,Epistemic Multiagent Reasoning with Collaborative Robots,"Over the last few years, the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and IoT have gained a lot of attention. This increasing interest has brought, among other things, to the development of autonomous multi-agent systems where robotic entities may interact with each other. As for all the other autonomous settings, also these systems require arbitration. Our work tries to address this problem by presenting a framework that embeds both a classical and a multi-agent epistemic (epistemic, for brevity) planner in a robotic control architecture. The idea is to combine the (i) classical and the (ii) epistemic solvers to model efficiently the interaction with: the (i) physical world and the (ii) information flows, respectively. In particular, the presented architecture starts by planning on the “epistemic level"" refining then single-agent world-altering actions thanks to the classical planner. To further optimize the solving process, we also introduce the concept of macros in epistemic planning. Macros, in fact, have been successfully employed in classical planning as they allow for opportune aggregations of actions that may lead to a reduction of plans' length. Finally, the overall framework is exemplified and validated with two Franka Emika manipulators. This allowed us to empirically justify how the combination of the two planning approaches (classical and epistemic), and the introduction of macros, reduce the computational time required by the orchestrating phase. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

,Dynamic action selection using image schema-based reasoning for robots,"Dealing with robotic actions in uncertain environments has been demonstrated to be hard. Many classic planning approaches to robotic action make the closed world assumption, rendering them inefficient for everyday household activities, as they function without generalizability to other contexts or the ability to deal with unexpected changes. In contrast, humans robustly execute underspecified instructions in unfamiliar environments. In this paper, we initiate our research program where we propose the use of functional relations in the form of image-schematic micro-theories, formally represented in ISLFOL, to enrich action descriptors with semantic components. It builds on the body of work in embodied cognition showing that human conceptualization of action sequences is founded on abstract patterns learned from physical experiences in the form of spatiotemporal relationships between object, agents and environments. These theories are used to inform action selection mechanisms for behavioral robotics written in EL++ and we argue how these micro-patterns can be applied in a more general way to deal with underspecified action commands and commonsense problem-solving. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

,A neural-symbolic approach for user mental modeling: A step towards building exchangeable identities,"Combining symbolic-reasoning and data learning in a unified double-loop learning system can contribute to the emergence of artificial intelligence solutions that are more adaptive to social and behavioural context. This paper presents a hybrid user modeling framework that relies on the integration of machine learning and reasoning methods equipped with formally represented domain knowledge. We find that this approach contributes to the design of context-aware systems that require less data, manage bias better, provide better transparency and can handle data sparsity more effectively. We present the impact of our work in different social domains from building trusted digital surrogates to decentralization of social recommendation services. Our approach can construct software agents from identity and expertise of users and allows such entities to become more digitally portable. Our approach also contributes to the emergence of expertise sharing paradigms that are less prone to biases and more privacy preserving. The paper uses these domain applications to validate the scalability and versatility of our approach augmented with principles of open and transparent algorithms. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

,Neuro-Symbolic Program Search for Autonomous Driving Decision Module Design,"As a promising topic in cognitive robotics, neuro-symbolic modeling integrates symbolic reasoning and neural representation altogether. However, previous neuro-symbolic models usually wire their structures and the connections manually, making the underlying parameters sub-optimal. In this work, we propose the Neuro-Symbolic Program Search (NSPS) to improve the autonomous driving system design. NSPS is a novel automated search method that synthesizes the Neuro-Symbolic Programs. It can produce robust and expressive Neuro-Symbolic Programs and automatically tune the hyper-parameters. We validate NSPS in the CARLA driving simulation environment. The resulting Neuro-Symbolic Decision Programs successfully handle multiple traffic scenarios. Compared with previous neural-network-based driving and rule-based methods, our neuro-symbolic driving pipeline achieves more stable and safer behaviors in complex driving scenarios while maintaining an interpretable symbolic decision-making process. © 2020 Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.

10.1002/rob.22374,Optimization-based motion planning for autonomous agricultural vehicles turning in constrained headlands,"Headland maneuvering is a crucial part of the field operations performed by autonomous agricultural vehicles (AAVs). While motion planning for headland turning in open fields has been extensively studied and integrated into commercial autoguidance systems, the existing methods primarily address scenarios with ample headland space and thus may not work in more constrained headland geometries. Commercial orchards often contain narrow and irregularly shaped headlands, which may include static obstacles, rendering the task of planning a smooth and collision-free turning trajectory difficult. To address this challenge, we propose an optimization-based motion planning algorithm for headland turning under geometrical constraints imposed by headland geometry and obstacles. Our method models the headland and the AAV using convex polytopes as geometric primitives, and calculates optimal and collision-free turning trajectories in two stages. In the first stage, a coarse path is generated using either a classical pattern-based turning method or a directional graph-guided hybrid A* algorithm, depending on the complexity of the headland geometry. The second stage refines this coarse path by feeding it into a numerical optimizer, which considers the vehicle's kinematic, control, and collision-avoidance constraints to produce a feasible and smooth trajectory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing it to the classical pattern-based method in various types of headlands. The results show that our optimization-based planner outperforms the classical planner in generating collision-free turning trajectories inside constrained headland spaces. Additionally, the trajectories generated by our planner respect the kinematic and control limits of the vehicle and, hence, are easier for a path-tracking controller to follow. In conclusion, our proposed approach successfully addresses complex motion planning problems in constrained headlands, making it a valuable contribution to the autonomous operation of AAVs, particularly in real-world orchard environments. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC."
10.1007/978-3-030-82017-6_9,Towards Explainable Visionary Agents: License to Dare and Imagine,"Since their appearance, computer programs have embodied discipline and structured approaches and methodologies. Yet, to this day, equipping machines with imaginative and creative capabilities remains one of the most challenging and fascinating goals we pursue. Intelligent software agents can behave intelligently in well-defined scenarios, relying on Machine Learning (ML), symbolic reasoning, and the ability of their developers for tailoring smart behaviors to specific application domains. However, to forecast the evolution of all possible scenarios is unfeasible. Thus, intelligent agents should autonomously/creatively adapt to the world’s mutability. This paper investigates the meaning of imagination in the context of cognitive agents. In particular, it addresses techniques and approaches to let agents autonomously imagine/simulate their course of action and generate explanations supporting it, and formalizes thematic challenges. Accordingly, we investigate research areas including: (i) reasoning and automatic theorem proving to synthesize novel knowledge via inference; (ii) automatic planning and simulation, used to speculate over alternative courses of action; (iii) machine learning and data mining, exploited to induce new knowledge from experience; and (iv) biochemical coordination, which keeps imagination dynamic by continuously reorganizing it. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
10.1007/978-3-031-19842-7_29,Learning Efficient Multi-agent Cooperative Visual Exploration,"We tackle the problem of cooperative visual exploration where multiple agents need to jointly explore unseen regions as fast as possible based on visual signals. Classical planning-based methods often suffer from expensive computation overhead at each step and a limited expressiveness of complex cooperation strategy. By contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a popular paradigm for tackling this challenge due to its modeling capability of arbitrarily complex strategies and minimal inference overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel RL-based multi-agent planning module, Multi-agent Spatial Planner (MSP). MSP leverages a transformer-based architecture, Spatial-TeamFormer, which effectively captures spatial relations and intra-agent interactions via hierarchical spatial self-attentions. In addition, we also implement a few multi-agent enhancements to process local information from each agent for an aligned spatial representation and more precise planning. Finally, we perform policy distillation to extract a meta policy to significantly improve the generalization capability of final policy. We call this overall solution, Multi-Agent Active Neural SLAM (MAANS). MAANS substantially outperforms classical planning-based baselines for the first time in a photo-realistic 3D simulator, Habitat.

10.1007/978-3-031-26412-2_4,Oracle-SAGE: Planning Ahead in Graph-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) commonly suffers from high sample complexity and poor generalisation, especially with high-dimensional (image-based) input. Where available (such as some robotic control domains), low dimensional vector inputs outperform their image based counterparts, but it is challenging to represent complex dynamic environments in this manner. Relational reinforcement learning instead represents the world as a set of objects and the relations between them; offering a flexible yet expressive view which provides structural inductive biases to aid learning. Recently relational RL methods have been extended with modern function approximation using graph neural networks (GNNs). However, inherent limitations in the processing model for GNNs result in decreased returns when important information is dispersed widely throughout the graph. We outline a hybrid learning and planning model which uses reinforcement learning to propose and select subgoals for a planning model to achieve.

These research directions allow robots to utilize their knowledge to simplify, understand, and efficiently plan their tasks. In this paper, we propose a semantic knowledge-based robot mission planning method in an irregular three-dimensional environment. We introduce an advanced robot mission planning method that defines the knowledge of robots and driving places based on ontology and utilizes the defined semantic knowledge. To this end, we define a robot domain based on Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and solve it through a classical planner to plan the mission. Finally, we validate the suitability of the proposed method by conducting experiments with real-world robots within the campus environment and comparing them with general PDDL-based methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

It contains three models, conceptualizing argumentation as balancing, argumentation as dialogue, and argumentation as inference respectively. Each model looks at argumentation from a different perspective, addressing its own concerns and using its own formal and computational methods. Whereas balancing is inspired by the scale metaphor and uses quantitative techniques typically found in theories in economics and neural computing, dialogue is developed in multiagent communication and interaction and uses chatbot and Large Language Models (LLMs) technology, and inference is derived from theoretical investigations in knowledge representation and reasoning and uses techniques from symbolic reasoning. By bringing together new and traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches, the A-BDI metamodel provides a formal and computational framework for human-level, neuro-symbolic, and hybrid AI. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025."
10.1007/s00354-024-00243-8,Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning for Multimodal Referring Expression Comprehension in HMI Systems,"Conventional Human–Machine Interaction (HMI) interfaces have predominantly relied on GUI and voice commands. However, natural human communication also consists of non-verbal communication, including hand gestures like pointing. Thus, recent works in HMI systems have tried to incorporate pointing gestures as an input, making significant progress in recognizing and integrating them with voice commands. However, existing approaches often treat these input modalities independently, limiting their capacity to handle complex multimodal instructions requiring intricate reasoning of language and gestures. On the other hand, multimodal tasks requiring complex reasoning are being challenged in the language and vision domain, but these typically do not include gestures like pointing. To bridge this gap, we explore one of the challenging multimodal tasks, called Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), within multimodal HMI systems incorporating pointing gestures. We present a virtual setup in which a robot shares an environment with a user and is tasked with identifying objects based on the user’s language and gestural instructions. Furthermore, to address this challenge, we propose a hybrid neuro-symbolic model combining deep learning’s versatility with symbolic reasoning’s interpretability. Our contributions include a challenging multimodal REC dataset for HMI systems, an interpretable neuro-symbolic model, and an assessment of its ability to generalize the reasoning to unseen environments, complemented by an in-depth qualitative analysis of the model’s inner workings. © The Author(s) 2024."
10.1007/s10846-021-01480-5,A Hybrid Planning Approach for Accompanying Information-gathering in Plan Execution Monitoring,"Autonomous robots that execute plans in real-world environments may easily get failed due to unexpected environment dynamics. For robust plan execution, a great number of plan execution monitoring works has been proposed to estimate plan execution effects and make recovery plans for any detected plan failures. However, most works have assumed the full observability of environment states and accessibility of complete information about environment dynamics, which shows limitations when executing plans under environment dynamics and partial observability. To efficiently and effectively monitor robot plans in dynamic and partially observable environments, this paper first proposes an accompanying action policy that specifies an interaction pattern between information-gathering plan and the task plan to estimate and monitor task plan execution. To provide a concrete implementation of the above pattern, we first identify the task achievement and execution monitoring as two separated goals in a robot task, and then propose a hybrid planning approach that integrates two planners to solve the goals. For a task-achievement goal, we utilize a classical planning framework ROSPlan to efficiently compute the global task plan. While executing each action of the plan, we cast the execution monitoring problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which plans the information-gathering plans for monitors the action execution effects and recover failures when necessary. We further implement a typical robotic service task to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. By comparing with both the baseline plan-invariant execution monitoring approach and a full POMDP planning approach, the hybrid planning approach is efficient in task planning and execution monitoring and effectively recovering plan failures in unknown environments. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
10.1007/s12369-024-01192-4,"A Hybrid Cognitive Architecture to Generate, Control, Plan, and Monitor Behaviors for Interactive Autonomous Robots","Interactive robots not only need to react in predefined or deterministic scenarios but also learn and adapt in real-time, mirroring cognitive flexibility akin to human intelligence. Achieving this autonomy entails developing cognitive architectures that integrate reactive, deliberative and emergent capabilities. Thus, this paper presents MERLIN2, a hybrid cognitive architecture to generate, control, plan, and monitor behaviors in autonomous robots. This architecture combines reactive, deliberative, and emergent components, aiming to enhance adaptability in dynamic environments and make intelligent real-time decisions, thereby improving autonomy and performance. MERLIN2 comprises a deliberative system, based on a knowledge base and a symbolic planner; and a behavioral system composed of reactive components and several emergent components. It addresses core cognitive aspects like action selection, perception, memory, learning, reasoning, and explainability. MERLIN2 is evaluated in a simulated world and in the real world Carry My Luggage task from the RoboCup@Home.

10.1007/s13748-025-00394-9,Synthesizing Evolving Symbolic Representations for Autonomous Systems,"This work presents a novel architecture for an open-ended learning system that integrates intrinsic motivation (IM) and classical planning to enable agents continuously learn and improve their knowledge over time in an unsupervised fashion. The main goal is to allow the agent to autonomously distill its experience into Probabilistic Planning Domain Definition Language (PPDDL) terms, thereby making causal relationships explicit and supporting automated planning. Starting with a virtually empty set of predefined tasks or goals, the agent harnesses intrinsic motivation to explore the environment autonomously, continuously using and enriching the high-level knowledge acquired through its experience in a virtuous cycle. Experimental evaluation in the Treasure Game domain demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach: starting with only a small set of primitive actions, we show how an agent can autonomously build and refine a high-level representation of the environment. Planning-based strategies grounded in this representation significantly outperform uninformed exploration by reaching intermediate sub-goals more efficiently and substantially reducing the time required to achieve the final objective. © The Author(s) 2025."
10.1016/j.artint.2022.103696,Analyzing generalized planning under nondeterminism,"In automated planning, there has been a recent interest in solving a class of problems, where a single solution applies for multiple, possibly infinitely many, instances. This necessitates a generalized notion of plans, such as plans with loops. However, the correctness of such plans is non-trivial to define, making it difficult to provide a clear specification of what we should be looking for. In an influential paper, Levesque proposed a formal specification for analyzing the correctness of such plans. He motivated a logical characterization within the situation calculus that included binary sensing actions. This characterization argued that from each state considered possible initially, the plan should terminate while satisfying the goal. Increasingly, classical plan structures are being applied to stochastic environments such as robotics applications. This raises the question as to what the specification for correctness should look like, since Levesque's account makes the assumption that actions are deterministic. In this work, we aim to generalize Levesque's account to handle actions with nondeterministic outcomes, which may also be accorded probabilities. By appealing to an extension of the situation calculus to handle probabilistic nondeterminism, we will show that Levesque's definition, as well as a notion of goal achievability proposed by Lin and Levesque, have limited appeal under stochastic nondeterminism. In essence, they correspond to one correct execution, which is unlikely to be adequate. Rather, we propose to delineate between goal satisfaction and termination leading to a range of correctness criteria. To better study these criteria, and to position the results in a broader context while still allowing for the generality of the situation calculus, we consider an abstract framework to study the correctness of plans with loops, in domains that are possibly unbounded, and/or stochastic, and/or continuous. Within that framework, we then prove numerous relationships between the criteria, including some impossibility results for categorically satisfying goals. Finally, we show that these notions provide a more granular view than those discussed in the literature, such as strong planning and strong cyclic planning. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
10.1016/j.artint.2024.104181,Planning with mental models – Balancing explanations and explicability,"Human-aware planning involves generating plans that are explicable, i.e. conform to user expectations, as well as providing explanations when such plans cannot be found. In this paper, we bring these two concepts together and show how an agent can achieve a trade-off between these two competing characteristics of a plan. To achieve this, we conceive a first-of-its-kind planner MEGA that can reason about the possibility of explaining a plan in the plan generation process itself. We will also explore how solutions to such problems can be expressed as “self-explaining plans” – and show how this representation allows us to leverage classical planning compilations of epistemic planning to reason about this trade-off at plan generation time without having to incur the computational burden of having to search in the space of differences between the agent model and the mental model of the human in the loop in order to come up with the optimal trade-off. We will illustrate these concepts in two well-known planning domains, as well as with a robot in a typical search and reconnaissance task. Human factor studies in the latter highlight the usefulness of the proposed approach. © 2024"
10.1016/j.is.2020.101639,A knowledge-intensive adaptive business process management framework,"Business process management has been the driving force of optimization and operational efficiency for companies until now, but the digitalization era we have been experiencing requires businesses to be agile and responsive as well. In order to be a part of this digital transformation, delivering new levels of automation-fueled agility through digitalization of BPM itself is required. However, the automation of BPM cannot be achieved by solely focusing on process space and classical planning techniques. It requires a holistic approach that also captures the social aspects of the business environment, such as corporate strategies, organization policies, negotiations, and cooperation. For this purpose, we combine BPM, knowledge-intensive systems and intelligent agent technologies, and yield one consolidated intelligent business process management framework, namely agileBPM, that governs the entire BPM life-cycle. Accordingly, agileBPM proposes a modeling methodology to semantically capture the business interests, enterprise environment and process space in accordance with the agent-oriented software engineering paradigm. The proposed agent-based process execution environment provides cognitive capabilities (such as goal-driven planning, norm compliance, knowledge-driven actions, and dynamic cooperation) on top of the developed business models to support knowledge workers’ multi-criteria decision making tasks. The context awareness and exception handling capabilities of the proposed approach have been presented with experimental studies. Through comparative evaluations, it is shown that agileBPM is the most comprehensive knowledge-intensive process management solution. © 2020"

Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative enabler of battery health management, offering capabilities beyond traditional models. This review provides a structured synthesis of recent progress in AI-enabled diagnostics. Advances in state estimation—including state of health (SOH) and remaining useful life (RUL)—are first examined, with methodological breakthroughs identified across diverse task formulations. The evolution of AI architectures is then traced, from conventional neural networks to attention-based Transformers, physics-informed models, and federated learning, with particular attention to emerging paradigms such as foundation models, neuro-symbolic reasoning, and quantum machine learning that promise improved robustness and interpretability.

10.1016/j.robot.2023.104415,A memory system of a robot cognitive architecture and its implementation in ArmarX,"Cognitive agents such as humans and robots perceive their environment through an abundance of sensors producing streams of data that need to be processed to generate intelligent behavior. A key question of cognition-enabled and AI-driven robotics is how to organize and manage such data and knowledge efficiently in a cognitive robot control architecture. We argue, that memory is a central active component of such architectures that mediates between semantic and sensorimotor representations, orchestrates the flow of data streams and events between different processes and provides the components of a cognitive architecture with data-driven services for learning semantics from sensorimotor data, the parametrization of symbolic plans for execution and prediction of action effects. Based on related work, and the experience gained in developing our ARMAR humanoid robot systems, we identified conceptual and technical requirements of a memory system as central component of cognitive robot control architecture that facilitate the realization of high-level cognitive abilities such as explaining, reasoning, prospection, simulation and augmentation. Conceptually, a memory should be active, support multi-modal data representations, associate knowledge, be introspective, and have an inherently episodic structure. Technically, the memory should support a distributed design, be access-efficient and capable of long-term data storage. We introduce the memory system for our cognitive robot control architecture and its implementation in the robot software framework ArmarX. We evaluate the efficiency of the memory system with respect to transfer speeds, compression, reproduction and prediction capabilities. © 2023"
10.1016/j.robot.2025.105167,Hybrid of representation learning and reinforcement learning for dynamic and complex robotic motion planning,"Motion planning is the soul of robot decision making. Classical planning algorithms like graph search and reaction-based algorithms face challenges in cases of dense and dynamic obstacles. Deep learning algorithms generate suboptimal one-step predictions that cause many collisions. Reinforcement learning algorithms generate optimal or near-optimal time-sequential predictions. However, they suffer from slow convergence, suboptimal converged results, and unstable training. This paper introduces a hybrid algorithm for robotic motion planning: long short-term memory (LSTM) and skip connection for attention-based discrete soft actor critic (LSA-DSAC). First, graph network (relational graph) and attention network (attention weight) interpret the environmental state for the learning of the discrete soft actor critic algorithm. The expressive power of attention network outperforms that of graph in our task by difference analysis of these two representation methods. However, attention based DSAC faces the problem of unstable training (vanishing gradient). Second, the skip connection method is integrated to attention based DSAC to mitigate unstable training and improve convergence speed. Third, LSTM is taken to replace the sum operator of attention weigh and eliminate unstable training by slightly sacrificing convergence speed at early-stage training. Experiments show that LSA-DSAC outperforms the state-of-the-art in training and most evaluations. Physical robots are also implemented and tested in the real world. © 2025 The Author(s)"

10.1049/icp.2025.0650,A supply-demand interaction optimization method based on blockchain and deep reinforcement learning,"With the proposal of the global carbon neutrality goal and the evolution of industrial park energy towards intelligence, traditional power dispatching and supply-demand management approaches have fallen short in meeting the demands for flexibility and precise regulation in modern industrial parks. This paper introduces an optimization method for supply-demand interaction, grounded in blockchain technology and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). By incorporating smart contracts and a multi-level virtual power plant (VPP) architecture, coordinated regulation of power resources and efficient peer-to-peer energy trading both within and beyond the park's confines are achieved. Specifically, the paper delineates the design of a blockchain-based distributed energy management system (DEMS) that integrates multi-agent DRL mechanisms, enhancing the adaptability and response speed of the industrial park. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method markedly outperforms traditional approaches in terms of flexibility, energy efficiency, and economic benefits, underscoring its extens ive application potential in the future energy management of intelligent industrial parks."
10.1049/icp.2025.2737,Adaptive MPC and nonlinear tracking control for non-holonomic robots in cluttered spaces,"This paper presents the implementation of trajectory planning and control for a non-holonomic robotic platform. Non-holonomic systems introduce significant challenges in motion planning and control due to their kinematic constraints. The proposed approach integrates graph-based path planning with trajectory optimization and employs both nonlinear control and model predictive control (MPC) for accurate trajectory tracking. The kinematic model of a unicycle-type robot is utilized, and two path planners Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM) and Hybrid A* are evaluated, with Hybrid A* selected for its ability to generate kinematically feasible paths. Trajectory optimization is formulated as a nonlinear optimal control problem, solved using direct single-shooting and multiple-shooting methods, with the latter proving more robust. A quadratic cost function penalizes state and input deviations while enforcing obstacle avoidance through geometric constraints. For trajectory tracking, a nonlinear feedback controller and an MPC-based approach are implemented and compared. Simulation results demonstrate that the nonlinear controller achieves precise tracking, while MPC exhibits robustness with slight oscillations in heading angle regulation. The study concludes that combining optimization-based trajectory planning with advanced control strategies ensures stable and efficient navigation for non-holonomic robots in constrained environments."
10.1049/icp.2025.3124,Cable path optimization and conflict detection of transmission lines based on multi-agent system,"With the continuous expansion of power grid scale and increasing complexity, rational planning of transmission line paths to avoid conflicts with topography, buildings and other facilities has become a key issue in power planning and design. In this paper, a hierarchical multi-agent system (MAS) architecture is proposed, which includes environmental awareness layer, agent decision-making layer and coordination and optimization layer, so as to realize intelligent planning of transmission line cable path. A distributed path optimization algorithm based on Multi-Agent Systems (MAS-DPOA) was further designed, incorporating the advantages of the Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). This approach achieves rapid path optimization through the collaborative search by agents and genetic operations. Meanwhile, a distributed conflict detection mechanism based on MAS (MAS-CDCM) was proposed, utilizing the local sensing capabilities and communication mechanisms of agents to detect and report conflicts in real-time. Through the case study analysis of a 220kV transmission line in a mountainous area in southwestern China, the results show that compared with traditional methods, the MAS-DPOA method can reduce path length by 12.5%, decrease tower base costs by 18%, and increase conflict detection accuracy to 96%. It significantly reduces the volume of engineering work and minimizes social impact, offering an efficient and accurate solution for transmission line route planning with promising application prospects."
10.1093/logcom/exad036,ECHO: A hierarchical combination of classical and multi-agent epistemic planning problems,"The continuous interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought, among other things, the development of several scenarios where multiple artificial entities interact with each other. As for all the other autonomous settings, these multi-agent systems require orchestration. This is, generally, achieved through techniques derived from the vast field of Automated Planning. Notably, arbitration in multi-agent domains is not only tasked with regulating how the agents act, but must also consider the interactions between the agents' information flows and must, therefore, reason on an epistemic level. This brings a substantial overhead that often diminishes the reasoning process's usability in real-world situations. To address this problem, we present ECHO, a hierarchical framework that embeds classical and multi-agent epistemic (epistemic, for brevity) planners in a single architecture. The idea is to combine (i) classical; and(ii) epistemic solvers to model efficiently the agents' interactions with the (i) 'physical world'; and(ii) information flows, respectively. In particular, the presented architecture starts by planning on the 'epistemic level', with a high level of abstraction, focusing only on the information flows. Then it refines the planning process, due to the classical planner, to fully characterize the interactions with the 'physical' world. To further optimize the solving process, we introduced the concept of macros in epistemic planning and enriched the 'classical' part of the domain with goal-networks. Finally, we evaluated our approach in an actual robotic environment showing that our architecture indeed reduces the overall computational time. © 2023 The Author(s).

The procedure of robot-assisted spine surgery is designed and described. An improved special 6-dof hybrid robot considering both the stiffness and workspace is proposed. And the kinematic model and jacobian matrix of robot are established. To realize fluroscopy images acquisition and avoid interfering with the patient during the process of positioning, human-robot cooperation based on fuzzy variable admittance control considering arm stiffness which would influence the stability of robot, is applied in robotic system. In addition, navigation techniques containing a novel bi-planar design, a robust circular control point detector and closed-loop positioning of tool, based on fluoroscopy images are proposed. In experiments, kinematic model of hybrid robot is test based on laser tracker and the distance error is 0.17 mm which is much smaller than the motion range. The effect of tool weight compensation is measured and the max mean force and torque errors are 0.7477N and 0.0617 N.M. The experimental results could meet requirements in human-robot cooperation. Furthermore, we test the the robotic system proposed in this paper on spine model bone and cadaver with the help of surgeons.

Within the context of autonomous navigation, path planning is relevant for comfortability, safety, execution time and energy savings. In this paper, we propose an approach to suggest smooth paths from observed robot trajectories by optimizing fitting and smoothness criteria using Differential Evolution with distinct modes of initialization, selection pressure, exploration and exploitation. Our rigorous computational experiments using a relevant set of real-world robot trajectories from the Boe-Bot mobile robot architecture show the feasibility and efficiency of our approach in computing smooth curves, suggesting the superior performance of the greedy initialization scheme based on the triangular convex hull of the robot trajectory, and Differential Evolution with exploitative and parameter adaptation schemes such as Rank-Based Differential Evolution (RBDE), Adaptive Differential Evolution with External Archive (JADE) and Strategy Adaptation Differential Evolution (SADE).

We want to find a method to predict the velocity and course of this robot, which can help us realize the accurate control of it. The paper proposed a promising type of hybrid robotic fish (HRF), which can realize two kinds of motion modes on the sea surface. Firstly, the configuration and dynamic model of the HRF were analyzed elaborately. Then, to realize accurate velocity prediction under two kinds of motion modes of HRF, the influence factors are presented in a complex marine environment. Based on the influence factors to its maneuverability, such as wind or wave parameters, a velocity prediction algorithm based on back-propagation neural network (BPNN) was introduced. However, BPNN has the disadvantages of extended learning and training time, easily falling into local optimum. Then we found that genetic algorithm (GA), which is a kind of evolutionary algorithm, is suitable for our problem. Therefore, the accuracy and efficiency of the prediction algorithm were improved by adopting the genetic algorithm to optimize the weight and threshold of BPNN. Taking the experimental data from the pool test, the back-propagation neural network with genetic algorithm (GA-BPNN) forecasting model was established. Besides, the other prediction methods were compared and evaluated under the same assessment criterion to validate the proposed forecasting model. The experimental results demonstrate that the GA-BPNN model has higher accuracy and efficiency compared with other prediction algorithms, which verifies the feasibility of the velocity prediction model for hybrid robotic fish in complex ocean environments."

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3017561,"STEP-NC Architectures for Industrial Robotic Machining: Review, Implementation and Validation","In the manufacturing sector, industrial robots are being increasingly improved to execute machining tasks as they exhibit significant advantages in terms of flexibility, cost-effectiveness, affordability, and larger work-space when compared to traditional computer numeric control (CNC) machines. However, programming this kind of equipment for robotic machining is complex, due to closed architecture controller and proprietary programming languages limitations. For that reason, this work aims at contributing to the adoption of the STEP-NC standard (STandard for the Exchange of Product model data- Numerical Control (ISO 10303-238 and ISO 14649)), generating programs for robotic machining operations. The STEP-NC data model enables the integration of information from design, process planning, simulation, manufacturing, and even inspection in a single platform, which could create new alternatives for industrial robotic machining programming. In this context, several previous studies are described in this manuscript aiming to highlight the contribution of this work, in addition to the analysis, implementation, and validation of six different STEP-NC architectures describing the advantages that each architecture provides for achieving robotic machining capabilities. Each introduced architecture can successfully generate a STEP-NC robotic machining program, either as ISO 10303-238 or ISO 14649, which are validated in a simulation environment with both a virtual robot model and a real industrial robot equipped with a LinuxCNC controller.

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3034524,Real-Time Object Navigation With Deep Neural Networks and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning,"In the last years, deep learning and reinforcement learning methods have significantly improved mobile robots in such fields as perception, navigation, and planning. But there are still gaps in applying these methods to real robots due to the low computational efficiency of recent neural network architectures and their poor adaptability to robotic experiments' realities. In this article, we consider an important task in mobile robotics - navigation to an object using an RGB-D camera. We develop a new neural network framework for robot control that is fast and resistant to possible noise in sensors and actuators. We propose an original integration of semantic segmentation, mapping, localization, and reinforcement learning methods to improve the effectiveness of exploring the environment, finding the desired object, and quickly navigating to it. We created a new HISNav dataset based on the Habitat virtual environment, which allowed us to use simulation experiments to pre-train the model and then upload it to a real robot. Our architecture is adapted to work in a real-time environment and fully implements modern trends in this area."

The search directions in these algorithms use the convex combination of the modified Barzilai and Borwein spectral parameters (IMA journal of numerical analysis, vol. 8, no. 1, pp. 141-148, 1988) and their geometric mean proposed by Dai et al. (In Numerical Analysis and Optimization, pp. 59-75, Springer, 2015). The incorporation of the inertial-step aids the proposed algorithms in producing more efficient results in comparison with three existing spectral algorithms. Under the assumption that the function under consideration is monotone and satisfies Lipschitz continuity, we prove the global convergence of the proposed algorithms. In addition, we also show the application of the proposed algorithms in motion control of two-joint planar robotic manipulator."
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3069744,"RT-TelSurg: Real Time Telesurgery Using SDN, Fog, and Cloud as Infrastructures","This paper proposes a novel and efficient real time network architecture, named RT-TelSurg, for one of the most appealing tactile Internet applications, i.e., Telesurgery. In telesurgery, the patient's vital signs and status and the required robotic commands during the surgery should be received on time. Otherwise, the life of the patient or the safety of the operation is endangered. Hence, transmitted packets should meet their respective relative deadlines. Software-defined networking is a relatively new architecture for computer and telecommunications networks in which the network control plane is separated from the data plane. One way to achieve real time telesurgery is to employ cloud and fog networks using SDN as infrastructure. By using a real time cloud controller in the SDN as the core and a fog controller on the edge of the network on the master (physician) side, one may satisfy the acceptable level of the timing constraints of the telesurgery. Accordingly, based on the presented architecture, we develop the statistical performance model of our proposed approach, RT-TelSurg. This statistical queuing theory model is designed for critical and non-critical states of the network. Based on these states, network resources are allocated to telesurgery data in both modes, and a computational bottleneck is detected. RT-TelSurg is evaluated according to real time and surgery efficiency parameters. The results show that the average deadline hit ratio is 98.2% in different conditions, which is quite acceptable for telesurgery applications."
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3095392,Speeding-Up Action Learning in a Social Robot With Dyna-Q+: A Bioinspired Probabilistic Model Approach,"Robotic systems that are developed for social and dynamic environments require adaptive mechanisms to successfully operate. Consequently, learning from rewards has provided meaningful results in applications involving human-robot interaction. In those cases where the robot's state space and the number of actions is extensive, dimensionality becomes intractable and this drastically slows down the learning process. This effect is specially notorious in one-step temporal difference methods because just one update is performed per robot-environment interaction. In this paper, we prove how the action-based learning of a social robot can be improved by combining classical temporal difference reinforcement learning methods, such as Q-learning or Q( λ), with a probabilistic model of the environment. This architecture, which we have called Dyna, allows the robot to simultaneously act and plan using the experience obtained during real human-robot interactions. Principally, Dyna improves classical algorithms in terms of convergence speed and stability, which strengthens the learning process. Hence, in this work we have embedded a Dyna architecture in our social robot, Mini, to endow it with the ability to autonomously maintain an optimal internal state while living in a dynamic environment."
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3139080,Multi-Robot Hybrid Coverage Path Planning for 3D Reconstruction of Large Structures,"Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is an essential capability for autonomous robots operating in various critical applications such as fire fighting, and inspection. Performing autonomous coverage using a single robot system consumes time and energy. In particular, 3D large structures might contain some complex and occluded areas that shall be scanned rapidly in certain application domains. In this paper, a new Hybrid Coverage Path Planning (HCPP) approach is proposed to explore and cover unknown 3D large structures using a decentralized multi-robot system. The HCPP approach combines a guided Next Best View (NBV) approach with a developed Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) waypoint prediction approach to decrease the CPP exploration time at each iteration and simultaneously achieve high coverage. The hybrid approach is the new ML paradigm which fosters intelligence by balancing between data efficiency and generality allowing the exchange of some CPP parts with a learned model. The HCPP uses a stateful LSTM network architecture which is trained based on collected paths that cover different 3D structures to predict the next viewpoint. This architecture captures the dynamic dependencies of adjacent viewpoints in the long term sequences like the coverage paths. The HCPP switches between these methods triggered by either the number of iterations or an entropy threshold. In the decentralized multi-robot system, the proposed HCPP is embedded in each robot where each one of them shares its global 3D map ensuring robustness. The results performed in a realistic Gazebo robotic simulator confirmed the advantage of the proposed HCPP approach by achieving high coverage on different 3D unknown structures in a shorter time compared to conventional NBV."
10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3173647,TeMoto: A Software Framework for Adaptive and Dependable Robotic Autonomy With Dynamic Resource Management,"For widespread deployment of robots in challenging environments (fire fighting, search and rescue, planetary exploration, etc.), the software of the robot must allow for reliability and adaptability. For many existing systems, an unexpected change in mission specification, component failures, or energy conservation requires downtime for adaption (redesign of mission logic, switching sensor data processing pipeline, etc.). This is because software and hardware components for robotic applications are commonly chosen or designed based on task requirements and integrated either directly in the source code or via system configuration scripts, such as ROS launch files, leading to a fixed monolithic design. As the necessity and extent of adaptive behaviors is not always known prior to deployment, the structure of a robot’s software needs to support it by design. In this paper, we propose TeMoto, a novel architecture for adaptive autonomous robots, and a ROS-based framework of openly available software tools that implement the TeMoto architecture. TeMoto is a developer tool which combines dynamic (run-time) task and resource management, encourages modular and scalable system design and is task and platform agnostic - TeMoto provides the foundation for an adaptive robotic system. The feasibility of the TeMoto framework is qualitatively assessed via experiments on single and multi-robot setups spanning common scenarios (teleoperation, autonomous surveillance, cargo delivery, etc.). TeMoto-based systems exhibit increased fault tolerance and dynamic reconfigurability of software and hardware resources, as well as up to a 47% reduction in power consumption compared to the non TeMoto-enabled reference setup."

This task is facilitated by unmanned vehicles, which improve data quality in hazardous areas and minimize human exposure. This work presents a novel methodology based on systems engineering concepts and hybrid control architecture for a catamaran-class unmanned surface vehicle (USV) named EDSON-J, for remote water quality monitoring activities with payload instrumentation. Critical aspects of the project development are considered, such as requirements, risk management, design flexibility, logical decomposition, functional classification, verification, integration and validation, and technological plan. The applied methodology proposes the main components for the vehicle, a main computer running robotic operating system (ROS) with deliberative control architecture for high-level tasks and a secondary computer running finite state machine (FSM) with hierarchical control architecture for low-level tasks, executing control and navigation algorithms. The results are given through missions of water quality monitoring, attaching a multiparameter payload sonde. Manual and automatic mode controls are suitable for circular and zig-zag maneuvers and show better performance for the proposed platform, guaranteeing the specifications and requirements of the vehicle design and validating the proposed hybrid control architecture."
10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3289964,Distributed Imaging Satellite Mission Planning Based on Multi-Agent,"As the core technology in the field of imaging satellite application, imaging satellite mission planning has received more and more attention. Aiming at this problem, this paper proposes a distributed imaging satellite mission planning method (DISMPA) based on multi-agent system. Firstly, a distributed imaging satellite mission planning model with variable collaborative division of labor is constructed based on multi-agent system theory. The model defines the intelligence level of satellites in the satellite cluster and the interaction mode between satellites. Secondly, the cooperation mechanism between satellite agents is established based on blackboard model. Two negotiation strategies of worker serial activation and worker parallel activation are proposed. In order to improve the efficiency of negotiation, the targets are preassigned before negotiation. Finally, a hybrid discrete multi-verse optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the mission planning problem of worker agents in the model. Simulation experiments show that the average fitness values obtained by DISMPM using serial activation strategy and DISMPM using parallel activation strategy are up to 20% higher than those obtained by the centralized algorithm with the best solution effect in this paper, and the average negotiation times of the two DISMPM methods are both reduced by more than 80% compared with the contract network algorithm, effectively reducing the system traffic and reducing the communication burden. It is proved that DISMPA is suitable for distributed imaging satellite mission planning."
10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3303841,MixNet: Physics Constrained Deep Neural Motion Prediction for Autonomous Racing,"Reliably predicting the motion of contestant vehicles surrounding an autonomous racecar is crucial for effective and performant ego-motion planning. Although highly expressive, deep neural networks are black-box models, making their usage challenging in this safety-critical applications of autonomous racing. On the other hand, physics-based models provide high safety guarantees for the predicted trajectory but lack accuracy. The method presented in this paper targets this trade-off. We introduce a method to predict the trajectories of opposing racecars with deep neural networks considering physical constraints to restrict the output and to improve its feasibility. We report the method’s performance against an LSTM-based encoder-decoder architecture on data acquired from multi-agent racing simulations. The proposed method outperforms the baseline model in prediction accuracy and robustness. Still, it fulfills quality guarantees of smoothness and consistency of the predicted trajectory and prevents out-of-track predictions. Thus, a robust real-world application of the model with high prediction accuracy is proven. The presented model was deployed on the racecar of the Technical University of Munich for the Indy Autonomous Challenge 2021. The code used in this research is available as open-source software at https://www.github.com/TUMFTM/MixNet."

This paper presents a novel hybrid framework that synergistically combines Task-Motion Planning and Dynamic Behavior Trees for ARSS in Minimally Invasive Surgery. Our approach is designed to address the challenges of coordinating multiple surgical tools within a small workspace, thereby making complex surgical tasks like multi-throw suturing feasible and efficient. Through an extensive evaluation in simulation across diverse initial conditions and noise scenarios, the proposed method demonstrates improved success rates, reduced execution times, and fewer regrasps compared to standalone approaches. Furthermore, it showcases robustness under increased noise conditions. By applying our framework to a complex multi-throw suturing task, we illustrate its capability to seamlessly handle comprehensive suturing tasks, including needle picking, insertion, extraction, and the handover of the needle between Patient Side Manipulators. The results suggest that our hybrid approach not only enhances ARSS autonomy but also adapts effectively to unexpected environmental changes, laying the groundwork for its potential applicability in real-world surgical robotics."
10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3321276,A Self-Supervised Learning Solution With Momentum-Based Siamese Network for Robotic Visual Task,"How a robot induces causality, abstracts information from states, and plans for tasks are major challenges in artificial intelligence. However, habitually used deep reinforcement learning is not a cure-all solution. This study proposes MoSN, a momentum-based Siamese network for a robotic visual task. Instead of trying to learn representations that abstract all the variation factors of the environment as in most prior studies, MoSN labels its observations as their causes so that it can learn representations of visual states in a self-supervised manner. These representations are then used to enhance perceptual and cognitive abilities and to perform our robotic visual task when a robot takes over a new environment. In particular, this study proposes a momentum-based Siamese network with augmentation methods and a hybrid explicit contrastive loss to improve the combinatorial generalization capability of our model. We validate MoSN in real-world environments equipped with lights and light switches and attempt to derive the cause-and-effect relationship between switch states and visual states. MoSN is compared with previous methods in both static and dynamic environments with both fixed and dynamic viewing angles. MoSN outperforms previous methods in most cases."

10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3330652,Multidrone Mission Execution With EAMOS: From Text to Mission,"Existing software tools for specifying and executing multidrone missions are limited to route planning or tightly coupled to specific drone hardware. We introduce EAMOS (Execution of Aerial Multidrone Missions and Operations Specification Framework), which allows us to specify missions intuitively, text-based, and provides a mission compiler, a mission middle layer, and a distributed drone execution environment. The middle layer wraps the control of individual drone-specific capabilities, such as launch, fly to position, or perform a maneuver, into a public API that transparently utilizes the capabilities of numerous drone platforms. We exploit the Go programming language to implement critical components of the framework and provide an interface for ROS-based drone platforms. EAMOS automates the mission execution on real, virtual, and even hybrid robotic setups involving real and virtual drones. We demonstrate the successful deployment of EAMOS with four missions executed on Pixhawk/PX4-equipped quadcopters and virtual drones simulated with Airsim. We assess the performance of our proposed approach by analyzing the number of nodes and arcs of the mission graphs, which are an essential artifact of our mission compilation, the utilization of ROS service calls during mission execution, and the duration of compilation, deployment, and mission execution. Overall, our experiments showed that our drones correctly behaved during mission execution as expected and specified by their mission, the generated mission artifacts were efficiently manageable, and processing times allowed for a fluent workflow."

Unlike conventional robot arms, which perform predefined tasks, intelligent robot arms have autonomy and can operate in changing environments, interact with other machines, and collaborate with humans. In this regard, adaptive path planning is crucial for intelligent robot arms, involving real-time environment monitoring and path generation to continuously update the robot’s trajectory based on changes in the surroundings. This paper presents an adaptive path planning method for intelligent robot arms to be used in dynamic environments. The proposed method is based on a hybrid active-passive approach and has been tested in a dynamic workspace simulation environment. The results indicate the ability of the proposed method to respond dynamically in a complex scenario where the target is fluctuating, and an obstacle is intentionally placed in the robot’s path. Additionally, real-time analysis results show that the method can be categorized as real-time path planning with less than 100 ms reaction time for grid sizes with less than  $96\times 96 \times 96$  cells. This insight presents opportunities for the establishment of smart factories, smart homes, and smart cities, where the presence of intelligent robot arms in dynamic environments becomes essential."
10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3351893,Deep Learning-Based Path Planning Under Co-Safe Temporal Logic Specifications,"This paper introduces an innovative deep learning framework for robotic path planning. This framework addresses two fundamental challenges: (1) integration of mission specifications defined through Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), and (2) enhancement of trajectory quality via cost function integration within the configuration space. The proposed method shows better efficacy compared to traditional sampling-based path planning methods in computational efficiency, due to its end-to-end neural network architecture. The framework functions in two key phases. Initially, using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), the proposed approach efficiently identifies and encodes optimal trajectory distributions. From these distributions, candidate control sequences are generated. Subsequently, a specialized neural network module selects and fine-tunes these sequences, ensuring compliance with the LTL specifications and achieving near-optimal solutions. Through rigorous simulation testing, we have validated the effectiveness of our method in producing low-cost trajectories that fulfill LTL mission requirements. Comparative analysis against existing deep learning-based path planning methods reveals our framework’s superior performance in both trajectory optimality and mission success rates."
10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3380004,Robot Motion Control Using Stepping Ahead Firefly Algorithm and Kinematic Equations,"The use of robots to carry out activities in various fields has evolved over the years. Robots can move from one location to another according to a plan and have a good understanding of the environment to perform their assigned tasks. Robot movements are based on motion planning and control algorithms. This paper proposes a new hybrid motion planning and control algorithm called FAStep-Kinematic (Stepping Ahead Firefly algorithm and Kinematic equations). This algorithm includes the Firefly Stepping Ahead algorithm to avoid obstacles, the equation of motion to control the movement of the robot, and a method to detect obstacles. The algorithm starts with the equation of motion and switches to the stepping ahead firefly algorithm when an obstacle is detected. The stepping ahead firefly algorithm then plans the robot’s next step to avoid obstacles. The robot moves to this step. This procedure is repeated until the robot successfully avoids an obstacle and reaches its target. The obstacles used in this article are static and are known to robots. The hybrid algorithm will be used to navigate robots in a cluttered environment. The new algorithm’s effectiveness will be seen with an application to tractor-trailer robotic systems. The results show that the robots are able to reach their destination safely and using a shorter route. Additionally, this research compared the new hybrid algorithm’s performance with that of the ACO-Kinematic (Ant Colony Optimization and Kinematic equations) algorithm in terms of path length and convergence time. The analysis show that the hybrid algorithm is superior to the ACO-Kinematic algorithm. The proposed algorithm improves the path length by 0.37%, 9.22%, and 5.79% compared to the ACO-Kinematic algorithm in three different scenarios."

It can be applied in the most varied business areas. Organizations from any sector of activity can also adopt it. Given these benefits, the granted success in transforming business processes would be expected. However, automation initiatives still fail. Adopting this technology can raise social, technological, ethical, methodical, and organizational issues. These facts have triggered the necessity for a summary that could extract more information about how to implement Business Process Automation (BPA), attending to the administrative processes, especially when applied in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). This study aims not only to review the available literature on how to implement BPA but also to typify the processes that can be automated, which technologies or tools exist for making that change, and influence factors in the procedure of BPA. We have covered more than 300 research papers published between 2016 and 2023 in reputable scientific data sources like Scopus, Web of Science/Clarivate, and ScienceDirect/Elsevier. The review revealed some paths for BPA, with some common steps. In addition, some common process characteristics fundamental to automation are exposed, as well as factors that are critical to an organization for successful automation. The results indicate that BPA is an established area in Business Process Management related to technologies/tools like Robotic Process Automation (RPA) or Cognitive-Robotic Process Automation (C-RPA), Workflow Management Systems (WfMS), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), and Blockchain.

10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3456914,ARCog-NET: An Aerial Robot Cognitive Network Architecture for Swarm Applications Development,"This work presents an advanced cognitive architecture for networked aerial robots to implement autonomous swarm systems effectively. It focuses on designing, implementing, and evaluating an architecture that enables unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to coordinate and cooperate for complex tasks, with or without human intervention. Inspired by artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and robotics, the architecture integrates perception, planning, decision-making, and adaptive learning to optimize swarm behavior in dynamic environments. The architecture uses a distributed processing model based on the “edge-fog-cloud” (EFC) concept. Edge-level robots handle real-time data collection, local decision-making, and environmental perception. Fog-level vehicles manage intermediate processing and supervision of the groups, while cloud servers perform comprehensive data analysis and long-term storage, being the higher-level hierarchy of the framework. This structure allows efficient distribution of computational tasks, with critical decisions made at the robot level and complex analysis done in the fog or cloud. The implementation of ARCog-NET involves deploying a multi-agent simulation system using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Gazebo simulator, facilitating the integration of sensors, communication protocols, and data processing algorithms. The performance evaluation demonstrates the architecture’s effectiveness in a wind farm inspection scenario, where the UAV swarm exhibits improved trajectory planning, collision avoidance, and data processing efficiency. Simulation results show that ARCog-NET reduces latency, increases data throughput, and enhances operational effectiveness, providing a robust platform for future developers to focus on applications and direct robot control methods."

This paper presents a novel hybrid robot with three translational and three rotational movements. A systematic mechanical design methodology on the basis of the screw theory is proposed to comprehensively search for feasible five-degrees-of-freedom parallel structures. The usage of only planar kinematic joints is beneficial to large translation/rotation reachable workspaces. A parallel robot is chosen to construct a six-degrees-of-freedom hybrid structure. Both the position and velocity relations between the actuators and the mobile platform are established for the parallel unit. Sloping linkages in the curved shape instead of the straight shape are employed to improve the range of motion of the corresponding rotary joints. Both the translation/rotation workspaces are investigated and the manipulability measure is explored. The novel mean manipulator velocity ratio index is developed and examined on this parallel robot.

10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3473792,Collaborative Autonomous Navigation of Quadrotors in Unknown Outdoor Environments: An Active Visual SLAM Approach,"The development of an integrated path-planning and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (ASLAM) system, specifically designed for the autonomous and real-time guidance of quadrotors navigating through unexplored outdoor environments helps to map the generation of unknown natural resources. To achieve this goal, a path-planning methodology that leverages system observability is exploited for a quadrotor. This path-planning method is underpinned by the eigenvalues of the Gramian matrix, which are used as a measure of system observability degree, to increase the precision of the quadrotor’s estimated position. In SLAM, high accuracy in the quadrotor’s state estimation improves the accuracy of the map landmarks position estimation. To enhance the accuracy and fortify system robustness, implementing a centralized distributed architecture within a group of three quadrotors is advocated. In this setup, the role of a central hub for information fusion from all agents and determining the most observable path for the entire group is assigned to the leader quadrotor. An assessment of the proposed path-planning method against a random path-planning approach within a single-agent architecture is conducted across various scenarios. This evaluation compares the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the quadrotor’s state estimation. The results illustrate a notable improvement in accuracy. Furthermore, a comparison is conducted to assess the performance of the multi-agent architecture in contrast to the single-agent architecture using the proposed method. The simulation and experimental results confirm a better accuracy in all scenarios and highlight the increased robustness of the cooperative architecture, particularly in fault scenarios, compared to a single-agent architecture."
10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3481426,Flexit: Flexible Location Encoding for Item Access in Medication Management Systems,"In hospitals and pharmacies, the demand for efficient medication management (e.g., item storage and access) is rapidly increasing, and the scale of medication management systems is gradually expanding. Intelligent medication management systems based on Internet of Things (IoT) can enhance the system efficiency and largely save labor costs through contactless medication dispensing and robotic item access. A typical medication management system that can store medicines usually includes several cabinets, each cabinet contains several drawers, and each drawer contains medicine boxes. In this paper, we propose, Flexit, a framework of flexible location encoding schemes that can encode the locations of cabinets, drawers, and boxes for efficient item access in an intelligent medication management system. Flexit includes a human/user interface, a central control unit, and a medication storage system, built upon medicine cabinets. Given storage space constraints, we propose a hybrid data compression method that combines trees and bitmaps, which is further optimized according to Huffman coding principles. Additionally, given a location code, the user/robot is capable to decode a number of locations, and Flexit employs a location-aware path planning algorithm to help access the stored items at these decoded locations at the minimal time-distance combined cost. We evaluate the performance of the data compression and path-planning algorithms through experiments over datasets, which show superior performance compared to existing methods, i.e., the compression algorithm can save 5-10 times the storage space on average, and the path-planning algorithm can reduce the system’s runtime by 20-50%."
10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3562078,Ultrasound-Based Visual Servoing for Out-of-Plane Longitudinal Needle Tracking in Robot-Aided Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy,"Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is a minimally invasive procedure to remove large renal calculi through a small incision in the patient’s back. Ultrasound (US) imaging is commonly used to guide the needle to the kidney during this procedure. However, it requires an advanced level of dexterity to coordinate the US probe and the needle to keep the needle visible in the images at all times. Failure to maintain needle-probe alignment can result in inadvertent injury, bleeding, and other complications. The use of robotic assistance can alleviate the surgeon’s cognitive workload by enabling autonomous positioning of the US probe and accurate needle tracking. This paper presents a new US-guided visual servoing (VS) algorithm for needle tracking using longitudinal US images of a needle subjected to out-of-plane motion. The ultrasound probe can move in 4 degrees-of-freedom (DOF), that is, two translations and one rotation in the imaging plane, and one rotation out of the imaging plane. Unlike previously reported VS algorithms, 4-DOF tracking is achieved using only 2D-US images and without any additional position sensor or prior knowledge of the needle trajectory. The algorithm is validated extensively in three different experimental scenarios using a water tank, a tissue phantom, and ex-vivo porcine tissue. Results obtained from several trials confirm the algorithm’s ability to track the needle and maintain needle-probe alignment with an average error of 1.5 mm, despite an out-of-plane average needle deflection of 7 mm along a 60 mm insertion depth."

The cloud radio access network (C-RAN) is a promising mobile network architecture that can meet the ever-increasing resource demand of a growing number of users. In C-RAN, base station functionalities are separated into baseband units (BBUs) and remote radio heads (RRHs), with BBUs centralized and virtualized via cloud computing. However, this architecture introduces new challenges in efficiently allocating resources to dynamic users. This paper aims to design a resource allocation scheme that improves system efficiency and satisfies dynamic user demands in C-RAN. We propose a hybrid resource allocation approach that combines centralized control and multi-agent-based decision-making. The centralized controller, located within the BBU pool, collaborates with virtual base stations (VBSs) acting as multi-agent system (MAS) agents. The resource allocation solution is derived by jointly considering the real-time resource requests from agents and the historical demand estimates generated by the centralized controller. Through simulation-based evaluation, we compare our proposed scheme with conventional random and fixed resource allocation methods. The results demonstrate improved performance in terms of resource utilization, reduced unfulfilled demand, and fairness among VBS agents. The proposed combined resource allocation strategy effectively meets dynamic user requirements while maintaining system efficiency in C-RAN. Our work highlights the importance of integrating historical demand trends with real-time agent requests for improved long-term resource planning."
10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3580222,Neural-Augmented Hybrid Dynamic Modeling of a Series-Parallel Elastic Actuator,"This paper proposes a neural network-based model of a novel hybrid Series-Parallel Elastic Actuator (SEA-PEA) architecture for high-performance robotic applications. The system combines a Brushless DC (BLDC) motor, a planetary gearbox, and a rotary pneumatic actuator serving as an elastic element. While the gearbox offers advantages such as low cost and back-drivability, it suffers from significant backlash due to manufacturing tolerances. To address this, the actuator connects the gearbox output shaft directly to that of the pneumatic actuator. For a parallel configuration, both stators are mounted on an aluminum holder supporting the entire assembly. Within the backlash region, the system behaves as a Series Elastic Actuator (SEA), with the pneumatic actuator’s elasticity influencing stiffness, damping, and inertia. Outside this region, the system transitions to a Parallel Elastic Actuator (PEA), rigidly coupling the motor and gearbox shafts. A hybrid modeling approach is introduced to capture the actuator’s dynamic response. The SEA behavior is modeled using a closed box Artificial Neural Network (ANN), specifically an Echo State Network (ESN), which showed the lowest mean squared error (MSE) among the tested architectures. The PEA behavior is modeled using a gray-box approach, combining a linear dynamic block with a nonlinear static block represented by an ANN (Wiener model). This hybrid framework, integrating an ESN, achieved lower prediction error and better performance than other ANN architectures, as confirmed by experimental results."
10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3583469,Knowledge-Based Planning for Human-Robot Collaborative Tasks,"Human-robot collaboration is a promising alternative to full automation and manual labour. Collaborative robots are considered safe and individual robot actions can often be easily programmed, for example, by physical hand-guiding. Coordinated collaboration, where tasks and the environment are shared, cannot be so easily achieved, due to continuously changing conditions and actions that need to be triggered at unknown instances. Besides, knowledge required for collaboration is difficult to program into robotic systems. This paper presents a system architecture that aims at facilitating human-robot collaboration by alleviating the need for pre-programmed information and exploring ways to teach new skills. This is done by reducing the amount of information required to program tasks by utilizing a knowledge base that represents knowledge on tasks, actions and the world. Automatic reasoning over conditions and properties of the knowledge is then utilized to generate available actions and action plans in order to complete the shared tasks. Moreover, learning new tasks is enabled by extending the original knowledge base, concatenating available actions and tasks into news bricks of knowledge. Two examples, a kitting task and a handover task, serve to validate the system architecture and exemplify its usage. Experiments demonstrate that by combining reasoning methods and knowledge-based planning, high-level shared tasks can be generated and executed, and robots can act reliable as teammate to human operators."
10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3585989,New Energy and CCUS Thermal Power Synergistic Peaking Cost Model and Apportionment Optimization Strategy,"Driven by the global carbon neutral strategy, the large-scale application of Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) technology has significantly weakened the peaking margin of thermal power units, and the traditional peaking cost allocation model fails to take into account the inequitable distribution of costs faced by the carbon capture power plants participating in peaking. This study proposes a peaking cost quantification method based on multidimensional characterization. In terms of temporal characteristics, the scenario substitution method is used to quantify the participation of different peaking entities in peaking; in terms of spatial characteristics, the initiative constraints of unit peaking are taken into account to ensure that each peaking entity actively participates in peaking and profits from it. Considering the impact of carbon capture power plants’ participation in peak shifting on carbon emission reduction and carbon cost, we constructed a dynamic peak shifting model for multiple subjects. We innovatively construct a two-layer architecture of “spatio-temporal two-dimensional quantization and dynamic game sharing”, and adopt the improved kernel method to establish a coalition reorganization trigger mechanism to solve the unfair sharing of peaking costs when carbon capture power plants participate in peaking. Taking the improved IEEE34 node as an example, the results show that the established cost calculation model can accurately calculate the peak shaving cost of each unit in different scenarios. The total cost of thermal power peak shaving using CCUS is 6.5% lower than that of conventional thermal power units, which significantly verifies the effectiveness of CCUS technology in reducing the economic burden of peak shaving. When the carbon price is 150-250 yuan/ton, the carbon emission is reduced by 40%-50%, which highlights the dual advantages of the model in deep emission reduction and carbon price co-optimization, and the cost increase is  $\le 5$ %, which proves the feasibility of achieving large-scale carbon emission reduction under the premise of strictly controlling the economic cost. On the basis of completing energy conservation and emission reduction, the peak regulation task is completed at the minimum cost, and the unity of economy and environmental protection is achieved. Compared with the Shapley value method, the correlation coefficient of the contribution of the kernel method is increased to 0.91, which indicates that the accuracy of the proposed method for the evaluation of multi-agent contribution is significantly improved, and the fairness of the peak-shifting cost-sharing model of the kernel method is significantly improved, which provides a reliable solution for solving the problem of cost allocation imbalance between traditional power supply and CCUS units."
10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3598864,A Digital Twin-Empowered Framework for Interactive Consumers in Manufacturing Using Wearable Device,"In the cyber-physical world, human-robot interaction (HRI) plays an increasingly important role in digital twin (DT)-enabled development, particularly in smart manufacturing. This investigation introduces a novel DT-based robotic framework for HRI (DTbRF-HRI), aiming to further productivity, automation, and safety. Our framework includes major elements such as real-time data communication, a common digital model, and a simulation environment for obstacle avoidance and autonomous manipulation. One contribution of our works is the application of an enhanced A-star algorithm for motion planning to support fast generation of paths and avoiding collisions. The data exchange between the physical and virtual agent is supported through system architecture and communication protocols, which meet with being very fast. The resulting framework is validated using numerical simulation and physical experiments in a common electronic consumer manufacturing scenario. Findings demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and practicability of DTbRF-HRI in improving intelligent robotic process in a cyber-physical system."
10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3602286,NM-TD3: A Hybrid Noise-Driven TD3 Algorithm With Long-Term Reward Propagation for Mobile Robot Path Planning,"Path planning is one of the core technologies enabling intelligent decision-making in autonomous navigation for mobile robots. However, existing reinforcement learning methods still face multiple challenges in complex environments, such as sparse rewards, insufficient exploration, slow convergence, and limited generalization capabilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes an improved version of the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm. The algorithm incorporates an n-step return mechanism to enhance the modeling of long-term dependencies, and introduces a dynamic hybrid exploration strategy that combines Gaussian noise with Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) noise to improve exploration stability and training efficiency. In addition, a shaped reward function is constructed by integrating several key factors, including distance to the target, heading alignment, obstacle avoidance, and time efficiency, to provide continuous feedback during the learning process. The proposed method is validated on the Gazebo simulation platform. Experimental simulation results show that, compared to the original algorithm, the improved version increases the success rate by 37% in complex static environments and by 28% in dynamic obstacle scenarios. The approach significantly accelerates training convergence and enhances policy generalization, effectively demonstrating its practicality for robotic path planning tasks."
10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3603738,An Adaptive Human–Robot Interaction Framework Using Real-Time Emotion Recognition and Context-Aware Task Planning,"Existing approaches often operate poorly in noisy or occluded conditions, rely on cloud-based inference subject to latency and privacy issues, and do not take emotional context into consideration while planning for a task. This research introduces the Emotion–Context Reinforced Planner, a novel human–robot interaction framework designed to deliver emotionally and contextually adaptive behaviors in real-time. The objective is to enhance social coherence and responsiveness while enabling intelligent action sequencing on low-power robotic platforms. The framework utilizes a multimodal emotion recognition system that relies on a confidence-weighted estimate of how facial and vocal features should be fused, a context encoder, and a reinforcement learning policy based on a Double Deep Q-Network. The framework’s architecture was engineered to be readily deployed on low-power embedded systems (Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi 4) and evaluated via TensorRT quantization and kernel fusion. Experimental evaluations reveal a 92.1% F1-score in emotion classification, 94.2% task-switching accuracy, and 34.8 ms response latency outperforming state-of-the-art models including CLEF and Pepper-based multimodal planners. Performance in real-time was achieved with up to 30 FPS on edge devices. A user satisfaction rating of 4.4/5 indicates strong perceived coherence and empathy in social interaction scenarios. ECRP offers a robust, scalable, and socially coherent solution for real-time human–robot interaction, outperforming existing methods both in accuracy and latency. Its fusion of emotional understanding and adaptive task planning significantly improves human engagement, making it suitable for use in elderly care, education, and customer service domains."
10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3609454,HADP: Hybrid A*-Diffusion Planner for Robust Navigation in Dynamic Obstacle Environments,"Autonomous driving in dynamic environments requires the ability to rapidly perceive changes and make safe, efficient decisions. While numerous studies have explored learning-based planning methods to address this challenge, diffusion-based planning methods have recently emerged as a promising approach in robotic path planning by modeling action sequences as probabilistic trajectories and capturing diverse planning behaviors under uncertainty. However, they still face significant challenges in generalizing to unseen situations and demand extensive data collection to achieve robust performance. In particular, efforts to ensure general robustness by learning from all possible scenarios can introduce inefficiencies, as many cases may be irrelevant during actual deployment. To address these challenges, this study proposes the Hybrid A*-Diffusion Planner (HADP), designed to achieve robust navigation performance even in unseen dynamic environments. In obstacle-free environments, HADP employs the A* algorithm for global path planning, whereas when a dynamic obstacle is detected within a predefined boundary, it records observations and leverages a conditional diffusion model to generate a local avoidance path. After avoidance, the path is re-planned using A*. To enable the diffusion model to generate effective avoidance paths, a semantic map is constructed by incorporating key environmental information within the predefined boundary. This map, along with the robot’s position and local goal information, serves as a conditional input to the diffusion model. HADP is trained on an expert trajectory dataset created by recording expert-driven navigation across various dynamic obstacle avoidance scenarios. Experiments in various simulations in dynamic obstacle environments demonstrated HADP’s superior success rate, trajectory smoothness, and robust generalization performance in unseen environments compared to existing approaches. Real-world tests further confirmed its practical applicability and highlighted its potential as a robust and scalable solution for dynamic obstacle environments, and the simulation code used in this study is publicly available at https://github.com/DSLab-MJU/HADP"
10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3610890,UnifiedKP: A Unified Network Knowledge Plane for Large Model-Enabled 6G Networks,"The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and agentic systems is revolutionizing the landscape of 6G networks by enabling unprecedented levels of autonomous intelligence, including self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-healing capabilities. However, current implementations face significant challenges. Individual intelligence tasks require isolated knowledge retrieval pipelines. This isolation results in redundant data flows, inconsistent interpretations, and increased operational complexity. Inspired by the service model unification efforts in Open-RAN that promote interoperability and vendor diversity, we propose UnifiedKP: a unified Network Knowledge Plane specifically designed for large model-enabled autonomous 6G network intelligence. By decoupling network knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence logic, UnifiedKP streamlines development workflows and significantly reduces maintenance complexity for intelligence engineers. Through an intuitive and consistent knowledge interface, UnifiedKP enhances interoperability for network intelligence agents while maintaining semantic consistency across diverse intelligence tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of UnifiedKP through two representative intelligence applications: live network knowledge question-answering and edge AI service orchestration. Experimental results show that UnifiedKP reduces knowledge retrieval latency by 47%, improves knowledge consistency by 82%, and decreases development complexity by 65% compared to traditional isolated approaches. Our framework achieves 94.3% accuracy in network anomaly detection and reduces service orchestration time by 38% in dynamic edge computing environments. These findings establish UnifiedKP as a foundational architecture for realizing truly autonomous and intelligent 6G networks."
10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3612015,Agentic Reasoning for Social Event Extrapolation: Integrating Knowledge Graphs and Language Models,"Accurate prediction of socio-political events is a longstanding challenge with profound implications for risk management, policy planning, and international relations. Traditional machine learning approaches, such as graph neural networks and recurrent neural networks, have achieved notable progress but often struggle to integrate rich textual context and provide interpretable reasoning. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities across diverse tasks, including text generation, code synthesis, and complex multimodal reasoning, making them promising candidates for event prediction in dynamic, data-rich environments. This research presents an agentic reasoning framework combining temporal knowledge graphs, large language models (LLMs), and a modular tool-based architecture to address event extrapolation in complex, real-world settings. The methodology integrates agent-based reasoning, iterative tool invocation, and explicit validation mechanisms to ensure logical consistency and transparency in predictions. Experiments on country-specific subsets of the POLECAT dataset employ multiple LLM architectures and multiple evaluation metrics, including Hit@k, MRR, F1-scores and Prediction Entropy. Comparative analyses demonstrate that the agentic framework achieves robust predictive performance and interpretability, complementing fine-tuned LLM baselines. Furthermore, the ethical implications of deploying AI in social computing are addressed, including bias, transparency, and accountability. This study advances event prediction by demonstrating how agentic LLMs, equipped with explicit reasoning and validation, provide scalable and ethically grounded solutions for complex social event extrapolation."
10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3625601,Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes in Shared Autonomy Applications: A Survey,"Shared autonomy consists of a collaborative effort between a human user and a robotic system having a shared goal, in which the human-controlled robot adapts its behaviour to provide assistive actions. For effective assistance, shared autonomy systems are required to infer human goals and/or cognitive states from their inputs. Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) offer a rich mathematical framework for formulating the above-mentioned planning problems under uncertainty. This paper presents a systematic review on the reported applications of POMDPs in the shared-autonomy context. Various aspects of the current scientific literature have been analysed to determine common shared-autonomy scenarios, implementation of human parameters in POMDPs and assessment methodologies. The effectiveness and limitations of POMDP approach for shared autonomy systems are also discussed."
10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3630344,Cognitive Architectures in Autonomous Robotics: A Systematic Review of Behavior Generation Approaches and Evaluation Strategies,"Cognitive architectures are an essential component in the development of intelligent autonomous robots, enabling planning, learning, and adaptation to dynamic environments. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature focused on cognitive architectures applied to behavior generation in autonomous robotics. A structured search and selection process was conducted using multiple scientific databases, applying explicit inclusion, exclusion, and quality assessment criteria. From an initial set of 502 studies, 22 publications (2018–mid-2025) were selected for in-depth analysis. The review identifies a growing trend toward hybrid architectures that integrate symbolic reasoning with data-driven methods, such as neural networks and behavior trees. The types of architectures, tools used (such as symbolic planners, neural networks, and behavior trees), middleware employed (with a predominance of Robot Operating System), as well as the methods and metrics used in their evaluation, are analyzed. This review provides a detailed overview of the state of the art and highlights the technologies and approaches currently most widely used in the design of cognitive robotic systems."
10.1109/ACCTCS66275.2025.00010,The Research on Robotic Arm Motion Planning Based on Deep Learning and Hybrid Path Planning,"This paper proposes a robotic arm motion planning method based on deep learning and hybrid path planning. Environmental point cloud data is obtained using a Realsense depth camera, and the GSNet network is employed to extract global environmental features, generating key information for path planning. The motion planning module utilizes LSTM and MDN networks to predict the next motion pose of the robotic arm, generating a Gaussian mixture distribution for the next joint state. The specific next joint state is determined through Gaussian sampling. A collision detection module is integrated into the path planning process to validate the feasibility of the generated joint states. If collision detection fails beyond a certain threshold, a strategy combining the Artificial Potential Field (APF) method and the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm is employed. This approach overcomes local minima issues and achieves local obstacle avoidance, ensuring the feasibility and smoothness of the path. Experimental results demonstrate that this method effectively integrates the advantages of deep learning and traditional hybrid path planning algorithms. It not only improves planning efficiency but also adapts to the motion planning requirements of complex environments, providing an efficient solution for robotic motion planning."
10.1109/ACSOS-C52956.2021.00066,BDI-Dojo: developing robust BDI agents in evolving adversarial environments,"The Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) architecture is a widely-used model for developing multi-agent systems. BDI agents pursue their goals over time using a collection of plan recipes that are programmed by the developers. Thus, traditional BDI agents are limited in dealing with dynamic environments where uncertainties are not known beforehand, such as those introduced by adversarial forces. In this paper, we present the BDI-Dojo framework for developing robust BDI agents by training them using reinforcement learning against similarly learning-equipped adversarial agents. This adversarial training approach empowers BDI agents to become more resilient in uncertain, dynamic environments."
10.1109/ACSOS61780.2024.00018,ReBeT: Architecture-based Self-adaptation of Robotic Systems through Behavior Trees,"Robotics software needs to be self-adaptive. Self-adaptation in robotics can, among others, take the form of changing a robot’s task plan or its software architecture at runtime. The latter has shown to be effective in satisfying quality requirements such as minimizing energy consumption and operating safely. However, most self-adaptive robotic systems perform architecture-based self-adaptation to meet the functional goal of completing an assigned mission. Additionally, the mechanisms to accomplish architectural adaptations are mostly adhoc and not oriented towards reuse. We in turn investigate how quality requirements and architecture-based self-adaptation can be facilitated in robotics software while integrating into existing practices to promote practitioners’ adoption and reuse. To this end, we design and implement an extension to the Behavior Trees (BTs) task plan formalism which introduces an explicit consideration of quality requirements. Additionally, we implement a general architectural adaptation layer for ROS2 systems and an extension to BTs which showcases its utilization. Finally, we perform quantitative experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in satisfying quality requirements via architectural adaptation on a mobile terrestrial robot. We find our approach to be an effective means to address a variety of self-adaptation scenarios within the mission of the system."
10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172340,Shape Morphing Microbots for Planetary Exploration,"NASA has expressed a demand for new explorative robotic technology as the search for previously habitable environments progresses. Exploration, utilizing one or few rovers may restrict the scouting range causing a lack of discovery of hidden environments. Current planetary robotic systems contain single robots that have rigid and prebuilt components. All of which have high launch costs and are incapable of exploring extremely rugged environments. Utilizing innovative and low-cost inflatable robot technologies it is possible to conceive short, low-cost, high-risk, high-reward missions. Our current work focuses on networks of cost efficient inflatable Microbots with the intent of rugged environment exploration. These robots deploy inflatables filled with regolith which vary softness allowing them to crawl over obstacles. The generic architecture of these shape-morphing Microbots has been developed and is suitable as a payload on board satellites of size 1U and above. Our future analysis points towards the feasibility of such systems being distributed in large numbers on planetary surfaces while conforming to CubeSat design specifications. The results of our present work will provide insight into the structural dependability, lead to prototype development, texting, and improvement."
10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172592,Development of On-orbit Assembly Demonstrator in 3U CubeSat Form Factor,"The use of robotics in space has become common in the last half century of space exploration. However, robotic arms are rarely entrusted to perform large assembly tasks without a human in the loop because of the high cost of the hardware involved. As our presence in space grows, developing advanced autonomous robotic systems may be the way forward as time lags associated with teleoperation can easily cripple future space missions operating beyond earth orbit. This research focuses on the derivation of an autonomous control system for spacecraft assembly applications that blends Jacobian path following and visual servoing. Jacobian path following assumes the environment is well known and plans end effector trajectories whose performance for assembly may suffer in dynamic or uncertain environments. Visual servoing approaches use feedback from an effector attached camera and can avoid dynamic obstacles, but provides no guarantee of success if the sensor cannot keep the goal location in its field of view and often traverses inefficient manipulator trajectories. This work proposes a hybrid approach that combines both approaches to improve the performance of a robotic manipulator in both known and unknown environments. The robotic systems are simulated using the proposed hybrid controller. The hybrid controller is developed in MATLAB using a kinematic simulation of a two degree of freedom robotic arm operating in a single plane with a simplified camera model. Following successful implementation of the simulation, a more complex robotic arm is simulated in 3D space. The controller is integrated into an existing robotic arm platform (UR5 Industrial Manipulator) for a proof of concept. The results of the testing highlights the path and final position of each controller to demonstrate the advantages of each controller individually and the advantages of the hybrid approach. The paper describes the algorithm development and results of analysis and testing."
10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172595,PHALANX: Expendable projectile sensor networks for planetary exploration,"Technologies enabling long-term, wide-ranging measurement in hard-to-reach areas are a critical need for planetary science inquiry. Phenomena of interest include flows or variations in volatiles, gas composition or concentration, particulate density, or even simply temperature. Improved measurement of these processes enables understanding of exotic geologies and distributions or correlating indicators of trapped water or biological activity. However, such data is often needed in unsafe areas such as caves, lava tubes, or steep ravines not easily reached by current spacecraft and planetary robots. To address this capability gap, we have developed miniaturized, expendable sensors which can be ballistically lobbed from a robotic rover or static lander - or even dropped during a flyover. These projectiles can perform sensing during flight and after anchoring to terrain features. By augmenting exploration systems with these sensors, we can extend situational awareness, perform long-duration monitoring, and reduce utilization of primary mobility resources, all of which are crucial in surface missions. We call the integrated payload that includes a cold gas launcher, smart projectiles, planning software, network discovery, and science sensing: PHALANX. In this paper, we introduce the mission architecture for PHALANX and describe an exploration concept that pairs projectile sensors with a rover “mothership.” Science use cases explored include reconnaissance using ballistic cameras, volatiles detection, and building timelapse maps of temperature and illumination conditions. Strategies to autonomously coordinate constellations of deployed sensors to self-discover and localize with peer ranging (i.e. a “local GPS”) are summarized, thus providing communications infrastructure beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) of the rover. Capabilities were demonstrated through both simulation and physical testing with a terrestrial prototype. The approach to developing a terrestrial prototype is discussed, including design of the launching mechanism, projectile optimization, micro-electronics fabrication, and sensor selection. Results from early testing and characterization of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components are reported. Nodes were subjected to successful burn-in tests over 48 hours at full logging duty cycle. Integrated field tests were conducted in the Roverscape, a half-acre planetary analog environment at NASA Ames, where we tested up to 10 sensor nodes simultaneously coordinating with an exploration rover. Ranging accuracy has been demonstrated to be within +/−10cm over 20m using commodity radios when compared to high-resolution laser scanner ground truthing. Evolution of the design, including progressive miniaturization of the electronics and iterated modifications of the enclosure housing for streamlining and optimized radio performance are described. Finally, lessons learned to date, gaps toward eventual flight mission implementation, and continuing future development plans are discussed."
10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172615,Autonomous Power Grid Formation for Surface Assets Using Multiple Unmanned Ground Vehicles,"Mobile microgrid formation using multiple Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) can establish surface power sources and integrate mission infrastructure autonomously. Advancement of this technology is martialed by the expedited Artemis mission to return to the Moon by 2024, with residence there by 2028. Many of the infrastructure deployment tasks to support this mission will depend on advance assembly by robotic agents. Consider the deployment of multiple Kilopower reactors to supply power to a lunar habitation module, with UGVs to position the reactors and connect power grid elements with cables. To accomplish this complex task, a number of robotic controllers have been integrated on all-terrain UGVs. These controllers comprise waypoint navigation, visual docking, electrical connection coupling, and electrical cable deployment. Hardware which supports the mission includes the UGV platform, odometry and perception sensors, distributed communications, and electrical grid infrastructure. Robot Operating System (ROS) provides a core development architecture. Subsystem tests in an unstructured terrestrial environment have been performed, with a full system test including multiple UGVs planned. This work reports on the current operating capability of subsystems in an outdoor terrestrial environment, and suggests the system-level validation test objectives for power grid formation."
10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172667,A Methodology to Assess the Human Factors Associated with Lunar Teleoperated Assembly Tasks,"Low-latency telerobotics can enable more intricate surface tasks on extraterrestrial planetary bodies than has ever been previously attempted. In order for humanity to create a sustainable lunar presence, well-developed collaboration between humans and robots is necessary to perform complex tasks. This paper presents a methodology to assess the human factors, situational awareness (SA) and cognitive load (CL), associated with teleoperated assembly tasks. Currently, telerobotic assembly on an extraterrestrial body has never been attempted, and a valid methodology to assess the associated human factors has not been developed. The Telerobotics Laboratory at the University of Colorado-Boulder created the Telerobotic Simulation System (TSS) which enables remote operation of a rover and a robotic arm. The TSS was used in a laboratory experiment designed as an analog to a lunar mission. The operator's task was to assemble a radio interferometer. Each participant completed this task under two conditions, remote teleoperation (limited SA) and local operation (optimal SA). The goal of this experiment was to establish a methodology to accurately measure the operator's SA and CL while performing teleoperated assembly tasks. A successful methodology would yield results showing greater SA and lower CL while operating locally. Performance metrics measured in this experiment showed greater SA and lower CL in the local environment, supported by a 27% increase in the mean time to completion of the assembly task when operating remotely. Subjective measurements of SA and CL did not align with the performance metrics. This brought into question the validity of the subjective assessments used in this experiment when applied to telerobotic assembly tasks. Results from this experiment will guide future work attempting to accurately quantify the human factors associated with telerobotic assembly. Once an accurate methodology has been developed, we will be able to measure how new variables affect an operator's SA and CL in order to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of telerobotic assembly tasks."
10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172688,Maintenance-optimized Modular Robotic Concepts for Planetary Surface ISRU Excavators,"Modular robotic concepts are identified and evaluated over the design and operations/maintenance lifecycle for autonomous Lunar, Mars, and partial gravity planetary surface excavation and in-situ earthworks equipment. In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) is the exploitation of available resources at the site of a landed spacecraft on the surface of another planetary body. It is intended that this ISRU excavator concept be capable of material extraction from native regolith, and will be able to operate in a variety of planetary surface environments after initial shakedown on the moon. Using heritage from highly multi-functional, reconfigurable robotic systems like the All-Terrain Hex-Limbed Extra-Terrestrial Explorer (ATHLETE), Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operations Robot (RASSOR), and Mars exploration rovers, we propose a flexible maintenance-optimized mobility platform concept with quick-connect/disconnect features for robotically swappable excavation implements. Dust tolerant torque transmission, power & data docking, thermal fluid connectors, and modular avionics and instrumentation will allow for autonomous swapping of tools, replacement of spares, and longterm maintenance of robotic excavators. The architecture includes modular tools for conventional excavate / scoop / haul / dump / process functions of a terrestrial mining operation on Earth, but also will have the capability to operate and robotically maintain itself without human intervention. The concepts described in this study will provide a suite of technologies, configurations, and operations ready for inclusion into a final flight-ready excavator system."
10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172722,Expectations for Backward Planetary Protection Planning During Mars Sample Return Planning,"During the current phase of robotic exploration, Mars missions plan to search for evidence of extinct or extant biological activity. The conceptual mission architecture for Mars Sample Return (MSR) must demonstrate robust containment and rigorous control of all unsterilized materials as assurance of no inadvertent harm to Earth's biosphere. Launch of NASA's drilling and caching Mars rover in summer 2020 could potentially be the first step in an extraordinary campaign to bring carefully collected and sealed samples of sedimentary and igneous rocks from Mars to Earth for scientific study. As part of this notional architecture, NASA would launch a sample return platform early as 2026 to land near the area explored by the Mars 2020 rover and ESA would launch separately an Earth Return Orbiter (ERO). A small ESA fetch rover would depart from the platform and drive rapidly to locations where samples tubes have been placed on the ground for retrieval. The fetch rover and/or the Mars 2020 rover could return to the platform, allowing a robotic arm to transfer samples tubes into a sample container on a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV). The sample container would be launched and then released by the MAV in Mars orbit where the waiting ERO would capture the container and seal it in a doubled-walled containment canister. Various combinations of sterilization and dust mitigation are under consideration for breaking the chain of contact with putative contaminants. Minimizing the area of surfaces exposed to Martian dust and performing one or more sterilization procedures are key options for compliance with backward planetary protection prior to departure from Mars orbit. Once landed on Earth, entry vehicle inspection followed by additional cleaning and biobarrier deployment would ensure safe handling during transport to a state-of-the-art receiving facility. Herein, we describe NASA and ESAs joint coordination efforts with COSPAR to engage disciplinary experts across academic, regulatory, and industrial organizations to discuss current technology for life detection and sample safety protocols for handling and studying Mars materials on Earth."
10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438257,Autonomous Robot Planning System for In-Space Assembly of Reconfigurable Structures,"Large-scale space structures, such as telescopes or spacecrafts, require suitable in-situ assembly technologies in order to overcome the limitations on payload size and mass of current launch vehicles. In many application scenarios, manual assembly by astronauts is either highly cost-inefficient or not feasible at all due to orbital constraints. However, (semi-) autonomous robotic assembly systems may provide the means to construct larger structures in space in the near future. Modularity is a key concept for such structures, and also for reducing costs in novel spacecraft designs. The advantage of the modular approach lies in the capability to generate a high number of unique assets from a reduced number of building blocks. Thus, spacecrafts can be easily adapted to particular use cases, and could even be reconfigured during their lifetime using a robotic manipulation system. These ideas lie at the core of our current EU project MOSAR (MOdular Spacecraft Assembly and Reconfiguration). Teleoperating a space robotic system from Earth to assemble a modular structure is not straightforward. Major difficulties are related to time delays, communication losses, limited control modalities, and low immersion for the operator. Autonomous robotic operations are then preferred, and with this goal we propose a fully autonomous system for planning in-space assembly tasks. Our system is able to generate assembly and reconfiguration plans for modular structures in terms of high-level actions that can autonomously be executed by a robot. Through multiple simulation layers, the system automatically verifies the feasibility and correctness of action sequences created by the planner. The layers implement different levels of abstraction, hierarchically stacked to detect infeasible transitions and initiate replanning at an early stage. Levels of abstraction increase in complexity, ranging from a basic geometric description of the spacecraft, over kinematics of the robotic setup, to full representations of the actions. The system reuses information from failed checks in all layers to avoid similar situations during replanning. We use a hybrid approach where symbolic reasoning is combined with considerations of physical constraints to generate a holistic sequence of actions. We demonstrate our planner for large space structures in a simulation environment. In particular, we consider the reconfiguration of a given modular structure, i.e. disassemble parts and reassemble them in a new configuration.

In many application scenarios, manual assembly by astronauts is either highly cost-inefficient or not feasible at all due to orbital constraints. However, (semi-) autonomous robotic assembly systems may provide the means to construct larger structures in space in the near future. Modularity is a key concept for such structures, and also for reducing costs in novel spacecraft designs. The advantage of the modular approach lies in the capability to generate a high number of unique assets from a reduced number of building blocks. Thus, spacecrafts can be easily adapted to particular use cases, and could even be reconfigured during their lifetime using a robotic manipulation system. These ideas lie at the core of our current EU project MOSAR (MOdular Spacecraft Assembly and Reconfiguration). Teleoperating a space robotic system from Earth to assemble a modular structure is not straightforward. Major difficulties are related to time delays, communication losses, limited control modalities, and low immersion for the operator. Autonomous robotic operations are then preferred, and with this goal we propose a fully autonomous system for planning in-space assembly tasks. Our system is able to generate assembly and reconfiguration plans for modular structures in terms of high-level actions that can autonomously be executed by a robot. Through multiple simulation layers, the system automatically verifies the feasibility and correctness of action sequences created by the planner. The layers implement different levels of abstraction, hierarchically stacked to detect infeasible transitions and initiate replanning at an early stage. Levels of abstraction increase in complexity, ranging from a basic geometric description of the spacecraft, over kinematics of the robotic setup, to full representations of the actions. The system reuses information from failed checks in all layers to avoid similar situations during replanning. We use a hybrid approach where symbolic reasoning is combined with considerations of physical constraints to generate a holistic sequence of actions. We demonstrate our planner for large space structures in a simulation environment. In particular, we consider the reconfiguration of a given modular structure, i.e. disassemble parts and reassemble them in a new configuration. The adaptability of our planning system is shown by executing the assembly plans on robots with different sets of skills and in scenarios with simulated hardware failures. © 2021 IEEE."
10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438347,An Innovative Approach to Modeling VIPER Rover Software Life Cycle Cost,"NASA's “Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover” (VIPER) will be the first robotic mission to prospect for water ice near the south pole of the Moon in late 2023 on a 100-Earth-day mission. The information that the VIPER rover provides will help improve understanding of the composition, distribution, and accessibility of Lunar polar volatiles and will help determine how the Moon's resources can support future human space exploration. VIPER, however, represents a radical departure from the way that NASA has traditionally developed planetary robotic missions. A key consequence of these differences is that estimating the cost of VIPER's rover software is challenging and complex. For example, VIPER is being developed using management procedures typically applied to NASA research and technology projects, rather than space flight programs. In addition, key portions of the rover's software are being designed as ground software to run on mission control computers (rather than onboard the rover as flight software as with prior planetary missions) taking advantage of continuous, interactive data communications between the Moon and Earth and higher performance computing available on the ground. Moreover, the rover's software is being engineered using Agile software development practices and incorporates a significant amount of open-source code, rather than following traditional (spiral, waterfall, etc.) development methods and in-house code. In this paper, we present an innovative process to estimate the life cycle cost of VIPER's rover software. We first describe how we modeled the architecture and code counts for three software elements: Rover Flight Software (RFSW), Rover Ground Software (RGSW), and Rover Simulation Software (RSIM). We then discuss key challenges and unique aspects of our approach, such as the lack of Lunar rover analogies, the need to integrate and test large open source software, and the strategies developed to account for use of non-space flight management practices and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conclude with a summary of our results, including cumulative distribution, nearest neighbors and cluster analysis, as well as heuristics used to confirm the reasonableness of the cost estimate."
10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438399,Hybrid Planning System for In-Space Robotic Assembly of Telescopes using Segmented Mirror Tiles,"The use of large telescopes is increasingly important in the field of astronomy. However, for larger telescopes there is a technological limit for producing primary mirrors made of a single rigid piece. A similar problem arises for space-based telescopes, where the cargo areas of launch vehicles provide an upper limit for the maximum aperture of the telescope, even if it is deployable as the James Webb Space Telescope. As larger telescopes are required, in-space assembly emerges as a feasible alternative, making use of a highly autonomous robotic system that directly constructs the structure on orbit. Although this might reduce the overall costs of construction and maintenance of the structures, such robotization brings additional challenges for an automatic planning system. This paper presents the study and implementation of an autonomous assembly planner for in-space robotic assembly of telescopes using segmented mirror tiles. The proposed planner takes into consideration different constraints. On the one hand, robot physical constraints such as joint position and torque limits, and moments of inertia of the sub-assemblies must be considered. On the other hand, semantic constraints representing the possible types of connections between tiles must be specified to ensure the mechanical stability and electric and data connectivity within the structure. In order to generate a plan that considers these constraints, we propose a hybrid assembly planner with a global and a local layer. The global layer uses graph search strategies to explore a graph representation of possible assembly sequences, ensuring that the potential solutions fulfill all the semantic constraints describing the allowed connections between tiles. The local layer uses a constrained path planning algorithm combined with a dynamic simulation to ensure that the transitions between states (representing sub-assemblies) fulfill the required physical constraints. The final assembly sequence to be executed is selected by minimizing a suitable cost function. The planner is integrated into a ground-based demonstrator for autonomous robotic assembly of mirror tiles, developed within the PULSAR EU Project. Simulations for larger telescope structures demonstrate the generality of the approach. In order to illustrate the flexibility of the planner, different physical constraints and optimization goals were implemented and verified. The planner successfully adapts the assembly plan accordingly."
10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438470,FRESCO: A Framework for Spacecraft Systems Autonomy,"Achieving the science exploration and defense goals of the following decades will require flight systems capable of operations with limited operator contact, system mode changes and retasking based on sensor data, and complex robotic operations. To support these capabilities, increasingly autonomous flight systems are required that can perform dedicated mission functions, e.g. payload targeting and communications, and system-level functions, e.g. planning and goal monitoring. Architecting an autonomous system requires a well-reasoned, self-consistent framework to avoid ad hoc design choices that will introduce complexity and risk. The Framework for Robust Execution and Scheduling of Commands On-Board, FRESCO, is the result of lessons learned in developing a software architecture to enable autonomous solar system exploration. FRESCO generalizes this work to offer a modular, software-agnostic approach to developing verifiable architecture for autonomous space systems. FRESCO specifies guiding principles, functions, interfaces, and interactions from which mission-specific autonomous control architectures can be derived. FRESCO is a principled framework relying on explicit, state-based goal definitions, centralized management of state knowledge, clearly separated control boundaries, and hierarchical reasoning. Using components from FRESCO reference architecture, an autonomous decision-making architecture can be designed for spacecraft which can then be mapped to flight software architecture. FRESCO is flexibly defined to enable autonomous control of flight systems built using extensive software and hardware heritage. Finally, FRESCO-derived architectures support a spectrum of operator/spacecraft interactions, ranging from traditional commanding to goal-driven commanding with the ability to change mission goals autonomously. FRESCO has been used in defining the autonomy architectures for the ASTERIA mission and have been demonstrated in laboratory and software simulation for small body rendezvous and in-space servicing missions."
10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438539,Gateway Avionics Concept of Operations for Command and Data Handling Architecture,"By harnessing data handling lessons learned from the International Space Station, Gateway has adopted a highly reliable, deterministic, and redundant three-plane Time-Triggered Ethernet network implementation that is capable of handling three distinct types of traffic: Time-Triggered (TT), Rate Constrained (RC) and Best Effort (BE). This paper will offer an overview of the operational capabilities of the Gateway Network defined in the Network Concept of Operations, focusing on the initial architecture of the Gateway Spacecraft Inter-Element Network. The initial Gateway modules include Habitation, Power & Propulsion, Logistics, Human Lunar Lander, and Orion Crew Capsule. The Gateway Inter-Element Network Concept of Operations is a source for the network functions, which in turn inform the design, development, implementation, testing, and verification of the spacecraft hardware. End system hardware on the network includes, but is not limited to, a mobile robotic arm, internal and external cameras, flight control hardware, environmental control systems, power and propulsion systems, critical alarms, telemetry, and payloads, in addition to any hardware present on a visiting vehicle or lunar exploration vehicle. This paper will also provide an overview of how the design and operations of the Gateway Avionics network are defined by the Gateway Program design and safety requirements. Implementation of avionics and command and data handling strategy will provide the Gateway program with reliable infrastructures that allow operational options for both human control while occupied, and highly autonomous control during periods of vacancy. The Gateway Avionics network architecture will be able to handle seamless in-flight reconfigurations and expansion as new modules and the capability to interface with additional visiting vehicles are added."
10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843445,Expert-Informed Autonomous Science Planning for In-situ Observations and Discoveries,"Future planetary exploration missions on the surface of distant bodies such as Europa or Enceladus can't rely on human-in-the-loop operations due to time delays, dynamic environments, limited mission lifetimes, as well as the many unknown unknowns inherent in the exploration of such environments. Thus our robotic explorers must be capable of autonomous operations to ensure continued operations and to try to maximize the amount and quality of the scientific data gathered from each mission. To advance our technology toward this goal, we are developing a system to maximize the science obtained by a robotic lander and delivered to scientists on Earth with minimal asynchronous human interaction. The autonomy architecture consists of three main components: Shared Science Value Maps (SSVMs), which function as an interface between REASON (Robust Exploration with Autonomous Science onboard) and RECOURSE (Ranked Evaluation of Contingent Opportunities for Uninterrupted Remote Science Exploration) for efficient and useful scientific communication between scientists and robot. The key advantage to this design is in its ability to continuously operate and adapt despite the constraints of high-latency, low-bandwith communications and an uncertain environment which today would require ground-in-the-loop operations. This paper presents the overview of our architecture and initial results on the development of such a system. These results will focus on progress made in developing the details of the SSVM interface between human scientists and robotic explorer and the ability of REASON to act on the SSVM to develop plans on-board that attempt to maximize science obtained while being guaranteed to respect any relevant system and safety constraints."
10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843530,Hybrid Planning to Minimize Platform Disturbances during In-orbit Assembly Tasks,"In-orbit space assembly has been proposed as a method to overcome the obstacles for deployment of large spatial structures. To make such assemblies economically feasible, they must rely on robotic arms to perform the required manipulation actions. The operations with the robotic arm inevitably affect the attitude and orientation of the spacecraft. This influence is well understood for simple trajectories; however, assembly sequences for full structures require multiple repetitive motions, with and without load, which significantly affect the attitude and orbital control of the satellite. This paper analyzes such perturbations for a complex assembly task, the construction of the primary mirror for a space telescope, using a hybrid planner with two levels: a low level that considers individual motions of the robotic arm, and a high level that generates the overall assembly sequence while minimizing the perturbations created on the attitude control system. The method effectively minimizes perturbations during orbital assembly tasks, therefore minimizing fuel or energy consumption in the spacecraft."
10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843610,Towards a Semi-Autonomous Robotic Exploration of a Lunar Skylight Cavity,"This study evaluates the feasibility of a robotic exploration mission to a skylight located in the Marius Hills region on Moon. The study is based on theoretical evaluations while making use of existing results from previous and currently running projects. Parts of the approach were already evaluated by autonomously navigating and mapping in a lava tube and other field trials in analogue environments. We address a solution to access and map a lunar lava tube with a semi-autonomous heterogenous team of exploration rovers. Main systems are: 1) a surface rover, which serves as anchoring point, communication relay and power generator, 2) a highly mobile exploration micro rover foreseen to rappel down into the skylight for tube exploration and 3) a tether management and docking system which can be attached to the exploration rover to safely lower it into the lava tube and serve as power and communication hub during cave exploration. For descending we propose a rappelling approach using tethering and actively controlled hybrid legged-wheels on the exploration rover. The rover uses path planning to avoid obstacles on its way down the vertical surface. When the bottom of the skylight is reached, the tether spool is deployed as docking station. After successful deployment, different autonomy levels are possible -from remote-controlled to fully autonomous- to explore the unknown environment."
10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843722,Test as you Fly: Using Flight Telemetry in the Mars 2020 Uplink Simulation & Validation Process,"Mars2020's approach to command load simulation & validation steered away from heritage design early on in Mission System development. Whereas previous missions used Sequence Generator (SeqGen) to validate their command load, Mars2020 chose to adapt software originally developed for Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), Surface Simulation (SSim), in order to meet new mission performance requirements. This decision meant a complete redesign of the surface mission uplink commanding validation architecture, but it also provided room for meaningful improvements. SSim is a Flight Software (FSW)-in-the-loop sequence and command simulator, enabling much faster than real-time execution. It was originally developed for MSL Rover Planners to simulate and validate their commanding of rover mobility, robotic arm, and sampling activities. For Mars2020, SSim has since been expanded to include the modeling of system-level functions such as power, telecommunications, and instruments. It affords the operations team the ability to simulate commanding in a very flight-like manner, a significant change from the heritage process involving the use of SeqGen. Using a FSW-in-the-loop simulator for uplink command validation provides several key advantages over heritage simulation tools. Because of the similarity between SSim and the rover FSW, the Mars2020 validation process is able to routinely incorporate the latest known state of the flight vehicle into the validation tools, ensuring that the simulation and validation initial condition used in uplink planning is the best possible representation of the onboard state. A set of new tools and new and improved processes developed for Mars2020 enable this usage of flight vehicle state in uplink planning, and by doing so, prevent divergence between spacecraft state tracked on the ground and the real state of the rover on Mars. The adoption of SSim for uplink command validation completely redesigned the surface validation process. The development of this design presented many novel challenges resulting in key decisions and trades that could not directly leverage heritage designs or experience. This study will discuss the formulation of, and key decisions involved in, the Mars2020 surface validation process architecture in hopes of serving as a blueprint for future missions."
10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843799,Design and Model Predictive Control of a Mars Coaxial Quadrotor,"Mars has been a prime candidate for planetary explo-ration of the solar system because of the science discoveries that support chances of future habitation on this planet. The Mars exploration landers and rovers have laid the foundation of our understanding of the planet's atmosphere and terrain. However, the rovers have presented limitations in terms of their pace, travers ability, and exploration capabilities from the ground and thus, one of the main field of interest for future robotic mission to Mars is to enhance the autonomy of this exploration vehicles. Martian caves and lava tubes like terrains, which consists of uneven ground, poor visibility and confined space, makes it impossible for wheel based rovers to navigate through these areas. In order to address these limitations and advance the exploration capability in a Martian terrain, this article presents the design and control of a novel coaxial quadrotor Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV). As it will be presented, the key contributions on the design and control architecture of the proposed Mars coaxial quadrotor, are introducing an alternative and more enhanced, from a control point of view concept, when compared in terms of autonomy to Ingenuity. Based on the presented design, the article will introduce the mathematical modelling and automatic control framework of the vehicle that will consist of a linearised model of a co-axial quadrotor and a corresponding Model Pre-dictive Controller (MPC) for the trajectory tracking. Among the many models, proposed for the aerial flight on Mars, a reliable control architecture lacks in the related state of the art. The MPC based closed loop responses of the proposed MAV will be verified in different conditions during the flight with additional disturbances, induced to replicate a real flight scenario. For the model validation purpose, the Mars coaxial quadrotor is sim-ulated inside a Martian environment with related atmospheric conditions in the Gazebo simulator, which will use the proposed MPC controller for following an a priory defined trajectory. In order to further validate the proposed control architecture and prove the efficacy of the suggested design, the introduced Mars coaxial quadrotor and the MPC scheme will be compared to a PID-type controller, similar to the Ingenuity helicopter's control architecture for the position and the heading."

10.1109/AERO55745.2023.10115601,Hardware Autonomy for Space Infrastructure,"NASA prioritizes autonomous systems development with the expectation that it will continue to drive significant improvements in human and science exploration capability. Crew operations benefit from a spectrum of machine assistance to complete replacement of dangerous or highly repetitive tasks. Many science operations have a teleoperation component, and similarly benefit from a range of autonomy implementations that make long distance applications feasible. As we consider longer duration deep space missions, we also consider higher levels of autonomy in order meet emergent safety, maintenance, and logistics needs. One of the challenges within this scope is installation and maintenance of infrastructure, such as large scale instrumentation and communications equipment, crew habitats, and operational facilities. We describe how a programmable meta-material architecture may shift the paradigm of how we design, build, and operate future space infrastructure and assets. A primary objective of this strategy is to free the design space from launch vehicle constraints and fundamentally shift how a mission is designed and conducted. This integrates advances in materials (mechanical meta-materials), manufacturing (cooperative mobile robotics), and autonomy (multi-agent planning algorithms). Engineering systems that utilize a modular and reconfiguration building block approach, such as digital communication and computation systems, currently lead in terms of size and complexity scalability. NASA is extending the benefits and flexibility of digital systems to hardware systems, to optimize materials life-cycle management and expand our space exploration mission capabilities to meet long duration and deep space infrastructure needs, in accordance with long term NASA goals of “in-space reliance” and “mass-less exploration.”"
10.1109/AERO55745.2023.10115804,The Evolution of Command and Sequencing at JPL: Origins and Flight Software Core Lineage,"Since launching the first American satellite Explorer 1 in 1958, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has led the world in robotic space exploration. Throughout the history of the lab, subsequent missions have traveled deeper into space, explored more challenging environments, lasted longer, attempted more ambitious science, and returned orders of magnitude more data. This paper is the first in a planned series to document the history of how JPL has commanded its spacecraft in order to achieve the increasingly daring and demanding goals of its missions. This first effort focuses primarily on the onboard technologies associated with JPL's Flight Software (FSW) Core Product Line (FCPL), the Mars rover missions that preceded it, and the Cassini mission to Saturn. It also provides a brief discussion of pre-Cassini missions in order to provide context. Other JPL sequencing technologies (namely VML and the open source F Prime Flight Software) are not discussed in detail here but will instead be the subject of future work, as will any detailed discussions on ground-based software developed to support JPL projects and the interface between onboard autonomy and sequencing. The paper explores the challenges of the more assembly-like sequencing languages common before the mid-1990s (Cassini), the significant paradigm shift that came with the Faster, Better, Cheaper era and Mars Pathfinder (MPF), the development of conditional sequencing for the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER), the SPAM scripting language of Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) and Mars 2020 (M20), the latest developments in the deep space orbiters Psyche and Europa Clipper, and a preliminary look at Sample Retrieval Lander (SRL). VML is also discussed as needed to contextualize the features in JPL's sequencing architecture that were written in response to it. The paper also explores the broader concept of spacecraft behavior. Modern spacecraft behave in highly complex ways and sequencing is only one place where spacecraft designers and operators can encode that complexity. As such, the trades needed to define a sequencing system must take this broader landscape into account. Other important modes of encoding spacecraft behavior include physical hardware, flight software, and real time commanding. Finally, the paper discusses the flexibility JPL's different command and control solutions give to operators to change behaviors in flight. While some sequencing systems are robust enough to resolve complex anomalies or react to unforeseen circumstances in flight, many are not. Historically, JPL's flight system designers have provided many methods to change behavior outside of the normal cadence of design and test, creating a large trade space to do so in flight."
10.1109/AERO55745.2023.10115827,Design of a Novel Lunar Transportation System (FLOAT) consisting of Diamagnetically-Levitated Robots on a Flexible Film Track,"A durable, long-life robotic transport system will be critical to the daily operations of a sustainable lunar base in the 2030's, as envisioned in NASA's Moon to Mars plan and mission concepts like the Robotic Lunar Surface Operations 2 (RLSO2), to transport regolith mined for ISRU consumables (H2O, LOX, LH2) or construction, and transport payloads around the lunar base and to / from landing zones or other outposts. In this work, we present component analysis, preliminary experimental results, and system designs for a novel lunar transportation system, FLOAT (Flexible Levitation on a Track), that leverages diamagnetically levitated robots. Unlike current lunar robot concepts that use wheels (SEV, RASSOR), legs (Spidernaut), or hybrid wheels-on-legs for mobility, FLOAT robots are solid-state (no motors, gearboxes, or other moving parts) and consist only of permanent magnets connected in planar arrays levitating to minimize lunar dust abrasion / wear over a flexible PCB track that generates electromagnetic thrust. Results show that FLOAT robots can maintain extremely low power requirements over a range of terrains – using <5 W/m2 or <0.15 W/kg to carry up to 30 kg/m2 payload on tracks with slopes <40° and curves >5 m in-plane radius or >25 m out-of-plane radius – and use 10-100x less power for transport than wheeled vehicles. For initial system deployment, we designed track deployments robots which can leverage existing lunar robotic systems to un- roll segments of FLOAT tracks onto the lunar regolith. Finally, system design analysis shows the FLOAT concept can serve as a complete transportation system to satisfy the volumetric flow requirements of the RLSO2 mission concept."
10.1109/AERO55745.2023.10115856,An Analysis of Exploration Capability Gaps for Future Habitation Systems to Inform Risk Assessment and Development Priorities,"Within NASA, exploration capability gaps are defined as the difference between the current state-of-the-art in capabilities and the anticipated needs of future human spaceflight architectures. As NASA and its partners' capabilities for human exploration of deep space continue to mature, it is necessary to understand the capability gaps that require closure to support future habitation systems, such as the Lunar Surface Habitat (SH) and Mars Transit Habitat (TH) currently in concept development. This paper will identify high-priority capability gaps for exploration habitation and show potential options for gap closure through investment in technology, development, and testing. High-priority capability gaps are divided into the following general taxonomy areas: human health/life support/habitation systems, flight computing and avionics, power and energy storage, communications and navigation, thermal management systems, human exploration destination systems, autonomous systems, sensors and instruments, GNC (guidance, navigation, and control), robotic systems, ground and uncrewed surface systems, and materials/structures/mechanical systems/manufacturing. In the gap identification process, teams of discipline experts from across NASA reviewed the latest habitation architecture needs against current capabilities to understand where gaps may exist. The results of the assessment established a basis for the current state-of-the-art within each gap and identified the capability needs of the proposed exploration missions the gap links to. An assessment of how each test platform (e.g., Ground, International Space Station (ISS), Commercial Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Gateway) may be leveraged to mature capabilities and potentially provide a route to gap closure will be discussed. The notional timeline for gap closure to support reference missions and impacts to overall schedule are also assessed where appropriate. Based on the capability gap analysis described above, the paper summarizes important technology maturation considerations for human exploration architectures, with a focus on the Mars TH. The previously published NASA habitation ground rules and assumptions document is used as the basis to classify gaps as enabling, enhancing, or “push” opportunities for a particular architecture. Stepwise technology maturation plans/considerations are presented for some selected critical gaps. Overall, the analysis in this paper is intended to help influence development priorities for habitation systems, where high-priority, critical gaps are those currently assessed as having a low probability of closure by the anticipated need date. Capability gap analysis also informs the risk register for exploration habitation systems and mitigation strategies to ensure readiness of key technologies to support future mission timelines. Linkage between capability gaps for Moon and Mars is noted, as closure of a gap at a Lunar destination may subsequently enable or enhance Mars TH architectures."
10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10520998,Ground-Assisted Position Navigation and Timing (PNT) for Moon and Mars,"The recent exploration initiatives for robotic and human missions to the Moon and Mars require long-term communications and navigation infrastructures that provide accurate and autonomous PNT services for orbiting and surface users. NASA launched the Lunar Communication Relay and Navigation System (LCRNS) project in 2022 to meet the needs of the Artemis missions and other lunar missions. ESA, JAXA, other space agencies, and commercial entities may contribute additional lunar relay orbiters that are compatible with the NASA’s orbiters via the LunaNet Interoperability Specifications.To ensure sustained human presence at the Moon, NASA plans to deploy surface infrastructure elements that can survive the lunar nights. We are investigating the operation concept and PNT performance of augmenting the lunar relay network with a surface station with the following capabilities: 1. Provide short-range time distribution to orbiting and surface spacecraft. 2. Transmit a GNSS-like signal to augment the orbital determination (OD) schemes of lunar spacecraft for fast OD convergence. The transmitter can also act as a surface beacon that guides the lunar spacecraft during dynamic events like decent and ascent. 3. Receive lunar relay orbiter’s and Earth’s GPS signals and estimate corrections for orbiting spacecraft. This enables improved OD performance and accurate relative navigation of users on the lunar surface. The Joint Doppler Ranging (JDR) method requires as few as one orbiter to perform a real-time position fix of a surface user. This is particularly useful during the early stage of lunar relay network deployment when the number of orbiters is small.The lunar surface station architecture is directly applicable to the Mars relay network, and this supports the NASA Moon-to-Mars initiative."
10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521039,Planning and Control for Autonomous Drives of the Mars Sample Recovery Helicopter,"The Mars Sample Return (MSR) campaign is humanity’s first attempt at returning samples from the Martian surface to Earth. This campaign is composed of multiple spacecraft, landers and robotic systems that collaborate to collect, retrieve, and ultimately return a diverse set of Martian rock and regolith samples. The Sample Recovery Helicopter (SRH) is a team of hybrid aerial-ground robots designed as a backup system to transport sample tubes from the surface of Mars to the Sample Retrieval Lander (SRL) for transport to Earth. An SRH robot is required to perform accurate drives from helipads to sample tube pick up or drop off locations and to handle sample tubes with a manipulator arm. The mobility system has a four wheel skid-steer configuration with 10cm diameter wheels, a maximum rock-height traversal capability of 5.0cm, and a total mass of less than 150g. This paper presents the system-level design of the autonomy system for driving SRH during surface operations. A prototype platform is used to quantitatively evaluate a motion planning and control strategy to position the robot above a desired pose in preparation for sample-tube pick ups. Results demonstrate that this autonomous system is capable of driving the skid-steer platform to within the required sample tube to end-effector pose error of ±2cm in x, ±4cm in y, and ±5° in yaw."
10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521067,Gateway Autonomy for Enabling Deep Space Exploration,"The Gateway spacecraft is an important steppingstone to exploration of the solar system, integrating commercial and international partners into a tightly coupled system, enabling cislunar activities, and implementing key technologies for missions to Mars. Autonomy is a capability area necessary to handle long communication outages where intervention from Earth is impossible, to prepare to operate with long communication delays that will be common in interplanetary travel, and to make spaceflight more affordable and accessible by reducing sustaining operations costs. The Gateway Concept of Operations states that one of Gateway’s goals is to “focus on infrastructure and systems that will allow autonomous operations aboard the Gateway with robotics, automated systems, advanced communications, and distributed computing.”Gateway’s Vehicle Systems Manager (VSM) and associated Autonomous Spacecraft Management Architecture (ASMA) are key products towards delivering autonomous capability. The primary functions of the control architecture are Mission Management and Timeline Execution, Resource Management, Fault Management, and Vehicle Control and Operation (VCO). In each of these areas, there is an initial level of capability to be delivered at launch, with plans to continue development and grow to greater capability. The initial deployment of VSM will focus on maintaining vehicle safety by focusing on full fault management capabilities and deploying only enough resource and timeline planning functionality to support that. The final deployment of VSM will add significant planning and control optimization functionality to support nominal operations for up to 21 days without ground support, even accommodating fault and failure conditions. While the VSM is the vehicle-level representation of autonomous reasoning, distributed automation is essential to provide the right scope and abstraction of information to process. Module and system support of automation and simplicity of interfaces are two important design paradigms that Gateway is focusing on to garner a systems approach to autonomy. Distribution of reasoning can increase complexity, so Gateway is also taking a strict hierarchical approach to information flow and decision making.VSM is not the only capability necessary to achieve an autonomous spacecraft. Robotics support for maintenance of the spacecraft will be essential to provide continued vehicle functionality even when crew is not present. Technical and programmatic challenges exist when implementing autonomous robotics operations. These challenges include sufficient network flexibility to support data transfer to the rest of the vehicle to coordinate module-to-module robotic walk-offs and finding the proper interfaces to allow sufficient dexterity. Communication system upgrades planned for Gateway include Delay Tolerant Networking to best utilize the complex network of relays that will be part of mature cislunar operations. Distributed computing and management will provide failure tolerance, robustness, and growth of capabilities while still allowing significant reuse of heritage software on heritage systems as well as reuse of common applications across a spacecraft to minimize new development, but this requires adherence to key standards and interfaces.The Gateway program has demonstrated significant progress towards these capabilities and has identified challenges other spacecraft developers should be aware of from the start."
10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521083,Design and Development of a Martian Assistant Rover for Astronaut Safety During Surface Exploration,"The exploration of extraterrestrial environments pertaining to the Moon-Mars expedition poses substantial challenges for astronauts, including extended periods of isolation, physical strain, and exposure to hazardous conditions. Considering this, development of integrated robotic systems that ensure human safety and enable maximum science and exploration during Martian missions is vital for optimal mission executions.In this paper, we propose to develop a rover assistant specifically designed for supporting the initial astronaut exploration of Mars. The primary objective of this rover is to provide assistance in diverse exploration activities and experimental endeavors, all while prioritizing the safety of the expedition team. The mission concept involves the utilization of a transportation rover to reach a specified destination. Subsequently, astronauts will be accompanied by an assistant rover to conduct site exploration. The human explorers will focus their investigations on the relatively accessible and safe regions, while the rover will traverse the more complex and hazardous terrains.As the knowledge of the red planet deepens, it is becoming apparent that many high value science targets are either craters, caves, steep hills or valleys, locations inaccessible to the conventional rocker bogie mobility systems. This paper presents a novel rover design featuring a modified hybrid mobility system. The proposed design incorporates a hexapod configuration adapted from the hybrid rover ATHLETE, modified to create a mobility system suitable for autonomous exploration. The rover will also house a vine robot for exploration of caves, crevices and deep holes which are practically inaccessible or dangerous for the rover. The front-mounted camera of the vine robot will have the capability to explore these locations in infrared wavelength for ice detection. The rover has various exploration instruments on-board which will play a vital role in gathering data for scientific research and informed decision-making, thereby enabling its automation. It employs machine vision algorithms and real-time image processing for its autonomous navigation. The rover payload contains equipment designed to offer medical support, supplementary resources, physical assistance for medical emergencies or extended exploration missions. As a part of the health monitoring architecture for this concept, the rover employs AI algorithms to analyze the data, promptly detect anomalies or health risks, and send timely alerts to the Martian surface outpost.The paper outlines the mechanical design of this rover concept and the algorithm techniques for its autonomous navigation. It also discusses the technical and operational parameters that include the subsystems, functionality, and communication system of this Martian assistant rover. The findings of this study will establish a foundation for future research. It will contribute to the advancement of long-duration space exploration for future manned missions to celestial bodies beyond our solar system."
10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521103,Collaborative Moonwalkers,"We present the results of an advanced concept research for a collective of robotic rovers named Moonwalkers that implement bio-inspired motivations, distributed intelligence, and integrated deep learning techniques to demonstrate autonomous cooperative goal-directed lunar exploration with minimum human interventions. By borrowing concepts from biology, the Moonwalker rovers are driven by a set of balanced motivations (ex. Energy, safety, operating temperature, achievements, respect) to accomplish mission goals while maintaining safety from potential dangers. Drawing from contemporary neuroscience and computer science research, the Moonwalker rovers are equipped with system 1 (low-level) and system 2 (high-level) cognitive functions based on a two-level memory architecture utilizing a pre-trained multi-modal model in conjunction with a graph knowledgebase, which leverages knowledge graph embeddings. This neuro-symbolic approach enables the rovers to learn from and be guided by human knowledge, facilitating zero-shot learning, collaborative planning, and reasoning like human explorers under uncertain conditions. We also describe the construction of a virtual simulation environment with high-fidelity visualizations and prototype rover agents. By addressing selected problems, we demonstrate that physics informed machine learning can enhance the effectiveness of the virtual lunar test environment."
10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521154,METIS: An AI Assistant Enabling Autonomous Spacecraft Operations for Human Exploration Missions,"Today, human space exploration faces persistent and new challenges. Most prominently limited crew size, limits on crew time and utilization, as well as the costs of 24/7/365 operations are the main drivers for innovations towards increased autonomy. Furthermore, in the future, when considering destinations beyond lunar orbit, signal delay simply prevents the conventional operational concept of real-time monitoring and control for crewed missions. To overcome those challenges, this paper will introduce METIS, the Mars Exploration Telemetry-driven Information System. METIS is a novel intelligent assistant enabling autonomous operations of crewed spacecraft based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). METIS is currently being developed at the Columbus Control-Center (Col-CC), which is part of the German Space Operations Center (GSOC). On behalf of the European Space Agency (ESA), Col-CC is responsible for the operation of the Columbus module of the International Space Station (ISS). Columbus was launched on February 7, 2008, docked to the ISS a few days later on February 11 and has been a part of the ISS since then. It is the basis on which METIS is developed. The assistant is designed after John L. Boyds OODA (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) loop for human decision making, where each function in the model is developed as an individual computerized agent. This paper will introduce the high-level system architecture of this multi-agent-system (MAS), as well as human interaction embedded in the system. Furthermore, we will show each of the agents in greater detail, their functions and the interaction between the agents. Since some agents rely on machine learning (ML) from the field of artificial intelligence (AI) we use multiple data sources from the Columbus module, including but not limited to on-board telemetry, operational data files (ODFs, i.e. procedures), and anomaly reports, to train and test the system. We will highlight how these data sources are brought together and the database we deploy to enable access to the data in a machine-readable format. Since METIS is intended to be used by both ground personnel, as well as on-board crew, we will show how METIS is planned to be utilized within Col-CC and on-board. For this we envision a step-wise approach, where METIS is first used and tested in conjunction with the Columbus simulator to perform certain ground and on-board activities and react to a set of known anomalies. In this first step ground controllers will still be heavily involved in development, to identify areas that need further improvements and further increase the capabilities of the system. This work represents a significant step towards full crew autonomy by supporting quick and reliable decision making in the highly dynamic environment that is human space exploration. AI/ML enabled solutions to new and old challenges have the potential to revolutionize the space sector and METIS represents one possible contribution to make space more accessible to humans, increase system reliability, reduce cost of operations and help prepare for deep space exploration beyond lunar orbit."
10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521183,Hybrid Motion Planner for a Multi-Armed Robot Performing On-orbit Loco-manipulation Tasks,"Large space infrastructure is gaining increasing attention in recent years, including e.g. solar power plants in space or space stations. However, these structures normally are not sent in one piece due to current launch vehicles’ size and load capacity limitations. An alternative is to send individual components and subassemblies and perform the final assembly of structures in orbit, mainly using robotic manipulators that execute simple manipulation tasks. However, fixed manipulator systems have limited reachability; therefore, new approaches are required to endow robotic systems with extended mobility and enhanced versatility.Several European projects have developed initial prototypes of robotic systems that could execute On-orbit services. In the MOSAR project, a 7 degrees of freedom (DoF) Walking Manipulator (WM) robot performed locomotion and manipulation (loco-manipulation) tasks for the assembly of modular satellites. In this project, the robot and the modules of the satellite were equipped with Standard Interconnects (SI), which provide mechanical, power, and data connectivity for the different components and also enable a straightforward way for their manipulation using a suitable SI as a robotic end effector. A ground scenario was developed to evaluate the system under laboratory conditions. To enhance the reachability and mobility of the WM, the project MIRROR, funded by ESA, pursued the development of a Multi-Armed Robot (MAR) capable of executing loco-manipulation tasks to assemble modular space structures. This system consists of three robotic subsystems, two 7-DoF arms attached to a torso with an extra DoF on its base.This paper presents a hybrid motion planner for generating trajectories for loco-manipulation tasks using the MAR system. The developed hybrid planner combines a high-level layer that determines the necessary contact states between the robot and the structure, and a low-level layer that plans the joint trajectories among contiguous contact states. The high-level planner implements task-dependent heuristics and a depth-first search approach to reduce the search time for possible contact states. The low-level layer implements an optimization-based motion planner, in particular the Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Motion Planning (STOMP). Using an optimization-based approach reduces the random component associated typically with sampling-based motion planners, thus generating as well smoother trajectories. STOMP used as objective function the minimization of joint torques required for executing the different tasks. The performance of the MAR system is evaluated in simulation and on a ground demonstration scenario that simulates the assembly of a modular primary mirror of a space telescope, demonstrating different tasks, including robotic locomotion and manipulation of the mirror parts."
10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521209,Immersive Technologies for Human-in-the-Loop Lunar Surface Simulations,"NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, continually seeks innovative solutions to enhance its operations, particularly in the realms of testing, evaluation, and training for future missions. Immersive technologies, such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality have proven to be powerful tools for immersing users in realistic, interactive, and engaging environments. This paper explores how the Simulation and Graphics Branch at NASA’s Johnson Space Center (JSC) leverages immersive technology, modern commercial rendering engines, and physics-based systems simulations to develop human-in-the-loop systems for humanity’s return to the Moon through the Artemis program.When NASA returns to the Moon, astronauts will travel to the Moon’s South Pole where lighting conditions will cause a more complex operational environment. Human-in-the-loop simulations play a crucial role in NASA’s mission planning, spacecraft and space systems development, and evaluation of operational scenarios. The development of immersive environments such as a lunar rover mockup at a video wall enables engineers and astronauts to simulate and experience mission scenarios, integrated spacecraft systems, and operational procedures in a relevant environment before deployment. By integrating realistic virtual environments, immersive technology allows for the visualization and interaction with virtual spacecraft models, mission landscapes, and complex operational tasks. This approach helps identify potential design flaws, operational challenges, and safety considerations. It also provides valuable insights for risk reduction and helps improve mission efficiency and effectiveness. With advanced motion tracking systems and custom virtual environments, data can be gathered and evaluated to help NASA refine training protocols, develop specialized training procedures, and optimize human-robotic interactions for future space missions. Furthermore, immersive technology offers opportunities for future training initiatives at NASA.The Virtual Reality Laboratory at JSC has pioneered training with Virtual Reality (VR) since the Hubble Space Telescope repair missions in the early 1990’s. Extended Reality (XR) simulations enable astronauts to rehearse complex spacewalks, spacecraft maneuvers, and extravehicular activities in a safe and controlled environment. By replicating the physical and cognitive challenges of space missions, immersive training experiences enhance astronauts’ situational awareness, decision-making abilities, and adaptability to unexpected scenarios. Additionally, immersive technology facilitates collaborative training, allowing geographically dispersed crew and mission control personnel to engage in synchronized simulations, fostering teamwork and effective communication.The adoption of immersive technology in NASA’s testing, evaluation, and future training programs has yielded significant benefits. By incorporating human-in-the-loop simulations for studies involving Extra Vehicular Activities (EVA), surface mobility and landing systems, NASA can identify and mitigate risks, optimize operational procedures, and enhance mission success. Ultimately, immersive simulation experiences can empower astronauts to better navigate the complexities of space missions, ensuring their safety, productivity, and success in the dynamic and challenging environments they will experience at the Lunar South Pole."
10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521425,Multi-Agent Autonomy for Space Exploration on the CADRE Lunar Technology Demonstration,"CADRE (Cooperative Autonomous Distributed Robotic Exploration) is a lunar technology demonstration mission of multi-agent autonomy on a team of three rovers and a base station. The mission is slated land at the Moon’s Reiner Gamma region as a CLPS (Commercial Lunar Payload Services) pay-load on the IM-3 mission in 2024. The goal of CADRE is to demonstrate how a team of autonomous rovers, receiving only high-level tasks from Earth, can autonomously explore a region of the Lunar surface, as well as perform a distributed measurement in coordination with a multi-static ground-penetrating radar. We envision that multi-agent autonomy will enable future missions to address hitherto-unanswered questions in planetary science on the Moon, Mars, and beyond. In this paper, we describe the autonomy architecture developed for CADRE, both for multi-agent coordination, and for single-agent driving surface mobility, and discuss the requirements and constraints that led to the selection of this architecture."
10.1109/AERO63441.2025.11068463,Robotics Capabilities Development for Mars Sample Return Transfer Activities,"The planned NASA-European Space Agency (ESA) Mars Sample Return campaign aims to be the first set of missions to bring Martian samples back to Earth, where thousands of scientists would make groundbreaking discoveries that could redefine our understanding of the Red Planet and perhaps even the origins of life on Earth. A crucial component of the circa 2023 baseline design for the missions was the transfer of sample tubes from the Martian surface to the ascent vehicle, which requires a highly dexterous robotic arm and sophisticated control strategies. Development and testing of the control algorithms were underway at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on advanced R&D testbeds, while the ESA is responsible for delivering the flight robotic arm. To meet the complex requirements for transferring the sample tubes, we propose an abstract layer consisting of three important robotics capabilities, each to be implemented for the first time in planetary exploration. 1. 7-DoF Manipulation: This capability focuses on managing the kinematics of the 7-DoF robotic arm. It includes the development of algorithms for forward and inverse kinematics, joint redundancy management, kinematic calibration, deflection compensation, target-to-pose selection, trajectory generation, and control strategies for single-joint, multi-joint, Cartesian motions, and free-space closed-loop control. 2. Robotics Vision: This capability pertains to a monocular vision system mounted on the robotic arm's end-effector with an additional redundant camera. These cameras are essential for localizing the Mars 2020 rover (M2020) tube-retrieval station, the SRL OS, identifying tubes on the Martian surface, and estimating the robotic arm's pose to ensure successful interactions with the station. 3. In-Contact Manipulation: This capability addresses the robot's interaction with its external environment. It involves load estimation using a 6-DoF force-torque sensor, force regulation (standard load-wrench control to a setpoint), and hybrid motion (force regulation orthogonal to a baseline velocity). This paper documents for posterity the infusion of these robotics capabilities, including the requirements, analysis, and testing processes that would have been necessary to ensure the success of the circa 2023 SRL Sample Transfer System design."
10.1109/AERO63441.2025.11068471,Progress in Planetary Protection Development for Crewed Mars Missions,"It is widely accepted that the current Planetary Protection (PP) paradigm developed for robotic spacecraft needs to change ahead of the first crewed mission to Mars. Assessing spacecraft microbial cleanliness against a quantitative bioburden threshold at launch is just not relevant for the habitable spacecraft environments that would be introduced to the Martian surface, when the astronauts themselves each have circa eight orders of magnitude more microorganisms on and in their bodies than would be permitted for a typical robotic Mars lander mission. The international COSPAR PP policy recognizes this, but also states that; “the intent of planetary protection is the same whether a mission to Mars is conducted robotically or with human explorers. Accordingly, planetary protection goals should not be relaxed to accommodate a human mission to Mars. Rather, they become even more directly relevant to such missions — even if specific implementation guidelines should differ.” The goals that are to remain the same (as described in Article IX of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty) are: i) to avoid the harmful contamination of the target solar system body (Mars in this case), and ii) to avoid adverse changes in the environment of the Earth resulting from the introduction of extraterrestrial matter. But what then are the implementation guidelines that should differ? The NASEM CoPP in its recent (2021) “Evaluation of Bioburden Requirements for Mars Missions” report declined to recommend relaxation of the present robotic requirements, noting that for such relaxation to be acceptable, any landing site needs “to be a conservative distance from any subsurface access point”, and that such a determination would also need to consider wind conditions for the location and season, and best estimates of microorganism survival time in the surface UV environment. This knowledge is simply not available at present, but this paper will provide an update on these and other “knowledge gaps” identified in a workshop series on PP for crewed Mars missions. Additionally, the paper will describe progress to incorporate the addressing of PP constraints in ongoing activities within NASA as the Moon to Mars architecture is matured. Finally, because the scientific community has been unable to provide a consensus answer to the question “How much is too much?”, in regard to the contamination that a crewed spacecraft mission might introduce to Mars, the paper will describe work to model and quantitate the microbial bioburden associated with the hardware and operations of NASA's crewed Mars surface mission concepts."
10.1109/AERO63441.2025.11068490,"Preliminary Design of the Robotic Pickup, Install, and Encapsulation Subsystem for CCRS","The Capture, Containment, and Return System (CCRS) aims to bring Martian rock and atmosphere samples to Earth as part of the planned Mars Sample Return (MSR) campaign. CCRS would consist of four key phases: (1) Launch, Commission, and Outbound Transfer, (2) Capture and Configuration of samples in Mars orbit, (3) On-Orbit Assembly of samples into Earth Entry Vehicle, (4) Protection, Jettison, and Release of the Earth Entry Vehicle (EEV). Under this architecture, the robotic (mechanical) functions during the On-Orbit Assembly phase were allocated to the Pickup, Install, and Encapsulation (PIE) subsystem. The subsystem relied on both hand calculations and ADAMS analysis to perform the multibody dynamic analysis associated with the required functions as part of establishing a preliminary design. Some key challenges entailed (a) interfaces driving system and hardware design, (b) configuration constraints (e.g. geometric, mass, resources - active vs passive), and (c) an aggressive schedule. This paper will describe the preliminary design of the subsystem as it pertains to the robotic functions, discuss key challenges and mitigations implemented, the multibody dynamics analysis, and the validation & verification plan. Note: any design information included here should be viewed as notional, as the CCRS project has been paused indefinitely while the MSR re-architecture efforts continue to respond to the findings of an independent review board. The information provided here reflects the project status at the end of its preliminary design review."
10.1109/AERO63441.2025.11068537,Software for the SpaceDREAM Robotic Arm,"Impedance-controlled robots are widely used on Earth to perform interaction-rich tasks and will be a key enabler for In-Space Servicing, Assembly and Manufacturing (ISAM) activities. This paper introduces the software architecture used on the On-Board Computer (OBC) for the planned Space-DREAM mission aiming to validate such robotic arm in Lower Earth Orbit (LEO) conducted by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in cooperation with KINETIK Space GmbH and the Technical University of Munich (TUM). During the mission several free motion as well as contact tasks are to be performed in order to verify proper functionality of the robot in position and impedance control on joint level as well as in cartesian control. The tasks are selected to be representative for subsequent servicing missions e.g. requiring interface docking or precise manipulation. The software on the OBC commands the robot's joints via SpaceWire to perform those mission tasks, reads camera images and data from additional sensors and sends telemetry data through an Ethernet link via the spacecraft down to Earth. It is set up to execute a predefined mission after receiving a start signal from the spacecraft while it should be extendable to receive commands from Earth for later missions. Core design principle was to reuse as much existing software and to stay as close as possible to existing robot software stacks at DLR. This allowed for a quick full operational start of the robot arm compared to a custom development of all robot software, a lower entry barrier for software developers as well as a reuse of existing libraries. While not every line of code can be tested with this design, most of the software has already proven its functionality through daily execution on multiple robot systems. The software stack is based on a real time Linux as operating system and the middleware “links and nodes” providing topic communication and service calls as well as process manager functionality. The actual mission software is partitioned into low-level real time control software consisting of a hardware abstraction layer providing telemetry from the robot's joints as well as validating and sending commands from a controller implemented in Simulink. Non-real time modules are responsible for parameterizing the controller and reading camera and other sensor data. A mission script orchestrates the individual tasks by commanding all software components. This mission script is also responsible for tracking subsystem health and potentially disabling erroneous subsystems and is itself monitored by the OBC's hardware watchdog. Finally, a data transmission program ensures prioritized telemetry data transfer to Earth via the spacecraft. Core components of this architecture have already been tested during the 42nd DLR parabolic flight campaign under micro gravity conditions proving their effectiveness and reliability. The detailed software architecture, design choices and software tests will be described in the remainder of the paper."
10.1109/AERO63441.2025.11068585,Prototyping Cooperative Radio Navigation for Planetary Exploration with Software-Defined Radios,"Reliable radio communications as well as position, navigation and timing (PNT) are crucial for planetary exploration missions. Prototyping, experiments and analogue missions are vital to increase the technology readiness level (TRL). Software-defined radios (SDRs) are perfectly suited for such tasks due to their flexibility and comparably low implementation effort. With the this paper, we introduce a software architecture for cooperative radio navigation, which can be adapted for different experiments and hardware setups. We showcase three measurements and experiments in analogue environments with distinct requirements. First, we show how accurate time-of-flight (ToF) measurements can be achieved with single-channel SDRs and present radio channel and ranging measurements inside a lava tube. Second, we introduce a coherent multi-channel SDR setup for direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation and demonstrate cooperative radio navigation of robotic rovers on a volcano. Third, we present a two-channel SDR for hybrid lunar navigation, capable of simultaneously performing ranging with neighboring nodes and receiving satellite navigation signals. We conclude that, with careful setup and calibration, SDRs are well suited to develop flexible and accurate radio navigation systems."

10.1109/AIITA65135.2025.11047706,Mitigation Multi-Path Inference on Reflective Floor using Neural Network,"Multi-path interference (MPI) is a significant challenge in time-of-flight (ToF) sensing, particularly on specular surfaces such as reflective floors, leading to substantial depth measurement errors. This paper presents a novel approach to mitigating MPI effects using a combination of precise sensor calibration, a robust data acquisition pipeline, and a deep learning-based correction model. We employ an industrial-grade iToF camera to capture input data and a high-precision5 laser scanner for ground truth generation, ensuring accurate MPI characterization. A hybrid correction strategy is proposed, incorporating geometric plane fitting and a lightweight neural network trained on a combination of real-world and synthetic datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces MPI-induced depth errors from approximately 33.5 cm to 4.2 cm (∼87% reduction). The trained model is optimized for real-time inference on embedded hardware, achieving an inference time of 18 ms on GPU.

10.1109/AIM52237.2022.9863321,Robotic precision 3D measurements in vibration-prone environments enabled by active six DoF sample-tracking,"This paper presents a six degree of freedom (DoF) active sample-tracking robotic 3D measurement system for inline applications. The integrated measurement platform (MP) of the state-of-the-art system is augmented by a compact and tailored in-plane tracking sensor system. Based on two position-sensitive devices and laser markers, relative motion between the 3D measuring tool on the MP and a sample surface is measured with sub-micrometer resolution. Applying a tailored high performance PID control architecture, a six DoF sample-tracking control bandwidth of about 450 Hz is achieved. In a translational in-plane DoF, vibrations with a dominant component at 66 Hz are reduced from 9.44µm rms by a factor of 10 to 931 nm rms. Experimental results successfully proof the system concept of robotic 3D measurements with sub-micrometer precision directly in a challenging vibration-prone environment."
10.1109/AIM55361.2024.10636988,Hybrid-AI Grasp Planning System that Integrates Rule-Based and DNN-Based Methods for Throughput Improvement of Picking Robots,"In the logistics field, due to the declining birthrate, aging population, and shrinking workforce, there is growing demand for automation of manual handling tasks. Focusing on robotic picking operations, we developed two grasping methods for various items: rule-based grasp planning that considers the physical characteristics of the items and environment, and DNN-based grasp planning that can learn the grasping points obtained by the same method. Rule-based grasp planning is computationally time-consuming, and DNN-based grasp planning has a lower success rate. Therefore, this paper proposes hybrid-AI grasp planning that integrates these grasp planning methods. We effectively demonstrated that selecting an appropriate grasp planning method by the developed selector can improve throughput because it can combine a high success rate with fast calculation time."

To address this, we propose a modular resilient robot designed to autonomously recover functionality following partial damage. MR-Robot features a novel ""key-lock"" docking mechanism implemented via male and female connectors, with the female connector incorporating a multilayer structure that supports docking, locking, disassembly, and joint mode switching. This architecture enables seamless transitions between full actuation and under-actuation modes. A kinematic model is developed and an inverse kinematics solution is formulated to support precise motion planning. To minimize wiring complexity and enhance scalability, a lightweight MQTT-based communication protocol is adopted for intermodule data exchange. Furthermore, closed-loop control using a PID algorithm ensures accurate joint positioning. A functional prototype has been developed to validate the proposed design.

10.1109/AIoTSys63104.2024.10780738,Doodbot: A Human-Machine Chess-Playing System Based on Edge-Assisted Manipulator,"Manipulators have been widely adopted in realistic scenarios like industrial manufacturing, given their many degrees of freedom and extendability. However, under non-ideal environments, the autonomous human-machine interaction of manipulators is still a challenging problem. Moreover, despite numerous advanced methods for environmental perception and planning control, deploying these intricate methods directly to manipulators with limited resources remains difficult. This paper proposes Doodbot, an edge computing assisted manipulator system for human-machine chess-playing. Under the hood, Doodbot makes a geometric model for the manipulator and adopts a model predictive control method to realize the rolling optimal control of the manipulator. Furthermore, Doodbot deploys a hybrid chess-board recognition algorithm combining traditional line detection and convolutional neural network-based image recognition, thus enjoying both the adaptiveness of the conventional method and the high recognition performance of the deep neural network. These computing tasks are offloaded to an edge node in proximity for computing capability augmentation, avoiding long-delayed execution on resource-limited manipulators. The feasibility and robustness of Doodbot are verified through realistic prototype system implementation. The experimental results show that Doodbot has improved the accuracy of chessboard perception by up to 31%. In addition, it can also correctly plan the motion trajectory of the robotic arm and reduce control errors by 36%. A video demo of Doodbot on a real robotic arm can be found on https://ykqm.jyen.top/index.php/s/9q2qH4RajdDffPB."

Consequently, it is required to alter the current network design. SDN is a well-liked architecture because it offers customizable control and centralized management in data centers. To achieve scalability and dependability, it was necessary to propose the geographical dispersal of a logically centralized control plane due to the huge scale of networks. Software-defined networking (SDN) load-balancing optimization has been studied for a long time. Many approaches to the load-balancing conundrum have been put forth by researchers, but very few have taken the impact of transmission delay between controllers and switches under heavy network load into account. In this article we elaborate the various techniques of load balancing in SDN those working on different areas like multi-controller, switch migration, multi-agent, strategy, time sharing, prediction, reinforcement learning etc. We discuss the methods used along with the advantages and disadvantages of various costs, service quality, and network performance metrics."

10.1109/APCC62576.2024.10767961,A QoS-aware Handover Mechanism for LEO Satellite Networks Based on Multi-agent DRL,"In future space-ground integrated networks, a satellite-based core network can reduce frequent signaling interactions between satellites and ground stations, thereby enhancing network architecture and supporting global communications. Users can achieve end-to-end communication through the satellitebased User Plane Function (UPF). However, the high dynamics of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites result in frequent inter-satellite handovers, significantly affecting user service continuity. Existing satellite handover strategies are overly simplistic and fail to ensure the Quality of Service (QoS). Additionally, ground users compete for satellite links based on limited observations, leading to network congestion. This paper proposes a loadbalanced, distributed, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning method for satellite handover. We formulate a combinatorial optimization problem to maximize the total utility of user-satellite associations across various service types. Each user acts based on local information and engages in distributed matching with satellites. Simulation results indicate that our method ensures QoS for various service types, optimizes load balancing, and outperforms basic handover strategies in terms of handover success rate and frequency."

Accurately forecasting pedestrian movements in dynamic and crowded environments is challenging due to factors such as unpredictable motion patterns, occlusions, missed detections, and identity switches. In this paper, we explore deep learning-based approaches for multi-frame pedestrian trajectory prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network–GRU (CNN-GRU) model. Although the CNN-GRU architecture is a known combination, our contribution lies in its practical deployment on detection- and tracking-based trajectories, generated using BoT-SORT tracking over YOLOv11 detections, and its comprehensive evaluation across three challenging benchmark datasets: MOT16, MOT17, and MOT20. The models take past trajectory sequences as input and predict future pedestrian positions, with performance measured using Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE). Experimental results demonstrate that the CNN-GRU model outperforms standalone recurrent models by effectively capturing spatial and temporal dependencies while remaining computationally efficient and suitable for real-time applications. This study provides valuable insights into practical deep learning-based pedestrian trajectory prediction, emphasizing robustness under realistic tracking conditions and its potential impact on pedestrian safety and traffic management in smart city environments."

In this method, an initial path is first planned to create waypoints via the point cloud. The method estimates the contact area to dynamically adjust initial path points to ensure uniform trajectory coverage on the surface. In this paper, the bilateral tool path generation (BTPG) algorithm is proposed based on a dual-thread strategy to expedite polishing path generation. Further, we introduce a method that generates smooth postures to enhance the stability of the robotic polishing pose. In this work, hybrid force/velocity control scheme is adopted to track polishing path and apply the assigned force on the workpiece freeform surface.

While current research primarily focuses on autonomously controlling rigid robots, establishing control models for flexible robots remains challenging. To address this, model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) presents a promising approach for enabling agents to make decisions under uncertainty. In this paper, we investigate the control policy of a flexible endoscope using Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA) platform. We design a flexible tendon-driven robotic endoscope (TDRE) and develop a custom simulation environment within SOFA to train DRL agents. Our approach involves implementing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to approximate an optimal policy for trajectory planning. The optimal policy facilitates trajectory tracking tasks for the TDRE’s end-effector, such as circle trajectories and action disturbances, without requiring fine-tuning policy network parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves near real-time performance (30 FPS). The feedforward neural network of the policy provides feedback, enabling closed-loop control of TDRE. Furthermore, our experiments show that the navigation success rate of TDRE exceeds 90% within a tolerant error of 3 mm in free space. Notably, compared to direct training with contact, navigation tasks with contact retrained by a pre-trained policy in free space exhibit enhanced navigation capabilities."
10.1109/BCCA66705.2025.11229637,A Framework for Embedding Generative and Agentic AI in Open Source Intelligence,"Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) plays a critical role in cybersecurity and threat intelligence. However, traditional methods are slow, manual, and difficult to scale. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI have been explored for OSINT, most existing approaches apply them to isolated tasks without developing an integrated and autonomous architecture. This paper proposes a novel Agentic AI-driven OSINT framework that enables autonomous information gathering, reasoning, and tool orchestration across heterogeneous open-source data streams. The system uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive agent planning to determine which tools to invoke, how to process intermediate outputs, and when to escalate findings for human review. The proposed architecture includes modules for multi-source data ingestion, LLM-powered analysis, generative scenario simulation, and ethical safeguard enforcement. A proof-of-concept use case involving the location of missing persons from public data demonstrates how the framework improves coverage, accuracy, and decision speed when compared to conventional OSINT workflows. This work introduces the first unified and reproducible design for an Agentic AI OSINT system that incorporates transparency, accountability, and ethical compliance into its operational core."
10.1109/BIBM62325.2024.10822109,ArgMed-Agents: Explainable Clinical Decision Reasoning with LLM Disscusion via Argumentation Schemes,"There are two main barriers to using large language models (LLMs) in clinical reasoning. Firstly, while LLMs exhibit significant promise in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their performance in complex reasoning and planning falls short of expectations. Secondly, LLMs use uninterpretable methods to make clinical decisions that are fundamentally different from the clinician’s cognitive processes. This leads to user distrust. In this paper, we present a multi-agent framework called ArgMed-Agents, which aims to enable LLM-based agents to make explainable clinical decision reasoning through interaction. ArgMed-Agents performs self-argumentation iterations via Argumentation Scheme for Clinical Discussion (a reasoning mechanism for modeling cognitive processes in clinical reasoning), and then constructs the argumentation process as a directed graph representing conflicting relationships. Ultimately, use symbolic solver to identify a series of rational and coherent arguments to support decision. We construct a formal model of ArgMed-Agents and present conjectures for theoretical guarantees. ArgMed-Agents enables LLMs to mimic the process of clinical argumentative reasoning by generating explanations of reasoning in a self-directed manner. The setup experiments show that ArgMed-Agents not only improves accuracy in complex clinical decision reasoning problems compared to other prompt methods, but more importantly, it provides users with decision explanations that increase their confidence."
10.1109/BIBM62325.2024.10822186,MedGen: An Explainable Multi-Agent Architecture for Clinical Decision Support through Multisource Knowledge Fusion,"Agents in medical decision support have been extensively researched, particularly in areas like evidence support, multimorbidity management, and patient-specific needs. However, current approaches lack a unified method to address real-time evidence updates, manage multiple diseases independently, and incorporate personalized patient needs. Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agents are limited by their reliance on static knowledge bases, hindering their ability to promptly update clinical guidelines and meet diverse patient requirements. Moreover, the interpretability of LLMs remains a significant concern, leading to skepticism in their medical application. To address these challenges, we developed MedGen, a multi-agent architecture that decomposes the clinical decision-making process into stages such as clinical goal setting, data collection, argumentation linking, and plan selection. This structured approach allows LLM agents to provide both reasoning evidence and a transparent reasoning process, enhancing the reliability and interpretability of outcomes. Finally, a case study of breast cancer and depression is combined to illustrate our architecture."
10.1109/BioRob49111.2020.9224441,Networks of Place Cells for Representing 3D Environments and Path Planning,"Conventional methods for motion control and path planning in robots are nowhere near as reactive and flexible as in nature. Brains solve navigation using place cells - neurons that provide a cognitive representation of a specific environment. Neural techniques for path planning in 2D have been developed for years, however, to allow their application for robotic tasks beyond locomotion, a transmission to 3D is required. We present an implementation for path planning via a propagating wavefront on 3D environments. The algorithm operates on a Spiking Neural Network of excitatory place cells structured as a grid. A wavefront travelling through the network is initiated by activating the goal place cell. The wave strengthens synapses in the direction of the propagation using STDP, as a synaptic learning rule. By interpreting the synaptic weights as a vector field, a path can be derived from any place cell, reached by the wave, to the destination. We demonstrate, using a neural simulator, that our algorithm works well on maps with multiple obstacles. Our method allows fast simulation and query times and we expect to considerably improve the network creation time by using dedicated hardware, allowing massive parallelism. Our algorithm applies bio-inspired techniques and is especially interesting for Human-robot interaction, which requires reactive flexible motion planning."

High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) on the other hand allows for a completely remote and concentrated delivery of energy to a target location without the need for direct access and is particularly well suited to be robotically guided and thus used as part of an autonomous system. While robotic HIFU devices have been extensively explored for extracorporeal applications, their application into a laparoscopic setting is still widely unexplored. This paper presents a novel robotic HIFU pick-up device along with an automated workflow that includes the autonomous acquisition of the tumor geometry via Ultrasound (US) imaging, trajectory planning and autonomous execution of the HIFU ablation constraint by the tissue surface. Therefore, a novel sensorised water-filled membrane is developed and evaluated, enabling hybrid force position control that allows for minimising interaction forces with the tissue surface while maintaining sufficient acoustic coupling for ablation. Experiments on a phantom with a HIFU probe dummy demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in targeting hidden structures."
10.1109/CAC51589.2020.9327261,Optimal Multi-Agent Map Coverage Path Planning Algorithm,"Multi-agent path planning is one of the important research directions of multi-agent cooperative control, among which multi-agent covering path planning (mCPP) is a hot topic at present. Nowadays, many researchers have put forward relevant algorithms, but in some specific cases, problems such as low success rate of planning and low computational efficiency have appeared. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm based on the combination of the initial position partitioning algorithm and Two-pass algorithm is proposed for map pre-scanning and map full coverage path planning. Before the coverage path planning, this algorithm firstly scans the complex environment, calculates an evaluation coefficient, then divides the map according to the initial position of multiple agents, and finally carries out path planning in each area to complete the map's full coverage path planning. Compared with the traditional method, the designed algorithm can prescan the map without dividing the region through multiple iterations, which has higher computing efficiency and solves the shortcoming of low success rate of the traditional algorithm under special circumstances. It ensures the security, integrity and robustness of covering path planning without collision of multiple agents."

The traditional analysis model based on mechanism modeling is difficult to deal with the cognitive problem of multi-agent complex system. In view of the safe and stable operation of power grids in some regions after access to massive distributed flexible resources such as reverse transmission, overvoltage, and difficulty in peak regulation, it is urgent to study the refined cognition of power grid operation situation and the abductive technology of risk assessment based on probability statistical analysis and deep learning, so as to improve the cognition level and control ability of power grid risk.

Most traditional path-planning methods rely on prior map information and perform poorly in complex, map-less scenarios with multiple moving obstacles and randomized goal positions. Although reinforcement learning can partially address these issues, it still suffers from sparse rewards and low sample efficiency. In this paper, we propose a hybrid navigation framework that integrates velocity obstacles (VO) priors with soft actor-critic (SAC) reinforcement learning to enhance training sample efficiency and convergence speed. At the same time, we leverage the dynamic window approach (DWA) to assist in reward function design, alleviating sparse-reward problems, and employ curriculum learning to guide the agent from simple to complex tasks. We validate our approach in the PyBullet simulation environment, and results show that, compared to both traditional reinforcement learning and classical path-planning algorithms, our method delivers significant improvements in safety, efficiency, and robustness."

10.1109/CASE48305.2020.9216872,Data-Driven Hierarchical Predictive Learning in Unknown Environments,"We propose a hierarchical learning architecture for predictive control in unknown environments. We consider a constrained nonlinear dynamical system and assume the availability of state-input trajectories solving control tasks in different environments. A parameterized environment model generates state constraints specific to each task, which are satisfied by the stored trajectories. Our goal is to find a feasible trajectory for a new task in an unknown environment. From stored data, we learn strategies in the form of target sets in a reduced-order state space. These strategies are applied to the new task in real-time using a local forecast of the new environment, and the resulting output is used as a terminal region by a low-level receding horizon controller. We show how to i) design the target sets from past data and then ii) incorporate them into a model predictive control scheme with shifting horizon that ensures safety of the closed-loop system when performing the new task.

The composition of omega-3 fatty acids in salmon fat is a critical food quality indicator for the salmon farming industry, as a high content contributes to a redder fillet and fewer unwanted dark spots and, consequently, leads to a higher price tag. Nowadays, Raman spectroscopy is conducted manually using a commercial all-in-one Raman system for rapid measurements in a laboratory or close to the production line. In general, this activity can be tedious, error-prone, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. To address such challenges, we propose an autonomous robotic Raman spectroscopy system synergized with a computer vision system, an AI-based learning approach, and a motion planning algorithm. We then developed a proof-of-concept demo using a Raman sensor mounted ad-hoc on a 6-DoF robot arm, an RGB-D camera, a conveyor system, and printed/natural salmon fillets, emulating a lab-scale industrial environment. All software architecture is implemented using the ROS framework and open-source Python libraries.

Recent advances in robotic manipulation hold the potential to automate the tying process, yet face challenges in accurately estimating tying poses in congested rebar nodes. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid perception and motion planning approach that integrates geometry-based perception with Equivariant Denoising Diffusion on SE(3) (Diffusion-EDFs) to enable robust multi-node rebar tying with minimal training data. Our perception module utilizes density-based clustering (DBSCAN), geometry-based node feature extraction, and principal component analysis (PCA) to segment rebar bars, identify rebar nodes, and estimate orientation vectors for sequential ranking, even in complex, unstructured environments. The motion planner, based on Diffusion-EDFs, is trained on as few as 5–10 demonstrations to generate sequential end-effector poses that optimize collision avoidance and tying efficiency. The proposed system is validated on various rebar meshes, including single-layer, multi-layer, and cluttered configurations, demonstrating high success rates in node detection and accurate sequential tying. Compared with conventional approaches that rely on large datasets or extensive manual parameter tuning, our method achieves robust, efficient, and adaptable multi-node tying while significantly reducing data requirements.

The architecture consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) that extracts adequate features from local perception, a Graph Sample and AggreGate (GraphSAGE) that fuses the features among agents, and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) that decodes the output of GraphSAGE into action primitives. We trained the combined neural networks and tested them, the overall efficacy of the presented method was comprehensively evaluated by multiple simulation results in an unknown environment."

All these resources and the subjacent information flows should be coordinated and integrated to ensure an effective disassembly process. In this paper, we present a developed architecture for closed-loop planning and controlling dynamic disassembly processes of robots. We extended the infrastructure provided by the Robot Operating System (ROS) to integrate the components of the robotic system with its vision system and the software components for inference, replanning, and knowledge transfer. The architecture was implemented for a real use case of antenna amplifier disassembly. The implemented framework is generalizable for other purposes implementing four automatic configuration mechanisms to support domain-specific tailoring: code generation, object serialization, object mapping, and object-triple mapping."

The industry trend of growing product diversity and individual customization requires fully automatic and flexible production systems. In this work, an automatic workflow to execute a drawing process on a 3D object from a user-provided 2D input pattern is presented. The workflow involves a mesh segmentation, a flattening algorithm using least-squares conformal mappings and a projection using barycentric coordinates.

This paper outlines a methodology to execute a sequence of actions for a smart satellite equipped with a robotic manipulator to autonomously assemble to a passive module, creating a more capable satellite. This paper showcases a demonstration of this methodology at an Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) ground-based test facility, the Robotic Orbital Control (ROC) lab. The testbed at this facility includes two hexagonal float craft suspended by air bearings on top of a granite table, with the ability to move without friction. These modular robotic craft are equipped with docking adapters and a robotic arm.

We used actor-critic architecture with convolutional layers to learn an agent's policy from simulated limited-range sensor observations. We experimented with different reward functions and network architectures to get a minimal repetition rate. Our results show that model generalizes well to unseen environments with complex geometry and dynamic obstacles and demonstrates the ability to learn some optimal trajectory patterns like circular and boustrophedon motion. An approach may as well be suitable for a multi-agent setting with minor adjustments, as shown by our simulations."
10.1109/CDC45484.2021.9683506,iLQR for Piecewise-Smooth Hybrid Dynamical Systems,"Trajectory optimization is a popular strategy for planning trajectories for robotic systems. However, many robotic tasks require changing contact conditions, which is difficult due to the hybrid nature of the dynamics. The optimal sequence and timing of these modes are typically not known ahead of time. In this work, we extend the Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) method to a class of piecewise-smooth hybrid dynamical systems with state jumps by allowing for changing hybrid modes in the forward pass, using the saltation matrix to update the gradient information in the backwards pass, and using a reference extension to account for mode mismatch. We demonstrate these changes on a variety of hybrid systems and compare the different strategies for computing the gradients."
10.1109/CDC45484.2021.9683761,Bounded Rational RRT-QX: Multi-Agent Motion Planning in Dynamic Human-Like Environments Using Cognitive Hierarchy and Q-Learning,This paper presents a multi-agent motion planning algorithm for human-like navigation in dynamic environments. A cognitive hierarchy approach is used to model the motion of autonomous agents. We discuss potential levels of rationality and introduce a method to predict them in real-time. The rationality level prediction is achieved by observing the kinody-namic distance (KD) of other agents. An offline training phase is required to learn the maximum KD from multiple boundary value problems. Collision avoidance is ensured by introducing artificial obstacles in the environment based on the predicted levels of rationality. The motion planning is then carried out using RRT-QX. The effectiveness of the bounded rational motion planning algorithm is illustrated in simulations.
10.1109/CDC49753.2023.10383438,Multi-Agent Reach-Avoid Games: Two Attackers Versus One Defender and Mixed Integer Programming,"We propose a hybrid approach that combines Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability and mixed-integer optimization for solving a reach-avoid game with multiple attackers and defenders. The reach-avoid game is an important problem with potential applications in air traffic control and multi-agent motion planning; however, solving this game for many attackers and defenders is intractable due to the adversarial nature of the agents and the high problem dimensionality. In this paper, we first propose an HJ reachability-based method for solving the reach-avoid game in which 2 attackers are playing against 1 defender; we derive the numerically convergent optimal winning sets for the two sides in environments with obstacles. Utilizing this result and previous results for the 1 vs. 1 game, we further propose solving the general multi-agent reach-avoid game by determining the defender assignments that can maximize the number of attackers captured via a Mixed Integer Program (MIP). Our method generalizes previous state-of-the-art results and is especially useful when there are fewer defenders than attackers. We validate our theoretical results in numerical simulations."
10.1109/CDC49753.2023.10383600,CaRT: Certified Safety and Robust Tracking in Learning-Based Motion Planning for Multi-Agent Systems,"The key innovation of our analytical method, CaRT, lies in establishing a new hierarchical, distributed architecture to guarantee the safety and robustness of a given learning-based motion planning policy. First, in a nominal setting, the analytical form of our CaRT safety filter formally ensures safe maneuvers of nonlinear multi-agent systems, optimally with minimal deviation from the learning-based policy. Second, in off-nominal settings, the analytical form of our CaRT robust filter optimally tracks the certified safe trajectory, generated by the previous layer in the hierarchy, the CaRT safety filter. We show using contraction theory that CaRT guarantees safety and the exponential boundedness of the trajectory tracking error, even under the presence of deterministic and stochastic disturbance. Also, the hierarchical nature of CaRT enables enhancing its robustness for safety just by its superior tracking to the certified safe trajectory, thereby making it suitable for off-nominal scenarios with large disturbances. This is a major distinction from conventional safety function-driven approaches, where the robustness originates from the stability of a safe set, which could pull the system over-conservatively to the interior of the safe set. Our log-barrier formulation in CaRT allows for its distributed implementation in multi-agent settings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CaRT in several examples of nonlinear motion planning and control problems, including optimal, multi-spacecraft reconfiguration."

Drawing inspiration from biological navigation, the CM model integrates elements like landmarks, Euclidean distance, exploratory movement, and reward-driven actions. Key features of the model include types of cognitive mapping cells designed to replicate their biological functions in a computationally efficient manner. Built on cognitive map concepts used to explain mammalian navigation, this CM model enables robots to navigate complex environments without needing complete environmental exploration. Additionally, an enhanced ℬ-spline curve scheme ensures a smoother, safer trajectory. After planning a global route, the model utilizes a histogram-based local navigation algorithm to dynamically avoid obstacles while creating real-time maps as the robot follows its path.

10.1109/CMSDA58069.2022.00021,Air Combat Modeling Based on DE+FSM+CT Architecture,"Combat modeling is important for simulating real combat scenarios and assisting commanders to optimize the combat plan. In this paper, we propose a combat modeling and simulation system based on DE+FSM+CT architecture for the air defense scenario. Generally, a combat situation can be viewed as a discrete event system exchanging signals and physical interactions between subsystems. Following the DEVS formalism, we develop the system with 3 types of models including the entity model, action model and damage model, which model the combat subjects, combat actions and combat effects respectively. The basic modeling unit of the system is a native model, which is an agent designed based on the DE+FSM+CT architecture. Each agent has independent internal structure, behavior and explicit input/output interfaces, achieving the modeling of combat actions. Multiple agents are connected hierarchically into a coupled multi-agent model to achieve hierarchical modeling of the continuous time system and discrete event system for combat scenario. We experiment by taking different combat plans as input, and show the simulation results. According to the results, we can easily select the optimal combat plan. The experimental results show the superiority of the DE+FSM+CT architecture for combat modeling and simulationeffectively."
10.1109/CoDIT58514.2023.10284283,Adaptive NMPC-RBF with Application to Manipulator Robots,"Control algorithms must deal with model uncertainties and disturbances, making them perfect for real-world applications. In addition, increased computational power in the industrial field allows the implementation of advanced control algorithms such as nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), which is an optimal control scheme that includes system and control constraints imposed by robot dynamics and the environment. Nevertheless, modeling the robot and its environment is a complicated task due to high nonlinearities, such as model uncertainties in the form of complex unmodeled dynamics, varying payloads, and parameter mismatch, leading to fast degradation of NMPC; therefore, online adaptation laws that improve the performance even in unknown environments are needed. Due to the facts presented before, this work combines the universal approximation of RBFNN and the optimality offered by NMPC in a unified adaptive framework that guarantees good performance even under uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics. The proposed framework is tested in simulation using a 2-link planar robotic arm (SCARA Bosch SR-800), where optimization techniques were used to identify the robot's dynamics. Finally, a comparison of the proposed architecture with a baseline nominal NMPC is made with particular attention to trajectory tracking performance, demonstrating the reduction of the tracking error over non-adaptive NMPC."
10.1109/CoDIT58514.2023.10284509,CloverNet: A Real-Time Network for Semantic Segmentation Onboard Edge Devices Towards Planetary Exploration,"This paper introduces CloverNet, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for real-time semantic segmentation capabilities onboard planetary exploration rovers. Teleoperating planetary rovers is a tedious task as it requires close to real-time monitoring and planning, while distance and communication delay further cripple the efficiency. Future up-scaling of off-world robotic systems deployment makes it increasingly difficult to monitor and command each agent in real-time. Thus, at least an autonomous maneuvering capability is essential to reduce the operational workload at the ground station. In order to achieve this objective, the rover is required to understand its operational environment. The rover then needs to process the information at real-time and efficiently respond in order to complete the allocated tasks or to recover from hazards. An innovative CNN for real-time semantic segmentation is proposed, which can be run on limited memory and graphics processing unit (GPU). The solution is benchmarked on an RGB-D visual sensor and on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier mounted on a skid-steering micro-rover platform. CloverNet consists of a light encoder-decoder architecture that is optimized and quantized using the NVIDIA TensorRT framework, enabling it to operate at high frame rate and low GPU latency. The network is trained using a new data set curated for developing semantic segmentation of rocks and rovers belonging to Lunar and Martian analogue environments. Experimental results showed it can reach high performance in terms of accuracy and intersection over the union, as well as achieving a maximum inference speed of ∼ 55 FPS on a GPU board at the edge. As such, the results prove CloverNet suitable for planetary missions."
10.1109/CogMI62246.2024.00032,Optimizing Human-Robot Collaboration in Industry 5.0: A Comparative Study of Communication Mediums and Their Impact on Worker Well-being and Productivity,"As manufacturing environments transition towards Industry 5.0 paradigms and incorporate human-robot collaborative activities, investigating optimal communication strategies between human workers and robotic assistants is critical. Smooth coordination through communicating needs, plans, and actions is essential for effective teamwork. However, the impacts of different communication mediums on human factors and assembly cycle time in these hybrid teams remain in initial research stages. While direct physical communication channels, like buttons, allow for communicating the needs of a collaborative human partner, this active medium may increase operator workload and stress. In contrast, indirect visual mediums where robots interpret human behavior may reduce active control demands. Evaluating communication effects is critical as Industry 5.0 aims to improve human well-being by facilitating closer human-machine cooperation. This study compared active, direct communication through physical buttons with passive, indirect communication visually through AI-based robot observation and decision-making. 50 participants completed an assembly task across three conditions: no robot assistance, robot assistance via a direct physical medium, and assistance via an indirect visual medium (AI observing and deciding robot actions). Mental workload and stress were assessed using heart rate variability and reaction times. Assembly cycle times were manually recorded. Results showed a 17% reduction in subjective mental workload with the visual communication medium compared to manual assembly for 64% of participants. HRV analysis indicated lower stress levels in both collaborative conditions compared to manual assembly, with the physical button interface showing the lowest stress levels overall. Assembly times averaged 5% faster with AI-controlled visual communication versus direct button control. These results suggest AI-enabled visual communication better optimizes human wellbeing and productivity, which could play a key role for Industry 5.0 goals in transitioning towards closer and more harmonious human-robot collaboration."
10.1109/CogSIMA64436.2025.11079504,Innate-Values-Driven Reinforcement Learning Based Cooperative Multi-Agent Cognitive Modeling,"In multi-agent systems (MAS), the dynamic interaction among multiple decision-makers is driven by their innate values, affecting the environment's state, and can cause specific behavioral patterns to emerge. On the other hand, innate values in cognitive modeling reflect individual interests and preferences for specific tasks and drive them to develop diverse skills and plans, satisfying their various needs and achieving common goals in cooperation. Therefore, building the awareness of AI agents to balance the group utilities and system costs and meet group members' needs in their cooperation is a crucial problem for individuals learning to support their community and even integrate into human society in the long term. However, the current MAS reinforcement learning domain lacks a general intrinsic model to describe agents' dynamic motivation for decision-making and learning from an individual needs perspective in their cooperation. To address the gap, this paper proposes a general MAS innate-values reinforcement learning (IVRL) architecture from the individual preferences angle. We tested the Multi-Agent IVRL Actor-Critic Model in different StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) settings, which demonstrated its potential to organize the group's behaviours to achieve better performance."

It is therefore necessary to create a methodology to assess robot fleet failure rates to reduce the requirement for costly human intervention. A solution to this problem includes robots with the ability to work together symbiotically to overcome mission resilience challenges. However, robotic platforms generally lack built-in interconnectivity with other platforms from different vendors. This work aims to tackle this issue by enabling the functionality through a bidirectional digital twin. The twin enables the human operator to transmit and receive information to and from the heterogeneous multi-robot fleet. This digital twin considers autonomy for mission resilience and human-led decision making to enable the resilience of a multi-robot fleet. Decision-making within the digital twin triggers the symbiotic digital architecture to preserve mission continuity via adaptive planning in the robotic team. This creates the cooperation, corroboration, and collaboration of diverse robots to leverage the capability via a multi robot fleet, supporting the recovery of a failed robot. This research enables for robots to overcome resilience issues ahead of the requirement for human intervention."

One of the perspective new classes of Enterprise 5.0 systems is Autonomous Resource Management Systems (ARMS), based on models, methods and algorithms for collective decision-making, ontologies and multi-agent technologies. The platform is based on the concept of Emergent Intelligence (EI), inspired by theory of complex adaptive systems, based on self-organization processes with non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The fundamentals, functionality and architecture of the developed EI platform are discussed. The core functionality of ARMS is to make adaptive resources allocation, planning and optimization, combined with monitoring and control of resources in real time.

This study proposes an Adaptive Mutation-based Differential Evolution-enhanced Double-Layer Deep Reinforcement Learning (AMSDE-DL-DRL) framework to address collaborative task scheduling for multiple UAVs in fire emergency scenarios. The framework employs a hierarchical architecture that decouples task allocation and path planning: an upper-layer encoder-decoder policy network handles multi-UAV task allocation, while a differential evolution-optimized attention network in the lower layer conducts single-UAV path planning under maximum flight distance constraints to maximize executed tasks. An Interactive Training Strategy (ITS) integrating pretraining, reinforcement training, and alternating phases optimizes training efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that AMSDE-DL-DRL significantly outperforms OR-Tools in task completion rate and maintains robust generalization at hundred-task scales, with ablation studies confirming its effectiveness in balancing performance and training efficiency. This approach provides a novel solution for large-scale dynamic multi-agent collaboration challenges."
10.1109/COMPSAC61105.2024.00013,Verifying Multi -Agent Coordination Correctness for BDI Agents,"The popular Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) architecture structures agents' behavior around beliefs, desires, and intentions, enabling effective pursuit of collective objectives and optimal system performance. Many complex situations require agent developers to design a coordination model/plan involving multiple BDI agents working together to achieve a given goal. However, a semantic notion of state has been missing in most current accounts of BDI agent execution, making it impossible to assess at design time if a coordination model/plan is able to achieve the goal. Thus, in this paper, we introduce a framework that permits us to identify the state that accrues at any point in agent execution. This enables us to determine, at design time, if a multi-agent coordination model/plan accomplishes a given goal. Our framework facilitates the verification of coordination correctness in such complex multi-agent systems."

However, translating open-ended instructions into granular action plans for robotic systems remains a challenge. This paper proposes a self-supervised learning framework that enables an embodied multi-modal agent to comprehensively understand and perform tasks based on complex natural language interactions. The methodology focuses on an agentic workflow and self-refinement process, where the LLM actively engages in the task-solving process by generating its own problems, decomposing them, and refining the solutions through iterative self-feedback. The proposed methodology is evaluated on a maze navigation task, where an agent must extract sub-tasks from natural language instructions and navigate a grid while satisfying constraints. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in solving problems with multiple sub-tasks. Such capabilities could transform human-computer interaction and automated decision support."

10.1109/CSCN67557.2025.11230734,Toward Intelligent Bandwidth Prioritization in Distributed 6G ISAC: An Agentic AI Perspective,"Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a cornerstone of sixth-generation (6G) networks that is designed to offer situational awareness in real-time and intelligent coordination across increasingly sophisticated IoT environments. Yet, most existing ISAC systems are still not effective in dynamic environments, especially where semantic relevance, bandwidth-limited environments, and asynchronous data streams require adaptive, intelligent decision-making. This work provides a distributed ISAC framework integrating Agentic Artificial Intelligence (Agentic AI) with a Semantic-aware Asynchronous Federated Learning (S3A-AFL) architecture. The framework empowers edge agents to make timely context-aware decisions to dynamically allocate bandwidth, adjust sensing plans, and trigger model updates only when necessary, rather than employing pre-fixed schedules. By semantic encoding and distributed learning, S3A-AFL evades regular synchronization needs, enabling efficient performance in realistic scenarios. Compared to a static baseline, approach achieves a 32% improvement in average latency and an 18% reduction in packet loss, proving the benefit of adaptive, agent controlled. To demonstrate practical applicability, we evaluate and test the system with a storm forecasting scenario and apply a real-world environmental dataset, thereby showing how S3A-AFL enables key operations under limited network conditions.

Simultaneously, the widespread application of wearable sensors makes it easier to locate emergency responders. Therefore, the rapid planning of appropriate rescue paths is a crucial issue. In addition, unlike human behavior patterns, the movement of vehicles is more complex, involving two types of continuous actions: driving direction and speed, both of which are easily influenced by road traffic conditions. In this occasion, a virtual community drill for emergency rescue approach is put forward, specifically, this approach utilizes virtual community scenario to simulate the community traffic environment in the real world and discretizes the community environment and the action space of vehicles.

As a result, MM often fails to replace manual operations effectively. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in supporting robots to perform complex tasks, showing great potential for enabling autonomous materials laboratories. In this study, we introduce an innovative AI-automation framework, named Large Language Model-Graph Reinforcement Learning (LLM-GRL), to improve the efficiency of ceramic materials research. We adopt a hierarchical architecture in which the upper layer uses LLM for robotic task planning while the lower layer leverages graph-based reinforcement learning to train the robot's basic skills.

10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.02109,PyPose: A Library for Robot Learning with Physics-based Optimization,"Deep learning has had remarkable success in robotic perception, but its data-centric nature suffers when it comes to generalizing to ever-changing environments. By contrast, physics-based optimization generalizes better, but it does not perform as well in complicated tasks due to the lack of high-level semantic information and reliance on manual parametric tuning. To take advantage of these two complementary worlds, we present PyPose: a robotics-oriented, PyTorch-based library that combines deep perceptual models with physics-based optimization. PyPose's architecture is tidy and well-organized, it has an imperative style interface and is efficient and user-friendly, making it easy to integrate into real-world robotic applications. Besides, it supports parallel computing of any order gradients of Lie groups and Lie algebras and 2nd-order optimizers, such as trust region methods. Experiments show that PyPose achieves more than 10× speedup in computation compared to the state-of-the-art libraries. To boost future research, we provide concrete examples for several fields of robot learning, including SLAM, planning, control, and inertial navigation."
10.1109/CVPR52734.2025.01469,PDFactor: Learning Tri-Perspective View Policy Diffusion Field for Multi-Task Robotic Manipulation,"Robotic manipulation based on visual observations and natural language instructions is a long-standing challenge in robotics. Yet prevailing approaches model action distribution by adopting explicit or implicit representations, which often struggle to achieve a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. In response, we propose PDFactor, a novel framework that models action distribution with a hybrid triplane representation. In particular, PDFactor decomposes 3D point cloud into three orthogonal feature planes and leverages a tri-perspective view transformer to produce dense cubic features as a latent diffusion field aligned with observation space representing 6-DoF action probability distribution at an arbitrary location. We employ a small denoising network conceptually as both a parameterized loss function measuring the quality of the learned latent features and an action gradient decoder to sample actions from the latent diffusion field during inference. This design enables our PDFactor to benefit from spatial awareness of explicit representation and arbitrary resolution of implicit representation, rendering it with manipulation accuracy, inference efficiency, and model scalability.

This system effectively enhances the language understanding and generation capabilities of inspection robots, thereby enabling rapid response and precise execution of complex instructions. To achieve this goal, the paper utilizes a lightweight LLM, combined with a robotic function library (covering map, language, motion, and vision functions), a task manager, and a two-stage reasoning mechanism. The system first parses instructions using natural language processing, then generates a task plan using coarse-grained and fine-grained reasoning methods, and finally executes the task with the help of the robotic function library. We tested our system in real scenarios for various inspection tasks, and the experimental results show that our system outperforms existing inspection robot systems in language understanding and generation capabilities, especially when using an LLM with 14 billion parameters. Moreover, ablation studies prove the significant impact of different parameter scales of LLMs on system performance, as well as the effectiveness and necessity of the two-stage reasoning mechanism. Although this research has made certain progress in inspection task planning, there are still limitations and challenges such as LLM training costs, diversity and complexity of instructions, and robot execution capabilities. In the future, we plan to further optimize the system, explore more application scenarios, and conduct cross-disciplinary research."

Optimization-based motion planning is a popular method, since it may provide an optimal trajectory. Unfortunately, to avoid obstacle, it is always a non-convex optimization programming in real world application. Hence, it may be a high computational complexity and time-consuming task. To address this issue, this paper presents a successive convex approximation-based fast collision-free motion planning framework to address this issue. The key idea is to convert non-convex collision avoidance constraints into smooth convex constraints and use the successive convex approximation method to improve the computational efficiency. Furthermore, we incorporate the Hybrid A* algorithm to provide good initial guesses and use the Armijo step-size rule to prevent overshooting optimal solutions. The simulation results show that, compared to traditional benchmark methods, the proposed approach improves computational efficiency by an average of 83.6% in scenarios such as vertical, while also generating smoother trajectories. The method's efficiency and robustness make it more suitable for real-time deployment on low-computation platforms."

Existing approaches often neglect dynamic interaction modeling and quantitative comfort assessment. This paper introduces a stress index derived from deformation analysis of agents' social spaces to quantify human discomfort during robot navigation. Building on this metric, a novel framework integrating a dynamic interaction model with deep reinforcement learning is proposed. By embedding the stress index into the state space, reward function, and value network architecture, the method enables robots to optimizing collision-free trajectories while autonomously penalize socially disruptive behaviors. Simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm outperforms conventional approaches, achieving fluent navigation and reducing human stress levels comparing with baseline models. The proposed stress-aware mechanism effectively bridges the gap between robotic efficiency and human-centric requirements, providing a framework for socially compliant navigation in dynamic crowds."

However, reliably modeling human movements over extended periods poses substantial challenges due to human behavior’s inherent complexity. This paper introduces STeF-LSTM, a novel hybrid predictive framework that integrates the strengths of Frequency Map Enhancement (FreMEn) for periodic pattern modeling and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for capturing sequential dependencies. By combining FreMEn’s frequency-domain representation to encode long-term rhythmic patterns and LSTM’s robust short-term sequential learning capabilities, the proposed method addresses the limitations of each standalone approach.

We present the Optimal Orchestration Transport Planner Framework (OOTPF), a unified orchestration architecture for multi robot systems that casts surface leveling as an online Multi Agent Pickup and Delivery (MAPD) problem. OOTPF comprises two principal layers: an Optimal Transport layer that formulates material movement via discrete Earth Mover’s problems, and a Task Allocation layer that employs heuristic bidding and consensus based auctions to assign pickup–delivery jobs to agents. To guarantee safe, collision free execution, we embed a token driven, priority based planning discipline atop a shared space time Reservation Table, invoking Safe Interval Path Planning (SIPP) for single robot requests and Conflict Based Search (CBS) when multiple robots contend. This hierarchical scheme dynamically balances throughput with conflict resolution. Numerical experiments on representative leveling scenarios demonstrate that OOTPF achieves high utilization, zero collisions, and flexible to import different path planner algorithms."

Focusing on metallurgical production logistics, we integrate discrete event simulation, agent-based modeling, and critical path analysis to address bottlenecks caused by shared resource conflicts. The proposed method is implemented in two systems: the BPsim modeling suite and the Automated Metallurgical Control System. For constructing the multi-agent model system of resource conversion processes, this paper adopts Petri nets, queuing theory, system dynamics, and hybrid automata theory. The main object of this model is the resource converter, whose primary function is to transform inputs (resources) into outputs (products) using discrete or continuous operations. To address resource occupation and bottleneck elimination issues in metallurgical processes, we employ operational analysis of probabilistic networks, critical path method, network planning methods, and agent-based planning theory. Combining operational analysis, agent-based planning, and real-time simulation hybrid bottleneck mitigation methods. The results show that a converter feeding interval of 20 minutes maximizes continuous casting machine utilization while preventing steel solidification delays. The framework's adaptability can also be extended to supply chains, production planning, and other resource-constrained systems."

This paper introduces a medical image segmentation architecture that aggregates two neural networks based on the state-of-the-art nnU-Net. Additionally, this study proposes a polyvinyl alcohol cryogel (PVA-C) breast phantom, based on its automated segmentation approach, to enable planning and navigation experiments for robotic breast surgery. The dataset consists of multimodality breast MRI of T2W and STIR images obtained from 10 patients. A statistical analysis of segmentation tasks emphasizes the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), segmentation accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. We first use a single class labeling to segment the breast region and then exploit it as an input for three-class labeling to segment fatty, fibroglandular (FGT), and tumorous tissues. The first network has a 0.95 DCS, while the second network has a 0.95, 0.83, and 0.41 for fat, FGT, and tumor classes, respectively. Clinical Relevance—This research is relevant to the breast surgery community as it establishes a deep learning-based (DL) algorithmic and phantomic foundation for surgical planning and navigation that will exploit preoperative multimodal MRI and intraoperative ultrasound to achieve highly cosmetic breast surgery. In addition, the planning and navigation will guide a robot that can cut, resect, bag, and grasp a tissue mass that encapsulates breast tumors and positive tissue margins.

10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10782151,Selective Clamping for Robot-Assisted Surgical Procedures,"Partial nephrectomy, the gold standard treatment for renal tumors, is performed with clamping of the renal arteries, in order to interrupt the blood flowing towards the tumor. However, the temporary interruption of arterial flow may lead to ischemia of the renal parenchyma. Thus, the interruption of the flow should be as short as possible and the clamping should be localized to the arteries flowing towards the tumor only, by implementing the so-called selective clamping. In this paper, we propose a system to automatically provide to the surgeon the optimal clamping points, according to our methods, which allow to minimize the ischemia percentage, thus preserving the health of the remaining renal parenchyma. Moreover, we exploit the algorithm as a planner for a robotic system that, starting from the clamping points automatically computed, emulates the clamping procedure. The overall architecture is validated on different patient’s anatomies and using a robotic setup."

This study investigated the impact of an SRF use on cognitive function, employing both electroencephalography (EEG) and graph theory analysis (GTA). Three tasks were undertaken by 30 subjects with and without the SRF. The results revealed notable changes during driving, as well as SRF-assisted activities. Increased clustering coefficients in emotional expression regions during SRF-assisted driving contrasted with reduced connectivity strength between frontal brain regions, suggesting altered attention control. Local efficiency (LE) analysis indicated disruptions in neuronal communication during SRF-assisted tasks, impacting attention, motor planning, and judgment actions. Likewise, statistical analyses demonstrated noteworthy shifts in mental states between phases, emphasizing improved communication efficiency with negative LE values. These findings increased our understanding of SRF influence on brain dynamics, which may help guide future development of assistive tools and technology to assist stroke survivors with their day-to-day functional activities."
10.1109/EMES65692.2025.11045571,Adaptive A* RRT* for Robot Navigation in Maze,"Autonomous navigation relies on path planning algorithms that must balance computational efficiency, optimality, and flexibility in challenging environments. $\mathrm{A}^{\ast}$ performs poorly in unstructured surroundings, though it is excellent in gridbased applications with little computing time. Conversely, RRT* handles high-dimensional spaces but has slow convergence and suboptimal paths. The hybrid algorithm (Hybrid A*-RRT*) presented in this paper addresses these limitations by combining the heuristic-driven accuracy of $A^{\ast}$ with the random exploration of RRT*. First, the algorithm generates an optimal path using A* then directionally biases RRT* sampling regions of interest, thereby reducing unnecessary node expansion and accelerating convergence. Experiments demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness across dynamically generated maze environments with varying complexity levels determined by grid cell size. Key performance metrics include path length, the nodes inspected, the number of iterations, and the computational time. In complex environments, the hybrid method reduces computation time by 80 % compared to $A^{\ast}$ and by 59 % compared to RRT*, while maintaining Path lengths within 9 % of A* optimality and exploring 48 % fewer nodes than RRT*. The hybrid approach achieves 100 % success across all study environments, thereby illustrating its value in finding a middle path between solution speed and quality. In 3D or multi-agent circumstances, later studies might use this approach."

Real-world environments can require a system to moderate its actions according to legal or ethical requirements as well as the usual functional requirements. In this paper, we present an implementation of a reference architecture for a robotic system that integrates conduct governance within the perception, tracking, and response pipeline. We define conduct governance as the concept that an autonomous system can interpret a set of rules for its operating domain, and implement components that are designed to act as a safeguard to ensure that autonomous decisions are aligned with these rules and ethical and safety-oriented system requirements. We implemented the reference’s patterns and practices to react to visual targets, while adhering to changing sets of high-level conduct rules. We found that, compared to traditional uses of machine learning models, the conduct governance architecture enables a higher level of observability and traceability into autonomous and intelligent systems, and provides tunable guardrails around systems that may be running one or more machine learning models. We also present lessons learned from implementing such an architecture."

If unexpected events occur, the robot might either stop working altogether or do something that violates its given mission specification. In this paper, we aim to provide a more principled mechanism for dealing with specifications when encountering the inherent uncertainty of the real-world. We utilise agent-based control of a robotic system wherein a rational agent, programmed using a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent programming language, acts as a high-level robot controller. This agent is aware of its mission specification and is able to recognise violations of this specification caused by unexpected events. On recognising such a violation, the agent can switch to a more suitable plan. However, if there are no suitable plans, the agent can also weaken its mission specification dynamically. The agent can output not only which parts of the mission specification have been achieved but which parts have been weakened and why."

This paper presents a layered architecture that bridges this gap by integrating LLMs with digital twins and physical automation systems, with reference to practical case studies as proof of concept. The proposed architecture comprises three layers: a cognitive layer powered by LLMs, a bridging layer based on digital twins, and a physical layer consisting of technical process and automation system. Within the digital twin layer, we introduce three design paradigms for structuring information to support effective LLM integration: state snapshot modeling, event message modeling, and plan sequence modeling. These paradigms are demonstrated through prototypical case studies on robotic automation control and process simulation. To address challenges such as hallucination, task complexity, and system reliability, we distill a set of practical strategies, including multi-agent system design, human validation, and test-driven development.

Under these conditions, traditional data-driven grasp planning methods are often infeasible due to their reliance on large, annotated datasets and stable object libraries. This paper presents an architecture for ontology-based semantic grasp planning that enables efficient and intuitive manual grasp pose specification without requiring extensive expertise in geometric programming or machine learning. By leveraging semantic representations of object geometries, gripper capabilities, and task-specific constraints, the system supports context-aware grasp candidate generation and prioritization. While the interpretation of the semantic models identifies suitable grasp types and involved geometric faces of objects and grippers, an optimization step generates suitable 6D poses that meet given constraints. As a result, the complexity of manually instructing robot systems for manipulation tasks is reduced and can be efficiently carried out by non-expert users."

Traditional methods such as Force-based motion planning (FMP) & deep reinforcement learning (RL) often struggle to handle complex scenarios involving multiple autonomous agents due to their inherent limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose a hybrid algorithm that seamlessly combines the strengths of RL and FMP while leveraging the coordination capabilities of a multi-agent system. By integrating this hybrid algorithm into a multi-agent framework, we demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling multiple agents to navigate densely populated environments with dynamic obstacles. Through extensive simulation studies, we illustrate the superior performance of our approach compared to traditional methods, achieving higher success rates and improved efficiency in scenarios involving simultaneous motion planning for multiple agents.

A multi-agent autonomous system based on such rules has the ability to distribute subtasks between agents and complete its goals. There is a need to create a set of rules that would fully describe the behavior of both individual agents and the behavior of a multi-agent system. The work describes syntax of the rules and system architecture of an autonomous robot. We have implemented a rule parser, a dependency network, and an interpreter. The interpreter was integrated with applied software that implements search algorithms and provides decision trees for decision making. In the process of global planning, the search for the optimal solution is carried out, taking into account time spent and resources.

10.1109/GACLM67198.2025.11231998,Adversarial and Multilingual Threats in Retrieval-Augmented Generation: From Prompt Injection to Model Exploitation,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a cornerstone of modern generative AI by coupling large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge retrieval, thereby enabling more grounded, accurate, and context-aware outputs. Yet this paradigm simultaneously broadens the attack surface—extending vulnerabilities from generation into retrieval pipelines, language interfaces, and exposed APIs. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive threat taxonomy and adversarial framework targeting both conventional and agentic RAG systems, in which LLMs autonomously plan and execute multi-step tasks using retrieved knowledge. Our analysis spans a wide spectrum of adversarial techniques, including prompt injection, jailbreak exploits, API-driven model extraction, and multilingual prompt manipulation. Unlike prior work that primarily focuses on English-only vulnerabilities, we show that multilingual RAG pipelines—particularly those involving language blending (e.g., Arabic-English code-switching)—introduce novel attack vectors that bypass safety filters and induce unintended behaviors. To study these risks, we develop a multilingual adversarial benchmark suite that integrates both synthetic and real-world corpora across English, Arabic, and Spanish. Through systematic evaluation, we demonstrate how the retrieval layer not only amplifies leakage and inversion risks but also enables adversaries to infer system logic, extract private data from vector stores, and manipulate autonomous agent behavior through tool-integrated APIs. To mitigate these threats, we assess multiple defense strategies, including prompt sanitization, cross-lingual content filtering, retriever-stage anomaly detection, and behavior-based profiling of API interactions. Our findings reveal that existing safeguards are insufficient—particularly in agentic or low-resource language scenarios—underscoring the need for architecture-specific and multilingual defenses. This work fills a critical gap in GenAI security by presenting the first holistic, multilingual, and agent-aware security framework for RAG, offering actionable guidance for building robust and trustworthy generative AI applications across diverse linguistic and deployment contexts."

In this paper, we propose, DyStore, a framework of item location encoding and navigation that can encode the locations of cabinets, drawers, and boxes for efficient item access in an intelligent locker system. DyStore includes a user interface, a central control server, and an item storage system built upon cabinets/lockers. Given storage space constraints, we propose a hybrid data structure that combines trees and bitmaps for encoding the item locations.

However, deploying multiple UAVs may cause spectrum congestion. Therefore, this article investigates the joint optimization of the trajectory planning and channel selection of multiple UAVs to assist the IoT network for fresh data collection, with age of information (AoI) measurement. Firstly, we formulate combinatorial optimization issue as a partially observable Markov problem, and then propose a trajectory planning and channel selection (TPCS) algorithm based on the multi-agent actor-critic (MAAC) architecture. Due to the three-dimensional interference of the environment, the TPCS algorithm also utilizes the characteristics of soft actor–critic (SAC) to avoid agents falling into local optimum. Simulation results show that the proposed TPCS algorithm can achieve smaller average AoI and higher transmission rate than other benchmark algorithms, which means it can obtain better learning strategies."

Due to the high speed movement and limited on-board energy of LEO satellites, as well as the uneven distribution of service requests on the ground, it is difficult to achieve optimal satellite communication performance using a static inter-satellite links (ISLs) scheme and a fixed transmission power per link. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a joint optimization algorithm based on parameterized deep reinforcement learning (named DeepISL) for dynamic planning of ISLs between different planes and transmit power allocation per link. First, a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is established by modeling the communication, energy, and overall energy efficiency as well as the antenna steering costs. Second, to solve the hybrid action space problem with discrete action variables for ISL planning and continuous action variables for power allocation, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning with parameterized action space is used to obtain the optimal joint strategy. Finally, extensive experiments illustrate that our proposed algorithm can improve the energy efficiency of the constellation by 4.2% ~ 10.5% compared to the comparison algorithms, and can also achieve better performance in terms of throughput and ISLs switching ratio."

As an emerging technique, multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) coordination technique brings a promising prospect to dam inspection, in which the core of the technique is UAVs Coverage Path Panning (UAVs-CPP), i.e., designing flight routes for UAVs to ensure comprehensive coverage of all point of interests within a dam region. Unfortunately, the dam region inevitably encounters natural disasters such as, the thunderstorm, strong wind, and earthquake, which is called abnormal environment. The abnormal environment triggers two issues: 1) the natural disasters leads to communication obstacles between UAVs due to communication link interruption and signal loss, and 2) the coverage and energy consumption of UAVs cannot be neglected. The existing coverage path planning algorithms are insufficient in the abnormal environment. To tackle these issue, a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based architecture is devised for UAVs-CPP in the dam inspection under the abnormal environment, called Trace Pheromone Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TP-MADDPG). Specifically, we first integrate a trace pheromone mechanism and Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG). The trace pheromone mechanism can simulate the natural pheromone, which promotes the inner indirect communication between UAVs. Furthermore, we employ a MADDPG to perform UAVs-CPP, in which a reward function is designed to conjointly optimize coverage and energy consumption. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that TP-MADDPG shows significant UAVs-CPP performance contrasted with the advanced benchmarks."

To address these challenges, this paper introduces a “UAV-as-a-Service” (UaaS) paradigm, an application paradigm innovation that leverages the core infrastructure of telecom operators. Our primary contribution is a closed-loop intelligent method, representing an algorithmic innovation, centered on a 3D Dynamic Risk Map (DRM). The DRM is generated in real-time by a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) and explicitly informs both a risk-aware Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) dispatcher and a hybrid Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star (RRT*)-Model Predictive Control (MPC) path planner. This tight coupling ensures that tactical decisions are grounded in a holistic understanding of risk. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed UaaS model substantially enhances operational outcomes, reducing the time to achieve critical situational awareness by over 75 % and decreasing firefighter risk exposure by $\mathbf{7 8 \%}$. These technical advancements validate a novel and viable Business-to-Government (B2G) service model, demonstrating significant technologycommercial synergy."

This is the third time that the HRI research community cannot meet in person, because of the COVID-19 pandemic; originally, we planned and hoped for at least a hybrid conference to be hosted in Sapporo, to finally bring back the conference to Japan. Our theme “Breaking Boundaries,” reflected this notion of breaking the boundaries between virtual and real-world spaces. However, there are more boundaries our community wants to break: between robotic technology and people - in order to create safe, meaningful, and wanted human-robot interactions for people and society, between scientific disciplines, communities, and backgrounds - in order to create new ways of thinking about our future lives with robotic technology. The HRI Conference is the premium venue for publishing and presenting top-quality HRI research and the virtual format might even allow us to attract and include more people who would not have the opportunity to travel to Japan."

Over a decade later, formulating robot capabilities remains a significant technical hurdle in bringing robots from the lab into everyday life. This paper introduces Capabilities2, a successor to the original Capabilities package, now reimagined for ROS2. Capabilities2 enhances the original design by enabling advancements in skill-based control techniques and offering a more efficient, extensible framework for defining and utilising robot capabilities. We delve into its application in new real-world scenarios, with a particular focus on human-robot interactions and the deployment of collaborative mobile robots in human-centric environments. Capabilities2 addresses challenges in implementing intuitive, collaborative robots by introducing an abstracted database handler, an object-relational mapping for capability models, and a plugin architecture for capability execution. These features support dynamic capability representation, runtime adaptability, and integration with modern AI techniques for skill-based task planning. By providing a standardised yet flexible framework, Capabilities2 reduces the integration effort required to develop top-level controls for real-world scenarios, facilitating rapid development and deployment. Our contributions include the reimplementation of the Capabilities package in ROS2, enhancements to support contemporary robotic applications, and demonstrations of new use cases enabled by Capabilities2. We believe that Capabilities2 significantly advances the field of robotics by equipping developers with tools to create more capable, adaptable, and interactive robots.

For complex robots, IK methods are often based on root search and nonlinear optimization algorithms. These algorithms can be massively sped up using a neural network to predict a good initial guess, which can then be refined in a few numerical iterations. Besides previous work on learning-based IK, we present a learning approach for the fundamentally more complex problem of IK with collision avoidance. We do this in diverse and previously unseen environments. From a detailed analysis of the IK learning problem, we derive a network and unsupervised learning architecture that removes the need for a sample data generation step. Using the trained network's prediction as an initial guess for a two-stage Jacobian-based solver allows for fast and accurate computation of the collision-free IK. For the humanoid robot, Agile Justin (19 DoF), the collision-free IK is solved in less than 10 ms (on a single CPU core) and with an accuracy of $1 \times 10^{-4}\mathrm{m}$ and $1\times 10^{-3}$ rad based on a high-resolution world model generated from the robot's integrated 3D sensor. Our method massively outperforms a random multi-start baseline in a benchmark with the 19 DoF humanoid and challenging 3D environments. It requires ten times less training time than a supervised training method while achieving comparable results."

In order to meet the requirements of privacy and efficiency of power data consensus, a distributed consensus mechanism VPP-PBFT suitable for virtual power plant transaction blockchain is proposed.

Secondly, credit evaluation indicators of market entities are designed, and a distributed consensus mechanism VPP-PBFT is proposed for virtual power plant transactions. Based on the credit value, system selection and node status change are realized, and monitoring node consensus process is added. Based on this, the consistency protocol of traditional PBFT consensus algorithm is simplified. The simulation of the example shows that VPP-PBFT consensus mechanism has the ability to judge the credit of market entities, improve the efficiency of consensus on the premise of ensuring the reliability of consensus, meet the transaction requirements of virtual power plants, and encourage market entities to maintain their own credit."

While initially focused on applications with passenger vehicles, we have extended our expertise to other domains by adapting our automation platforms to support other use cases. Despite differences in implementation, these platforms share a common architecture, enabling a standardized development, testing, and deployment process.

Accidental fire occurs frequently and can be controlled but sometimes result in severe loss of life and property. To prevent these deadly activities, an autonomous fire-fighting robot is introduced. The bot will be activated as soon as the information of the fire accident reaches the bot. Once the location is fixed with google API, waypoints can be marked through the mission planner with the help of the GPS module. The bot will autonomously reach the destination using computer vision technologies. Lane, obstacle, and traffic light detections are executed to enable the autonomous drive.

The architecture integrates upper-layer dynamic priority scheduling with spatiotemporal constraint propagation and lower-layer safe interval path planning (SIPP) guided by reverse resumable A* (RRA*) global heuristic search, achieving conflict preemption and path optimization. Core algorithmic innovations include: (1) A sliding temporal window-based dynamic priority adjustment strategy to alleviate long-term blocking of low-priority agents; (2) Narrow-passage conflict prediction and alternative path pre-planning mechanisms to reduce deadlock risks; (3) RRA* historical state reuse and spatiotemporal constraint recursion to compress redundant search spaces. Experiments demonstrate that in high-density warehouse maps, the algorithm achieves collision-free planning success rates in multi-agent scenarios, with significant makespan reduction and improved computational efficiency compared to existing MAPF methods. Despite local path suboptimality caused by temporal window discretization, its advantages in continuous task support, dynamic environment adaptability, and balanced computational efficiency provide a reliable solution for large-scale cluster scheduling in logistics automation."

In contrast, cognitive architectures (CA) excel in symbolic reasoning and state monitoring but are constrained by rigid predefined execution. This work bridges these approaches by probing OpenVLA's hidden layers to uncover symbolic representations of object properties, relations, and action states, enabling integration with a CA for enhanced interpretability and robustness. Through experiments on LIBERO-spatial pick-and-place tasks, we analyze the encoding of symbolic states across different layers of OpenVLA's Llama backbone. Our probing results show consistently high accuracies (>0.90) for both object and action states across most layers, though contrary to our hypotheses, we did not observe the expected pattern of object states being encoded earlier than action states. We demonstrate an integrated DIARCOpenVLA system that leverages these symbolic representations for real-time state monitoring, laying the foundation for more interpretable and reliable robotic manipulation. © 2025 IEEE."

These approaches lead to suboptimal resource utilization, increased costs, and potential safety risks. We address these limitations by proposing a novel Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient framework integrated with Transformer Encoder architecture (TE-MADDPG) for multi-plant spare parts management. Our innovation lies in modeling each power plant as an independent decision-making agent within a Markov Decision Process that dynamically incorporates inter-plant distances, spare part values, criticality indexes, and real-time demand patterns. The Transformer Encoder component effectively solves the challenge of handling variable-length observation spaces across different plants—a significant limitation in previous approaches. Experimental validation with operational data from 8 power plants demonstrates that TE-MADDPG consistently outperforms traditional methods, achieving an average 2.3% reduction in procurement costs and substantial improvements in transfer efficiency, particularly during high-demand periods. Our framework provides a scalable, adaptable solution that enhances both operational safety and economic performance in power generation facilities."

The platform adopts a hierarchical collaborative design, comprising four layers: the user interaction layer (3D visualization and dynamic parameter configuration), the core decision-making layer (task scheduling and conflict coordination), the data layer (structured knowledge base and real-time caching), and the execution layer (specialized Agent cluster), collectively forming a closed-loop autonomous decision-making system. By leveraging knowledge graph technology, the platform encodes design rules and historical cases into structured knowledge, while integrating a dynamic path planning mechanism to enable cross-disciplinary collaborative optimization-for example, automatically adjusting anchoring strategies when civil engineering model accuracy is insufficient. The multi-Agent negotiation mechanism significantly enhances adaptability in complex engineering scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the platform can substantially reduce modeling cycles and minimize human errors.

The modules have limited computational capabilities, interact only with neighboring modules, and can move around adjacent modules from a cell to an empty neighboring cell under specific conditions. An important well-studied problem for these robotic systems is Motion Planning, also known as Shape Formationor Self-reconfiguration, requiring the modules to organize themselves into a pre-determined final configuration (i.e., shape); basic shapes such as the line (or chain) are especially important as they are utilized as a foundation for constructing more complicated shapes and are an initial measure for handling complicated tasks. A metamorphic robots system could offer a higher degree of reliability and robustness compared to fixed-architecture robots due to its capacity to self-repair: should some modules fail and no longer move, the shape could be reconstructed by the non-faulty modules. To do this correctly, efficiently, and without restricting the autonomy of the modules is a non-trivial task. In this paper, we study the Line Recoveryproblem, requiring the non-faulty modules to reconstruct the line without violation of connectivity requirements at any time during the recovery procedure. A thorough feasibility characterization of the problem, the necessary conditions for its solvability, and an algorithm that solves the problem, regardless of the number and distribution of faults, are provided."

10.1109/ICBASE66587.2025.11181399,Multi-agent Collaborative Decision-making Mechanism Combining Reinforcement Learning and Graph Attention Network,"Multi-agent collaborative decision-making faces three core problems: inefficient modeling of relationships between agents in partially observable environments, poor scalability of traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, and inaccurate global reward allocation mechanisms. This study proposes a collaborative framework that integrates graph attention networks (GAT) and multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradients (MADDPG), aiming to build a relationship-aware agent decisionmaking mechanism: first, GAT is used to dynamically learn the adjacency matrix, and the agent interaction relationship is encoded through a two-layer attention mechanism; then a joint reward function is designed, and the centralized critic network is combined to evaluate the collaborative utility; the Centralized Training architecture is used to verify it in the StarCraft II multiagent challenge environment. Experiments show that in the 15agent pursuit task, the success rate of this framework reaches 95.7%; in the heterogeneous agent formation task, the path planning efficiency is improved by 36.4 seconds. This method explicitly models the agent dependencies through a graph structure, solving the problem of traditional methods in complex collaboration."
10.1109/ICBDSE65491.2025.11220132,SC-DVHT: Spectrum-Constrained MARL for Dynamic Vehicle Control in Heterogeneous Traffic,"In dense heterogeneous traffic scenarios, the co-evolution of long-term strategic planning and instantaneous behavioral responses in driving patterns exhibits strong coupling dynamics, leading to substantial uncertainties in intention inference and trajectory prediction (e.g., frequent lane-changing behaviors may stem from transient road anomalies or persistent driving habits). Conventional autonomous driving approaches struggle to address these challenges due to inherent limitations in pattern disambiguation, computational efficiency, and temporal modeling. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes SC-DVHT (Spectral-Constraint Dynamic Vehicle Heterogeneous Traffic framework), which establishes a dynamic spectral-spatiotemporal joint modeling architecture for effective decoupling of multi-scale driving characteristics:(1)The dynamic spectral-constraint mechanism confines behavioral cycles to physically interpretable from 3 to $T / 2$ intervals to suppress both high-frequency noise artifacts and low-frequency pseudo-periodic disturbances;(2)Asymmetric convolutional kernel assemblies coupled with sparse attention gating mechanisms collaboratively extract micro-scale maneuvers (e.g., steering angles) and macro-scale tactical patterns (e.g., overtaking frequencies);(3)Multi-granularity contextual modeling integrates second-level instantaneous behaviors with minute-level strategic evolution, enabling holistic intention reasoning that “captures both granular details and global patterns”.Experimental results demonstrate that in heterogeneous highway environments, TemporalNet outperforms the Decentralized Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) MARL algorithm (iPLAN) by $11.7 \%$ in survival duration and $9.1 \%$ in success rate under moderate traffic conditions. When benchmarked against QMIX - the widelyused CTDE (Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution) framework in multi-agent reinforcement learning - the proposed method demonstrates superior performance in moderate traffic conditions, exhibiting a $1.37 \%$ extension in operational duration, $13.27 \%$ enhancement in mission completion efficiency, and $7.72 \%$ improvement in motion continuity maintenance. Notably, in chaotic traffic scenarios, SC-DVHT exhibits $0.8 \%$ and $7.4 \%$ improvements in survival time and success rate over iPLAN, respectively. These findings confirm that spectral-spatiotemporal joint modeling significantly enhances robustness of intention perception in complex traffic environments, establishing a novel paradigm for high-density dynamic driving decisionmaking systems."

Since the traditional ground-based and geostationary earth orbit (GEO)-based telemetry systems are unsuitable for monitoring the operation status of mega constellations, a networked telemetry system is adopted to achieve full time, low delay telemetry in this paper. In order to satisfy the data transmission requirements of extensive satellites, this paper formulates the channel allocation problem, which aims at maximizing the overall transmitted data value by allocating different medium earth orbit (MEO) beams in different time slots to different LEO satellites. Since the data generation states of LEO satellites are hybrid constant and stochastic, the MEO satellites could allocate channels more timely than the ground mission center, and the action space for channel allocation is too large, the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning based algorithm is consequently adopted to solve the channel allocation problem. This paper verifies the effectiveness of our proposed channel allocation algorithm by numerical simulation."
10.1109/ICC52391.2025.11160899,Hybrid Beamforming for C-NOMA-Enabled Multi-UAVs in 6G IoT Networks,"The advent of $\mathbf{6 G}$ Internet of Things (IoT) networks demands ultra-reliable, energy-efficient communications to support the massive integration of connected devices. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has emerged as a key technology to improve spectral efficiency (SE) by allowing multiple IoT devices (IDs) to share the same frequency resource block through power-domain multiplexing. However, as the number of IDs increases, NOMA faces significant interference challenges, which limit its scalability and degrade system performance. To address these limitations, we propose a clustered NOMA (C-NOMA) framework, which organizes IDs into clusters and applies NOMA within each cluster, reducing interference and improving the effectiveness of successive interference cancellation (SIC). Additionally, we integrate hybrid beamforming (HBF) with C-NOMA, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serve as mobile base stations using 2D uniform planar array (UPA) antennas for beam steering. This enables multiple IDs to be served within each cluster with fewer RF chains, further enhancing SE through spatial multiplexing and beam steering. In order to solve the energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem, we reformulate the optimization problem of HBF and power allocation (PA) as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve it using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Simulation results show that our proposed Full-RL algorithm achieves up to 37.7 % higher EE compared to the baseline RL-based PA method. This baseline only uses RL for PA and relies on the averaged phase for analog beamforming without further optimization."

To achieve on-line navigation on resource-constrained platforms, a fair amount of research has been devoted to develop real-time SLAM accelerators. However, most existing accelerators have the following limitations: (1) relying on hand-crafted visual features, which cannot offer robust feature association in complex environments; (2) only recovering sparse points of the observed scene, which are not adequate for high-level tasks such as obstacle avoidance and path planning. In this paper, we present EDS-SLAM, an energy-efficient and robust architecture for real-time dense stereo SLAM system based on learned feature matching to achieve real-time visual localization and dense mapping reconstruction. To achieve both resource efficiency and perception robustness, EDS-SLAM utilizes a share-used binary neural network (BNN) architecture to perform not only key-points association for computing robust camera poses, but also stereo matching for obtaining high-quality mapping. In EDS-SLAM, we design a set of dedicated, well optimized accelerators to achieve real-time implementations for the pipelines of stereo matching, feature extraction and key-point association. The effectiveness of EDS-SLAM is evaluated through comprehensive experiments. Compared to the state-of-the-art dense SLAM system with software-based implementation, EDS-SLAM achieves comparable accuracy on the localization but higher precision dense 3D mapping with up to $2.03\times$ speed-up as well as up to $23.1\times$ energy efficiency improvement, respectively."

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), owing to their high flexibility and mobility, have become key enablers in ISCC networks. However, most existing studies on UAV-assisted networks mainly focus on partial components of sensing, communication, and computation, without fully considering their joint impact, leading to difficulties in ensuring end-to-end information freshness. To address this problem, building upon the concept of Age of Information (AoI), we specifically design Task-oriented AoI (TAoI). This metric enables a comprehensive evaluation of information timeliness across the entire processing pipeline, from raw sensing data to final results, by accounting for factors such as sensing update intervals, transmission failures, and computation delays. Based on the TAoI metric, we further develop a joint trajectory and task scheduling scheme to ensure the freshness of sensing data.

The brain activity is solely used to generate commands that can be recognized by the computer. To generate a recognizable brain activity, usually the subject imagines the movements of one's limbs without performing any real movement. In the literature, this paradigm is called Motor Imagery (MI). The subject provides data through a particular recording technology, such as EEG, in a certain time frame, in which the subject forces himself/herself into the feeling of performing a particular action. Each recorded data is linked to a label, and different techniques are used to learn patterns, in order to map them correctly. The goal of this paper is to investigate, whether it is possible to generate similar results as in the case of imagining the movement of limbs, by imagining the movement of an external object. To investigate this, we compare the performance of Motor Imagery and Object Motor Imagery. In the first case the mental task consists of imagining the movements of arms, while in the second the imagining of moving an external box through solely brain activity. A video of a box that moves through a plane in two directions, right, left, is used as visual feedback in both cases. The recorded EEG data are split into training and testing subsets, and are fed to a deep neural network, that tries to learn the different patterns and to classify them.

A widely used image technique that aids in the visualisation of brain structures and makes anomalies like tumors visible is magnetic resonance imaging or MRI.

Conditioned on egocentric and proprioceptive observations of a robot, Skill Transformer is trained end-to-end to predict both a high-level skill (e.g., navigation, picking, placing), and a whole-body low-level action (e.g., base and arm motion), using a transformer architecture and demonstration trajectories that solve the full task. It retains the composability and modularity of the overall task through a skill predictor module while reasoning about low-level actions and avoiding hand-off errors, common in modular approaches. We test Skill Transformer on an embodied rearrangement benchmark and find it performs robust task planning and low-level control in new scenarios, achieving a 2.5x higher success rate than baselines in hard rearrangement problems."

However, the widespread adoption of LLMs presents several challenges, such as integration into existing applications and infrastructure, utilization of company proprietary data, models, and APIs, and meeting cost, quality, responsiveness, and other requirements. To address these challenges, there is a notable shift from monolithic models to compound AI systems, with the premise of more powerful, versatile, and reliable applications. However, progress thus far has been piecemeal, with proposals for agentic workflows, programming models, and extended LLM capabilities, without a clear vision of an overall architecture. In this paper, we propose a ‘blueprint architecture’ for compound AI systems for orchestrating agents and data for enterprise applications. In our proposed architecture the key orchestration concept is ‘streams' to coordinate the flow of data and instructions among agents. Existing proprietary models and APIs in the enterprise are mapped to ‘agents', defined in an ‘agent registry’ that serves agent metadata and learned representations for search and planning. Agents can utilize proprietary data through a ‘data registry’ that similarly registers enterprise data of various modalities. Tying it all together, data and task ‘planners' break down, map, and optimize tasks and queries for given quality of service (QoS) requirements such as cost, accuracy, and latency. We illustrate an implementation of the architecture for a use-case in the HR domain and discuss opportunities and challenges for ‘agentic AI’ in the enterprise."

We propose a framework for CPS by robots for discovering novel actions via behavior babbling, capable of learning a representation of novel actions at both a symbolic planning level, and a sub-symbolic action controller level. Our framework employs two modes of discovery - a focused incubation method that scopes its search to the actions and entities composing the failed plan, and a defocused incubation method which enables exploration of actions and entities outside of the failed plan. We implemented and tested our framework using a Baxter robot in a 3D physics-based simulation environment, where we ran three proof-of-concept object manipulation scenarios. Results suggest that it is possible to use behavior babbling as a method for the autonomous discovery of flexible and reusable actions. © 2021 IEEE."
10.1109/ICDL63968.2025.11204386,Predictability-Based Curiosity-Guided Action Symbol Discovery*,"Discovering symbolic representations for skills is essential for abstract reasoning and efficient planning in robotics. Previous neuro-symbolic robotic studies mostly focused on discovering perceptual symbolic categories given a predefined action repertoire and generating plans with given action symbols. A truly developmental robotic system, on the other hand, should be able to discover all the abstractions required for the planning system with minimal human intervention. In this study, we propose a novel system that is designed to discover symbolic action primitives along with perceptual symbols autonomously. Our system is based on an encoder-decoder structure with a bottleneck layer with discrete activation that takes object and action information as input and predicts the generated effect. To efficiently explore the vast continuous action parameter space, we introduce a Curiosity-Based exploration module that selects the most informative actions—the ones that maximize the entropy in the predicted effect distribution. The discovered symbolic action primitives are then used to make plans using a symbolic tree search strategy in single- and double-object manipulation tasks. We compare our model with two baselines that use different exploration strategies in different experiments. The results show that our approach can learn a diverse set of symbolic action primitives, which are effective for generating plans in order to achieve given manipulation goals."

These systems usually involve contextual information related to users and devices, which may put constraints on the presentation of multimedia documents. An effective solution consists in adapting their contents according to the current context. Most of existing adaptation approaches try to select, compose and execute adaptation services in order to provide adapted documents. Even so, they, however, do not address the need to deal with dynamic environments for which there does not exist a global view about the available services. Also, they do not care about the increasing number of users' requests. These aspects have a direct influence on the quality of service. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel self-organizing multi agent based architecture for adapting multimedia documents. The agents cooperate in a decentralized structure to optimize the selection, composition and execution of service plans. The self-organization of the system is ensured by updating the structural relations between the agents according to trust values.

Coordination between team members is critical to mission success, especially in dynamic, time-critical environments. As highly automated agents become more prevalent, effective HAT become crucial to maintain effective coordination. This especially applies to our domain of Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T) in which manned and unmanned aircraft act as collaborative teammates, with pilots acting as integrated combat members and decision-makers. We see a clear need for design patterns that support the development of agents that meet the requirements of effective HAT. The development of these patterns focuses on MUM-T and is carried out in two steps. Firstly, we conduct a review study to identify the general behavioural patterns, coordination mechanisms, and enablers of effective teaming. Secondly, these findings are then compared with organizational paradigms from Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). The requirements for effective HAT are then used to propose a hybrid two-layer cognitive work system that can be used for MUM-T missions. The first layer of this design pattern represents the tactical planning team, where the pilot and an agent collaborate on mission planning. The second layer represents tactical execution, where agents and UAVs jointly execute this plan.

Tomatoes, being predominantly selfpollinated, depend on airflow to transfer pollen from the anther to the stigma within the flower. In isolated environments like greenhouses, ensuring effective air pollination presents a significant challenge. Due to limited natural airflow, greenhouses often rely on mechanical ventilation systems which cannot adequately replicate the natural pollination process. In this work, a low-cost but efficient autonomous pollination system is developed for tomato plants in greenhouses that utilize both deep learning capability as well as robotic hardware manipulation. The deep learning model is based on the YOLOv8 Nano architecture that is customized with a transformer module which achieved an mAP@50 score of $\mathbf{9 4. 6}$ percent for mature flower detection. Explainable AI (XAI) like EigenCAM and XGrad-CAM approach showed correct visualization over the flower area with minimum noise. The developed model was implemented on the Nvidia Jetson Nano where the Bot-SORT tracking algorithm was used to avoid over-pollination of the same flower. For real-time application, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) app was developed which functioned together with the hardware system using closed-loop feedback control on a pan-tilt mechanism for targeting each mature tomato flower.

The upper branch captures semantic features, while the lower branch enhances computational efficiency and local feature representation. This hybrid design allows the model to effectively capture both global and local features, improving segmentation accuracy. The residual connection ensures stable gradient flow, while the low computational cost makes the approach suitable for real-time robotic-assisted vascular interventions. The method was evaluated on the DRIVE and CHASE_DB1 datasets, with experimental results demonstrating superior performance in Acc (0.9653), F1-score (0.8156), and IoU (0.6886), compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining a lightweight architecture suitable for real-time clinical applications."

However, integrating heterogeneous subsystems, such as perception, navigation, and manipulation, into a cohesive workflow remains an open challenge. This paper presents a unified mobile manipulation system capable of autonomous search-and-fetch operations by seamlessly integrating real-time mapping, path planning, object detection, and grasping. To enhance human-robot interaction, the system incorporates multimodal control via face recognition, gesture recognition, and voice commands, allowing intuitive user-directed operation. Control Lyapunov Functions and Control Barrier Functions are integrated in a hierarchical motion controller to mitigate tracking error and establish safety constraint. Meanwhile, a hybrid learning-optimization grasping algorithm is implemented to generate robust and precise grasping poses for target object manipulation by leveraging convolutional neural networks and gripper kinematic constraints. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness for indoor search-and-fetch applications, validating its potential to address labor shortages through reliable automation."

The paper presents a novel synthesis of enhancement strategies across four complementary cognitive dimensions: planning, memory, world modeling, and neuro-symbolic integration. Although LLMs have shown remarkable performance in language-based tasks, their reasoning abilities remain limited, particularly in areas such as causal inference, long-term planning, and common sense understanding, capabilities vital for domains like satellite mission engineering design and spacecraft operations. This paper systematically examine these cognitive bottlenecks and the challenges posed by hallucinations, which undermine trust and reliability. The review then explores promising strategies for augmenting LLM capabilities, including integration with knowledge graphs and symbolic reasoning systems, the development of internal ""world models,"" memory and attention-based architectural innovations, and advanced training techniques such as instruction tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and chain-of-thought prompting. Furthermore, we analyze hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches and multi-agent architectures as emerging paradigms that blend deep learning with structured reasoning. Overall, this work aims to provide a foundation for advancing LLMs toward more robust, generalizable, and cognitively grounded artificial intelligence systems by mapping the landscape of current research and identifying the most promising directions for future development."

The method of sensor fusion consists of merging the data from different sensors to obtain more accurate data for object detection as well as parameters and statements required for the auto location, mapping, path planning, motion control, and motion execution. There are different ways to make possible the human-robot interaction, but no matter the concept implemented the safety of the human and the robot needs to be one of the priorities of the robotic system. In this paper the continuation of the research work is presented from the previously proposed robotic system. The robotic system is extended to include a safety controller and priority module. Also, the improved architecture will be able to receive commands from multiple human inputs, and it will determine which command will have the higher priority to be executed.

Therefore, industrial plants with continuous production come to work without any type of feedback, which causes uncertainty and possible incidents. The present project shows the development of a system for the detection, recognition, and grasping of objects using a robotic arm. The system was developed with SSDResNet50 architecture for object detection and in the case of the grasping area detection, we propose an architecture that deploys a grasping area represented on a vector of 4 values. On the other hand, we made the integration and simulation of all developed sub-systems to perform grasping on Robot Operating System (ROS). The system achieves a minimum error in the detection of objects, reaching a value of 94.0% in the evaluation mAP, for the detection of the grasp area, a 26.32% is obtained in the Jaccard metric. It should be noted that a dataset generated within the simulation environment has been used. Finally, the grasping success of each object was evaluated, obtaining an average rate of success of 85.76% among all objects."
10.1109/ICMRE54455.2022.9734106,A View Planning Method for 3D Reconstruction with Unknown Feature Prediction,"Active reconstruction can be considered as an intelligent perception problem that seeks to optimize the efficiency of the modeling tasks by adjusting the configuration of vision system on robotic platform automatically. We consider a feature as several local surfaces that have the same kinds of characteristics. A standard geometry can be defined by attributes abstracted from a set of features. For the regular geometry of the same category, descriptions and topological relations about these objects’ features are known before modeling tasks. In order to maximize the acquisition of an object’s surface in a few views, knowledge of its features is employed as partial prior information that guides the view planning in active reconstruction. Since each reconstruction task may have a different type of object to be rebuilt, in order to make the view planning algorithm suitable for different tasks, we store the prior information of the object in a fixed-form database, so as to call the content of the library to perform verification and reasoning of all features, and make predictions on unknown local surface and rough shape of the object. The predicted unknown surface is discretized and then marked as predicted voxels in the voxel space, which are used to evaluate the priority of all candidate viewpoints, together with the detected voxels. A novel hybrid optimization function is proposed that takes the constraint on overlap, the accessibility of predicted surface, and the amount of unknown object surface into account. Simulated experiments are conducted and the results show that our method is efficient for reconstruction."
10.1109/ICMSR2020.2022.00009,Simulation and Validation of A Dual-motor Coupled Joint Actuator,"Flat motor + planetary reducer and flat motor + harmonic reducer are two typical driving configurations of joint actuators in many robotic applications. Nevertheless, they still have inherent technological limitations and a new joint driving architecture is highly desirable in the robotics research community. We proposed a dual-motor coupled joint actuator aiming for better kinematics performance, fast dynamic response, and high power density. Two motors were placed at the upper and lower module of the joint actuator, and their power was coupled by a planetary reducer. The speed differential of two motors determined the joint actuator’s rotation states: speed, direction, and stop. 3D simulation shows that this new design could smoothly change motion with a 360-degree rotation range and fast dynamic response, successfully satisfying project expectations and demonstrating its usability. This new design could provide a third option in addition to mainstream configurations with improved kinetics and kinematics performance, particularly suitable as a modularized joint driving unit for various robotic applications."
10.1109/ICMT56556.2022.9997618,Solar Energy Profiles for a Blockchain-based Energy Market,"In order to accommodate the growing amounts of integrated renewable production, including wind and solar PV, energy networks are undergoing significant adjustments. In recent years, the growth of renewable energy sources (RES) has been greatly accelerated thanks to the privatization and deregulation of the energy industry, as well as financial incentives and energy policy measures. As decentralized energy generation is developed through residential and commercial PV applications, a new position described as an energy prosumer is produced. The traditional division between energy users and producers is eliminated as a result. Blockchain technology automate direct energy transactions inside a distributed system architecture based on consensus-based verification and cryptographic hashing, providing utilities, prosumers, and consumers with a one-of-a-kind, cost-effective, and secure energy-trading system. The objective of this project is to implement a general ABM simulation framework for energy exchange and demonstrate the operation of any blockchain process as well as the expected power profiles of homes. A robust multi-agent structure was constructed and simulated for a Transactive Energy (TE) type Distributed Energy Resources (DER) within the ECCH microgrid that is dependent on blockchain engineering. Auction systems are used in recent blockchain-based LEM plans to balance supply and demand in the future. These blockchain-based LEMs rely on accurate short-term forecasts of the energy generation and consumption of particular homes as a consequence. Such accurate estimations are usually only assumed. In the present study, this assumption was tested by first evaluating the forecast accuracy that can be obtained for particular families using state-of-the-art energy forecasting methods, and then by examining the effects of prediction mistakes on market outcomes in three alternative supply scenarios. The evaluation showed that an LSTM model may provide rather little predicting errors. The prediction process will be modified to fit the design of a blockchain-based LEM. Because of this, the current study differs greatly from past investigations that make a thorough effort to predict the time sequence of smart meters generally."

10.1109/ICNP61940.2024.10858566,SatFlow: Scalable Network Planning for LEO Mega-Constellations,"Low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite communication networks have evolved into mega-constellations with hundreds to thousands of satellites inter-connecting with inter-satellite links (ISLs). Network planning, which plans for network resources and architecture to improve the network performance and save operational costs, is crucial for satellite network management. However, due to the large scale of mega-constellations, high dynamics of satellites, and complex distribution of real-world traffic, it is extremely challenging to conduct scalable network planning on mega-constellations with high performance. In this paper, we propose SATFLOW, a distributed and hierarchical network planning framework to plan for the network topology, traffic allocation, and fine-grained ISL terminal power allocation for mega-constellations. To tackle the hardness of the original problem, we decompose the grand problem into two hierarchical sub-problems, tackled by two-tier modules. A multi-agent reinforcement learning approach is proposed for the upper-level module so that the overall laser energy consumption and ISL operational costs can be minimized; A distributed alternating step algorithm is proposed for the lower-level module so that the laser energy consumption could be minimized with low time complexity for a given topology. Extensive simulations on various mega-constellations validate SATFLOW's scalability on the constellation size, reducing the flow violation ratio by up to $21.0 \%$ and reducing the total costs by up to $89.4 \%$, compared with various state-of-the-art benchmarks."

10.1109/ICONS62911.2024.00052,Mimicking Associative Learning of Rats via a Neuromorphic Robot in Open Field Maze Using Spatial Cell Models,"Data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have exhibited remarkable prowess across various cognitive tasks using extensive training data. However, the reliance on large datasets and neural networks presents challenges such as high-power consumption and limited adaptability, particularly in SWaP-constrained applications like planetary exploration. To address these issues, we propose enhancing the autonomous capabilities of intelligent robots by emulating the associative learning observed in animals. Associative learning enables animals to adapt to their environment by memorizing concurrent events. By replicating this mechanism, neuromorphic robots can navigate dynamic environments autonomously, learning from interactions to optimize performance. This paper explores the emulation of associative learning in rodents using neuromorphic robots within open-field maze environments, leveraging insights from spatial cells such as place and grid cells. By integrating these models, we aim to enable online associative learning for spatial tasks in real-time scenarios, bridging the gap between biological spatial cognition and robotics for advancements in autonomous systems."
10.1109/ICORR66766.2025.11063193,Brain Biomarkers for Assessing Practice of Robotic Arm Reaching Movements Using a Head-Controlled Interface,"Limited efforts have examined the cognitive-motor processes as individuals learn to operate upper-limb assistive devices that improve interactions in their environment (e.g., prostheses, head-controlled devices). Prior work mainly focused on performance without examining cerebral cortical dynamics via brain biomarkers to assess the level of practice during the learning of such assistive devices. Specifically, it was suggested that EEG biomarkers like low- and high-beta spectral power are related to learning as they assess memory formation and attentional mechanisms. Therefore, this work examines how sensorimotor performance, and low-/high-beta spectral power are influenced as individuals without disabilities practice reaching movements with a simulated robotic effector executed via a head-controlled interface. Results revealed faster and straighter reaching movements. Additionally, as individuals progressed from early to late practice, the movement planning stage revealed an elevation of frontal, central and parietal low-beta power and an attenuation of high-beta power in the temporal region. These spectral modulations may reflect an internal model memory encoding process of the novel sensorimotor mapping imposed by this interface throughout practice which ultimately enables improved reaching performance. This work could inform patients' cognitive-motor processes when learning to control assistive systems and provide biomarkers for monitoring practice during rehabilitation."

However, in unprecedented situations, the functionality of the MAPE-K loop often degrades, limiting its effectiveness. Moreover, In robotic applications, a distributed MAPE-K loop may be necessary for enabling adaptability across diverse deployment environments. To address this challenge, we propose a novel robotic software architecture designed to enhance trustworthiness, modularity and portability within the MAPE-K framework.

This paper constructs a multi-agent, multi-objective, and multi-layer micro-grid collaborative planning model that comprehensively considers the transmission of multi-layer optimization problems based on the different objectives of multiple entities such as micro grid operators.

10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9196657,Backlash-Compensated Active Disturbance Rejection Control of Nonlinear Multi-Input Series Elastic Actuators,"Series elastic actuators with passive compliance have been gaining increasing popularity in force-controlled robotic manipulators. One of the reasons is the actuator's ability to infer the applied torque by measuring the deflection of the elastic element as opposed to directly with dedicated torque sensors. Proper deflection control is pinnacle to achieve a desired output torque and, therefore, small deviances in positional measurements or a nonlinear deformation can have adverse effects on performance. In applications with larger torque requirements, the actuators typically use gear reductions which inherently result in mechanical backlash. This combined with the nonlinear behaviour of the elastic element and unmodelled dynamics, can severely compromise force fidelity.This paper proposes a backlash compensating active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) for multi-input series elastic actuators. In addition to proper deflection control, a multiinput active disturbance rejection controller is derived and implemented experimentally to mitigate any unmodelled nonlinearities or perturbations to the plant model. The controller is experimentally validated on a hybrid motor-brake-clutch series elastic actuator and the controller performance is compared against traditional error-based controllers. It is shown that the backlash compensated ADRC outperforms classical PID and ADRC methods and is a viable solution to positional measurement error in elastic actuators."

We developed tools to approximate reachable sets using polytopes and perform sampling-based planning with them. This method has a unique advantage in hybrid systems: different dynamic modes in the reachable set can be explicitly represented using multiple polytopes. We prove that under mild assumptions, R3T is probabilistically complete in kinodynamic systems, and asymptotically optimal through rewiring. Moreover, R3T provides a formal verification method for reachability analysis of nonlinear systems. The advantages of R3T are demonstrated with case studies on nonlinear, hybrid, and contact-rich robotic systems."
10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9197274,Iterator-Based Temporal Logic Task Planning,"Temporal logic task planning for robotic systems suffers from state explosion when specifications involve large numbers of discrete locations. We provide a novel approach, particularly suited for task specifications with universally quantified locations, that has constant time with respect to the number of locations, enabling synthesis of plans for an arbitrary number of them. We propose a hybrid control framework that uses an iterator to manage the discretised workspace hiding it from a plan enacted by a discrete event controller. A downside of our approach is that it incurs in increased overhead when executing a synthesised plan. We demonstrate that the overhead is reasonable for missions of a fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle in simulated and real scenarios for up to 700000 locations."
10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9197409,Accurate Vision-based Manipulation through Contact Reasoning,"Planning contact interactions is one of the core challenges of many robotic tasks. Optimizing contact locations while taking dynamics into account is computationally costly and, in environments that are only partially observable, executing contact-based tasks often suffers from low accuracy. We present an approach that addresses these two challenges for the problem of vision-based manipulation. First, we propose to disentangle contact from motion optimization. Thereby, we improve planning efficiency by focusing computation on promising contact locations. Second, we use a hybrid approach for perception and state estimation that combines neural networks with a physically meaningful state representation. In simulation and real-world experiments on the task of planar pushing, we show that our method is more efficient and achieves a higher manipulation accuracy than previous vision-based approaches."

The proposed approach takes into account geometric constraints related to the desired task, like for example the direction to approach the final target and the presence of moving obstacles. The developed motion planner is structured as a two-layer architecture: a global level computes smooth spline-based trajectories that are continuously updated using virtual potential fields; a local level, exploiting Dynamical Systems based obstacle avoidance, ensures collision free connections among the spline control points. The proposed architecture is validated in a realistic surgical scenario."
10.1109/ICRA46639.2022.9811566,ReDUCE: Reformulation of Mixed Integer Programs Using Data from Unsupervised Clusters for Learning Efficient Strategies,"Mixed integer convex and nonlinear programs, MICP and MINLP, are expressive but require long solving times. Recent work that combines learning methods on solver heuristics has shown potential to overcome this issue allowing for applications on larger scale practical problems. Gathering sufficient training data to employ these methods still present a challenge since getting data from traditional solvers are slow and newer learning approaches still require large amounts of data. In order to scale up and make these hybrid learning approaches more manageable we propose ReDUCE, a method that exploits structure within small to medium size datasets. We also introduce the bookshelf organization problem as an MINLP as a way to measure performance of solvers with ReDUCE. Results show that existing algorithms with ReDUCE can solve this problem within a few seconds, a significant improvement over the original formulation. ReDUCE is demonstrated as a high level planner for a robotic arm for the bookshelf problem."

10.1109/ICRA46639.2022.9812086,Combining Planning and Learning of Behavior Trees for Robotic Assembly,"Industrial robots can solve tasks in controlled environments, but modern applications require robots able to operate also in unpredictable surroundings. An increasingly popular reactive policy architecture in robotics is Behavior Trees (BTs) but as other architectures, programming time drives cost and limits flexibility. The two main branches of algorithms to generate policies automatically, automated planning and machine learning, both have their own drawbacks and have not previously been combined for generation of BTs. We propose a method for creating BTs by combining these branches, inserting the result of an automated planner into the population of a Genetic Programming algorithm. Experiments confirm that the proposed method performs well on a variety of robotic assembly problems and outperforms the base methods used separately. We also show that this high level learning of Behavior Trees can be transferred to a real system without further training."
10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561209,Continuous Optimization-Based Task and Motion Planning with Signal Temporal Logic Specifications for Sequential Manipulation,"We propose a new optimization-based task and motion planning (TAMP) with signal temporal logic (STL) specifications for robotic sequential manipulation such as pick-and-place tasks. Given a high-level task specification, the TAMP problem is to plan a trajectory that satisfies the specification. This is, however, a challenging problem due to the difficulty of combining continuous motion planning and discrete task specifications. The optimization-based TAMP with temporal logic specifications is a promising method, but existing works use mixed integer problems (MIP) and do not scale well. To address this issue, in our approach, a new hybrid system model without discrete variables is introduced and combined with smooth approximation methods for STL. This allows the TAMP to be formulated as a nonlinear programming problem whose computational cost is significantly less than that of MIP. Furthermore, it is also possible to deal with nonlinear dynamics and geometric constraints represented by nonlinear functions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with both numerical experiments and a real robot."

Recent advances in video to command provide an end-to-end approach to translate a video into robot plans. However, the general video captioning methods focus more on the understanding of the full frame, while they lack the consideration of the spatio-temporal features in videos. In this paper, we proposed the two-stream 2D/3D residual networks for robots to learn manipulation tasks from human demonstration videos. We integrate spatial features with 2D residual network and temporal features with 3D residual network as inputs for RNN layers. An encoder-decoder architecture is then used to encode the spatio-temporal features and sequentially generate the command words. Experimental results on an extended manipulation dataset show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Real-world experiments results on a Baxter robotic arm indicate that our method could produce more accurate commands from video demonstrations."
10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561391,"Learning to Rearrange Deformable Cables, Fabrics, and Bags with Goal-Conditioned Transporter Networks","Rearranging and manipulating deformable objects such as cables, fabrics, and bags is a long-standing challenge in robotic manipulation. The complex dynamics and high-dimensional configuration spaces of deformables, compared to rigid objects, make manipulation difficult not only for multi-step planning, but even for goal specification. Goals cannot be as easily specified as rigid object poses, and may involve complex relative spatial relations such as ""place the item inside the bag"". In this work, we develop a suite of simulated benchmarks with 1D, 2D, and 3D deformable structures, including tasks that involve image-based goal-conditioning and multi-step deformable manipulation. We propose embedding goal-conditioning into Transporter Networks, a recently proposed model architecture for learning robotic manipulation that rearranges deep features to infer displacements that can represent pick and place actions. We demonstrate that goal-conditioned Transporter Networks enable agents to manipulate deformable structures into flexibly specified configurations without test-time visual anchors for target locations. We also significantly extend prior results using Transporter Networks for manipulating deformable objects by testing on tasks with 2D and 3D deformables.

10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561556,Trajectory Optimization for Manipulation of Deformable Objects: Assembly of Belt Drive Units,"This paper presents a novel trajectory optimization formulation to solve the robotic assembly of the belt drive unit. Robotic manipulations involving contacts and deformable objects are challenging in both dynamic modeling and trajectory planning. For modeling, variations in the belt tension and contact forces between the belt and the pulley could dramatically change the system dynamics. For trajectory planning, it is computationally expensive to plan trajectories for such hybrid dynamical systems as it usually requires planning for discrete modes separately. In this work, we formulate the belt drive unit assembly task as a trajectory optimization problem with complementarity constraints to avoid explicitly imposing contact mode sequences. The problem is solved as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC) to obtain feasible and efficient assembly trajectories. We validate the proposed method both in simulations with a physics engine and in real-world experiments with a robotic manipulator."

Most prior robotic guiding systems are based on wheeled platforms with large bases with actuated rigid guiding canes. The large bases and the actuated arms limit these prior approaches from operating in narrow and cluttered environments. We propose a method that introduces a quadrupedal robot with a leash to enable the robot-guidinghuman system to change its intrinsic dimension (by letting the leash go slack) in order to fit into narrow spaces. We propose a hybrid physical Human Robot Interaction model that involves leash tension to describe the dynamical relationship in the robot-guiding-human system. This hybrid model is utilized in a mixed-integer programming problem to develop a reactive planner that is able to utilize slack-taut switching to guide a blind-folded person to safely travel in a confined space. The proposed leash-guided robot framework is deployed on a Mini Cheetah quadrupedal robot and validated in experiments (Video 1)

Various processes in this field can benefit from the proper use of state of the art technology [1], in terms of efficiency as well as quality. One of these areas is the harvesting of ripe fruit.In order to be able to automate this process, a robotic harvester needs to be aware of the full poses of the crop/fruit to be collected in order to perform proper path- and collision-planning. The current state of the art mainly considers problems of detection and segmentation of fruit with localisation limited to the 3D position only. The reliable and real-time estimation of the respective orientations remains a mostly unaddressed problem.In this paper, we present a compact and efficient network architecture for estimating the orientation of soft fruit such as strawberries from colour and, optionally, depth images. The proposed system can be automatically trained in a realistic simulation environment. We evaluate the system’s performance on simulated datasets and validate its operation on publicly available images of strawberries to demonstrate its practical use. Depending on the amount of training data used, coverage of state space, as well as the availability of RGB-D or RGB data only, mean errors of as low as 11° could be achieved."

This work proposes a novel telemanipulation architecture using a passive Fractal Impedance Controller (FIC), which does not depend upon an active viscous component for guaranteeing stability. Compared to a traditional impedance controller in ideal conditions (no delays and maximum communication bandwidth), our proposed method yields higher transparency in interaction and demonstrates superior dexterity and capability in our telemanipulation test scenarios. We also validate its performance with extreme delays up to 1 s and communication bandwidths as low as 10 Hz. All results validate a consistent stability when using the proposed controller in challenging conditions, regardless of operator expertise."

These abilities have been mostly lacking in robots, sometimes making them appear awkward and socially inept. Here we propose an end-to-end long-term visual prediction framework for robots to begin to acquire both these critical cognitive skills, known as Visual Perspective Taking (VPT) and Theory of Behavior (TOB). We demonstrate our approach in the context of visual hide-and-seek – a game that represents a cognitive milestone in human development. Unlike traditional visual predictive model that generates new frames from immediate past frames, our agent can directly predict to multiple future timestamps (25 s), extrapolating by 175% beyond the training horizon. We suggest that visual behavior modeling and perspective taking skills will play a critical role in the ability of physical robots to fully integrate into real-world multi-agent activities."

Concretely, we craft an adaptive agent system, which we call active predictive coding (ActPC), that balances an internally-generated epistemic signal (meant to encourage intelligent exploration) with an internally-generated instrumental signal (meant to encourage goal-seeking behavior) to learn how to control various simulated robotic systems as well as a complex robotic arm using a realistic simulator, i.e., the Surreal Robotics Suite, for the block lifting task and the can pick-and-place problem. Notably, our results demonstrate that the proposed ActPC agent performs well in the face of sparse (extrinsic) reward signals and is competitive with or outperforms several powerful backpropagation-based reinforcement learning approaches."
10.1109/ICRA48891.2023.10160545,Learning Neuro-symbolic Programs for Language Guided Robot Manipulation,"Given a natural language instruction and an input scene, our goal is to train a model to output a manipulation program that can be executed by the robot. Prior approaches for this task possess one of the following limitations: (i) rely on hand-coded symbols for concepts limiting generalization beyond those seen during training [1] (ii) infer action sequences from instructions but require dense sub-goal supervision [2] or (iii) lack semantics required for deeper object-centric reasoning inherent in interpreting complex instructions [3]. In contrast, our approach can handle linguistic as well as perceptual variations, end-to-end trainable and requires no intermediate supervision. The proposed model uses symbolic reasoning constructs that operate on a latent neural object-centric representation, allowing for deeper reasoning over the input scene. Central to our approach is a modular structure consisting of a hierarchical instruction parser and an action simulator to learn disentangled action representations. Our experiments on a simulated environment with a 7-DOF manipulator, consisting of instructions with varying number of steps and scenes with different number of objects, demonstrate that our model is robust to such variations and significantly outperforms baselines, particularly in the generalization settings.

Leveraging the massive computing power of the cloud and low-latency connectivity to the edge can compensate for this lack of computing resources. However, this introduces a new challenge related to the deployment of complex robotic software across multiple devices, especially in a large-scale system. This paper presents KubeROS, a unified and fully managed platform for automated deployment of robotic applications developed on top of Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2), in a hybrid computing infrastructure with robots, edge and cloud. KubeROS uses Kubernetes from Cloud Native Computing as its underlying software orchestration framework. It aims to help researchers and developers with no prior cloud computing knowledge deploy their ROS2-based robotic applications at any scale. KubeROS eliminates the need for system configuration and network setup. We demonstrate the applicability of KubeROS by deploying a fleet of simulated mobile manipulators in a clas-sical pick-and-place application. The experiments demonstrate the effects of different deployment strategies for vision-based motion planning under different fleet sizes and workloads. In addition, KubeROS improves task performance by using high-performance computing at the edge and in the cloud, and achieves high resource efficiency when using the shared deployment strategy."

While many efforts focus on generating collision-free reference signals, few allow safe contact between the robot bodies and the environment. However, in human's daily manipulation, contact between arms and obstacles is prevalent and even necessary. This paper investigates the benefit of allowing safe contact during robotic manipulation and advocates generating and tracking compliance reference signals in both operational and null spaces. In addition, to optimize the collision-allowed trajectories, we present a hybrid solver that integrates sampling- and gradient-based approaches. We evaluate the proposed method on a goal-reaching task in five simulated and real-world environments with different collisional conditions. We show that allowing safe contact improves goal-reaching efficiency and provides feasible solutions in highly collisional scenarios where collision-free constraints cannot be enforced. Moreover, we demonstrate that planning in null space, in addition to operational space, improves trajectory safety. Further information is available at https://rolandzhu.github.io/ContactReach/."
10.1109/ICRA48891.2023.10160887,Learning Feasibility of Factored Nonlinear Programs in Robotic Manipulation Planning,"A factored Nonlinear Program (Factored-NLP) explicitly models the dependencies between a set of continuous variables and nonlinear constraints, providing an expressive formulation for relevant robotics problems such as manipulation planning or simultaneous localization and mapping. When the problem is over-constrained or infeasible, a fundamental issue is to detect a minimal subset of variables and constraints that are infeasible. Previous approaches require solving several nonlinear programs, incrementally adding and removing constraints, and are thus computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a graph neural architecture that predicts which variables and constraints are jointly infeasible. The model is trained with a dataset of labeled subgraphs of Factored-NLPs, and importantly, can make useful predictions on larger factored nonlinear programs than the ones seen during training. We evaluate our approach in robotic manipulation planning, where our model is able to generalize to longer manipulation sequences involving more objects and robots, and different geometric environments. The experiments show that the learned model accelerates general algorithms for conflict extraction (by a factor of 50) and heuristic algorithms that exploit expert knowledge (by a factor of 4)."

More recently, beyond waypoint planning, problems involving significant components of (visual) high-level reasoning have been explored in simulated environments, mostly addressed with large-scale machine learning, in particular RL, offline-RL or imitation learning. These methods require the agent to learn various skills like local planning, mapping objects and querying the learned spatial representations. In contrast to simpler tasks like waypoint planning (PointGoal), for these more complex tasks the current state-of-the-art models have been thoroughly evaluated in simulation but, to our best knowledge, not yet in real environments. In this work we focus on sim2real transfer. We target the challenging Multi-Object Navigation (Multi-ON) task [41] and port it to a physical environment containing real replicas of the originally virtual Multi-ON objects. We introduce a hybrid navigation method, which decomposes the problem into two different skills: (1) waypoint navigation is addressed with classical SLAM combined with a symbolic planner, whereas (2) exploration, semantic mapping and goal retrieval are dealt with deep neural networks trained with a combination of supervised learning and RL. We show the advantages of this approach compared to end-to-end methods both in simulation and a real environment and outperform the SOTA for this task [28]. © 2023 IEEE."
10.1109/ICRA48891.2023.10161243,TrafficBots: Towards World Models for Autonomous Driving Simulation and Motion Prediction,"Data-driven simulation has become a favorable way to train and test autonomous driving algorithms. The idea of replacing the actual environment with a learned simulator has also been explored in model-based reinforcement learning in the context of world models. In this work, we show data-driven traffic simulation can be formulated as a world model. We present TrafficBots, a multi-agent policy built upon motion prediction and end-to-end driving, and based on TrafficBots we obtain a world model tailored for the planning module of autonomous vehicles. Existing data-driven traffic simulators are lacking configurability and scalability. To generate configurable behaviors, for each agent we introduce a destination as nav-igational information, and a time-invariant latent personality that specifies the behavioral style. To improve the scalability, we present a new scheme of positional encoding for angles, allowing all agents to share the same vectorized context and the use of an architecture based on dot-product attention. As a result, we can simulate all traffic participants seen in dense urban scenarios. Experiments on the Waymo open motion dataset show TrafficBots can simulate realistic multi-agent behaviors and achieve good performance on the motion prediction task."

However, layout estimation using point clouds (PCs) still suffers from data scarcity due to annotation difficulty. As such, we address the semi-supervised setting of this task based upon the idea of model exponential moving averaging. But adapting this scheme to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solution for PC-based layout estimation is not straightforward. To this end, we define a quad set matching strategy and several consistency losses based upon metrics tailored for layout quads. Besides, we propose a new online pseudo-label harvesting algorithm that decomposes the distribution of a hybrid distance measure between quads and PC into two components. This technique does not need manual threshold selection and intuitively encourages quads to align with reliable layout points. Surprisingly, this framework also works for the fully-supervised setting, achieving a new SOTA on the ScanNet benchmark. Last but not least, we also push the semi-supervised setting to the realistic omni-supervised setting, demonstrating significantly promoted performance on a newly annotated ARKitScenes testing set. Our codes, data and models are made publicly available**Code: https://github.com/AIR-DISCOVER/Omni-PQ."

We first generate over 650K cluttered scenes-orders of magnitude more than prior work-in diverse everyday environments, such as cabinets and shelves. We render synthetic partial point clouds from this data and use it to train our CabiNet model architecture. CabiNet is a collision model that accepts object and scene point clouds, captured from a single-view depth observation, and predicts collisions for SE(3) object poses in the scene. Our representation has a fast inference speed of 7μs/query with nearly 20% higher performance than baseline approaches in challenging environments. We use this collision model in conjunction with a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) planner to generate collision-free trajectories for picking and placing in clutter. CabiNet also predicts waypoints, computed from the scene's signed distance field (SDF), that allows the robot to navigate tight spaces during rearrangement. This improves rearrangement performance by nearly 35% compared to baselines. We systematically evaluate our approach, procedurally generate simulated experiments, and demonstrate that our approach directly transfers to the real world, despite training exclusively in simulation. Supplementary material and videos of robot experiments in completely unknown scenes are available at: cabinet-object-rearrangement.github.io."
10.1109/ICRA55743.2025.11127480,Closed Loop Interactive Embodied Reasoning for Robot Manipulation,"Embodied reasoning systems integrate robotic hardware and cognitive processes to perform complex tasks, typically in response to a natural language query about a specific physical environment. This usually involves changing the belief about the scene or physically interacting and changing the scene (e.g. sort the objects from lightest to heaviest). In order to facilitate the development of such systems we introduce a new modular Closed Loop Interactive Embodied Reasoning (CLIER) approach that takes into account the measurements of non-visual object properties, changes in the scene caused by external disturbances as well as uncertain outcomes of robotic actions. CLIER performs multi-modal reasoning and action planning and generates a sequence of primitive actions that can be executed by a robot manipulator. Our method operates in a closed loop, responding to changes in the environment. Our approach is developed with the use of MuBle simulation environment and tested in $\mathbf{1 0}$ interactive benchmark scenarios. We extensively evaluate our reasoning approach in simulation and in real-world manipulation tasks with a success rate above $\mathbf{7 6 \%}$ and 64%, respectively."

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising framework for agent collaboration, but it faces difficulties in handling complex tasks and designing reward functions. The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought stronger reasoning and cognitive abilities to MAS, but existing LLM-based systems struggle to respond quickly and accurately in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-based Graph Collaboration MARL (LGC-MARL), a framework that efficiently combines LLMs and MARL. This framework decomposes complex tasks into executable subtasks and achieves efficient collaboration among multiple agents through graph-based coordination. Specifically, LGC-MARL consists of two main components: an LLM planner and a graph-based collaboration meta policy. The LLM planner transforms complex task instructions into a series of executable subtasks, evaluates the rationality of these subtasks using a critic model, and generates an action dependency graph. The graph-based collaboration meta policy facilitates communication and collaboration among agents based on the action dependency graph, and adapts to new task environments through meta-learning. Experimental results on the AI2-THOR simulation platform demonstrate the superior performance and scalability of LGC-MARL in completing various complex tasks."

Given the complex, non-linear, anisotropic material properties of the mushrooms in combination with the multiple failure-mode modalities involved, we design a simulation framework around the PyBullet rigid-body-physics engine by utilizing first-order approximations of the equivalent continuum mechanics models. By exploiting the computational efficiency of the aforementioned simulation framework, we directly apply the MPPI control framework to generate offline optimal mushroom uprooting motion primitives, defining a set of cost objectives for an optimal and within-constraint harvesting plan. We show that with this planning strategy, the “root-bending” action emerges autonomously for the case of a single mushroom as an optimal uprooting maneuver, which corresponds well to empirical knowledge obtained by expert pickers. A video demonstration of the proposed architecture can be found in https://youtu.be/k38ePBsBego."

These planned trajectories must be both kinematically feasible (i.e., collision free) and dynamically feasible (i.e., satisfy the underlying system dynamics), necessitating a consideration of both the free space and the dynamics of the robot in the path planning phase. In this work, we explore the application of reachable Bézier polytopes as an efficient tool for generating trajectories satisfying both kinematic and dynamic requirements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by offloading specific computation tasks to the GPU, such an algorithm can meet tight real time requirements. We propose a layered control architecture that efficiently produces collision free and dynamically feasible paths for nonlinear control systems, and demonstrate the framework on the tasks of 3D hopping in a cluttered environment."

In this system, the Passenger robots execute tasks while the Mothership provides support. This paper addresses the challenge of planning Passenger robot movements, framing it as a Stochastic Multi-Agent Orienteering Problem (SMOP) complicated by factors like stochastic operational efforts and disruptive events. We optimize the task completion efficiency of the system by combining centralized solutions from the Mothership with local plans from Passengers to enhance system resilience. Our contributions include defining the SMOP, developing a solution using Decentralized Monte Carlo Tree Search, presenting a hybrid algorithm that integrates centralized plans into the distributed framework, and evaluating the algorithm's performance in a simulated environment. Our results show that our hybrid approaches outperform fully centralized and fully distributed algorithms in highly-dynamic scenarios with up to a 26.6 % increase in task completion efficiency over baseline methods."

Meanwhile, LLM-based approaches, which are grounded in artificial neural networks, offer faster inference and commonsense reasoning but suffer from lower success rates. To address the limitations of the current symbolic (slow speed) or LLM-based approaches (low accuracy), we propose a novel neuro-symbolic task planner that decomposes complex tasks into subgoals using LLM and carries out task planning for each subgoal using either symbolic or MCTS-based LLM planners, depending on the subgoal complexity. This decomposition reduces planning time and improves success rates by narrowing the search space and enabling LLMs to focus on more manageable tasks.

This task requires complex reasoning, such as determining whether it is possible to turn left into a specific lane. To address this challenge, we introduce neuro-symbolic methods powered by vision-language foundation models (VLMs). Existing approaches have notable limitations: (1) Dense visual prompting with VLMs can achieve strong performance but is costly in terms of both financial resources and carbon footprint, making it impractical for robotics applications. (2) Neuro-symbolic reasoning methods for 3D scene understanding fail to integrate visual inputs when synthesizing programs, making them ineffective in handling complex corner cases. To this end, we propose a fast-slow neuro-symbolic lane topology extraction algorithm, named Chameleon, which alternates between a fast system that directly reasons over detected instances using synthesized programs and a slow system that utilizes a VLM with a chain-of-thought design to handle corner cases. Chameleon leverages the strengths of both approaches, providing an affordable solution while maintaining high performance. We evaluate the method on the OpenLane-V2 dataset, showing consistent improvements across various baseline detectors.

As a vehicle navigates at the limit of its capabilities over extreme terrain, its dynamics can change suddenly and dramatically. For example, varying terrain can affect parameters such as traction, tire slip, and rolling resistance. To achieve effective planning in such environments, it is crucial to have a dynamics model that can accurately anticipate these conditions and respond before an issue can occur. In this work, we present a hybrid model that predicts the changing dynamics induced by the terrain as a function of visual inputs. We leverage a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) DINOv2, which provides rich features that encodes fine-grained semantic information. To use this dynamics model for planning, we propose an end-to-end training architecture for a projection distance independent feature encoder that compresses the information from the VFM, enabling the creation of a lightweight map of the environment at runtime. We validate our architecture on an extensive dataset (hundreds of kilometers of aggressive off-road driving) collected across multiple locations as part of the DARPA Robotic Autonomy in Complex Environments with Resiliency (RACER) program. https://youtu.be/aydHxLGmnx8"

Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound reconstruction and new view image synthesis, which can assist in diagnosis and reexamine, have significant potential in teleultrasound, especially integrating robotic ultrasound systems (RUSS). Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), an impressive reconstruction method, requires long training times, limiting its practicality in ultrasound. Despite NeRF variants achieving faster optimization, their performance remains confined to natural scene reconstructions. To address this limitation, we propose HFUS-NeRF, a hybrid representation method designed for fast and accurate ultrasound reconstruction. HFUS-NeRF integrates multi-resolution hash-grid and tri-plane representations to represent each sampling point of the ultrasonic wave. A unified model for sampling points from different ultrasonic probes is presented to simulate the wave's propagation through tissues, and the final ultrasound image is rendered using volume rendering. Compared with NeRF-based ultrasound reconstruction, both the hash grid and triplane resolutions can be scaled up more efficiently, improving reconstruction speed. Experimental results demonstrate that HFUS-NeRF enhances reconstruction quality while significantly reducing reconstruction time to mere minutes. Furthermore, we validated HFUS-NeRF's adaptability by reconstruction using images from different types of ultrasound probes, and real-world experiments confirmed its feasibility and transferability, enabling fast ultrasound reconstruction on human subjects."

The MAPF community has largely focused on developing high-performance heuristic search methods. Recently, several works have applied various machine learning (ML) techniques to solve MAPF, usually involving sophisticated architectures, reinforcement learning techniques, and set-ups, but none using large amounts of high-quality supervised data. Our initial objective in this work was to show how simple large-scale imitation learning of high-quality heuristic search methods can lead to state-of-the-art ML MAPF performance. However, we find that, at least with our model architecture, simple large-scale (700k examples with hundreds of agents per example) imitation learning does not produce impressive results. Instead, we find that by using prior work that post-processes MAPF model predictions to resolve 1-step collisions (CS-PIBT), we can train a simple ML MAPF policy in minutes that dramatically outperforms existing ML MAPF policies. This has serious implications for all future ML MAPF policies (with local communication) which currently struggle to scale. In particular, this finding implies that future learnt policies should always (1) use smart 1-step collision shields (e.g, CS-PIBT) and (2) include the collision shield with greedy actions as a baseline (e.g. PIBT), as well as (3) motivates future models to focus on longer horizon / more complex planning as 1-step collisions can be efficiently resolved."

Indeed, the stochastic nature of the underlying environment dynamics makes it an interesting research field for statistical learning approaches and neural policies. In this work, we introduce a novel attention-based neural architecture capable of solving a smoothing task for such objects by means of a single robotic arm. To train our network, we leverage an oracle policy, executed in simulation, which uses the topological description of a mesh of points for representing the object to smooth. In a second step, we transfer the resulting behavior in the real world with imitation learning using the cloth point cloud as decision support, which is captured from a single RGBD camera placed egocentrically on the wrist of the arm. This approach allows fast training of the real-world manipulation neural policy while not requiring scene reconstruction at test time, but solely a point cloud acquired from a single RGBD camera. Our resulting policy first predicts the desired point to choose from the given point cloud and then the correct displacement to achieve a smoothed cloth. Experimentally, we first assess our results in a simulation environment by comparing them with an existing heuristic policy, as well as several baseline attention architectures. Then, we validate the performance of our approach in a real-world scenario. Project website: link"

Building on the foundation of Fractal Impedance Control (FIC) introduced in our previous work, this paper presents a novel extension to dualarm tele-cooperation, leveraging the non-linear stiffness and passivity of FIC to adapt to diverse cooperative scenarios. Unlike traditional impedance controllers, our approach ensures stability without relying on energy tanks, as demonstrated in our prior research. In this paper, we further extend the FIC framework to bimanual operations, allowing for stable and smooth switching between different dynamic tasks without gain tuning. We also introduce a telemanipulation architecture that offers higher transparency and dexterity, addressing the challenges of signal latency and low-bandwidth communication. Through extensive experiments, we validate the robustness of our method and the results confirm the advantages of the FIC approach over traditional impedance controllers, showcasing its potential for applications in planetary exploration and other scenarios requiring dexterous telemanipulation. This paper’s contributions include the seamless integration of FIC into multi-arm systems, the ability to perform robust interactions in highly variable environments, and the provision of a comprehensive comparison with competing approaches, thereby significantly enhancing the robustness and adaptability of robotic systems."

Addressing this imperative, this study contributes to the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to task and motion planning for robots. We propose a system architecture that orchestrates a seamless interplay between multiple cognitive levels, encompassing reasoning, planning, and motion generation. At its core lies a novel replanning strategy that handles physically grounded, logical, and semantic errors in the generated plans. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed feedback architecture, particularly its impact on executability, correctness, and time complexity via empirical evaluation in the context of a simulation and two intricate real-world scenarios: blocks world, barman and pizza preparation."
10.1109/ICRA57147.2024.10610676,Scalable Multi-Robot Collaboration with Large Language Models: Centralized or Decentralized Systems?,"A flurry of recent work has demonstrated that pre-trained large language models (LLMs) can be effective task planners for a variety of single-robot tasks. The planning performance of LLMs is significantly improved via prompting techniques, such as in-context learning or re-prompting with state feedback, placing new importance on the token budget for the context window. An under-explored but natural next direction is to investigate LLMs as multi-robot task planners. However, long-horizon, heterogeneous multi-robot planning introduces new challenges of coordination while also pushing up against the limits of context window length. It is therefore critical to find token-efficient LLM planning frameworks that are also able to reason about the complexities of multi-robot coordination. In this work, we compare the task success rate and token efficiency of four multi-agent communication frameworks (centralized, decentralized, and two hybrid) as applied to four coordination-dependent multi-agent 2D task scenarios for increasing numbers of agents. We find that a hybrid framework achieves better task success rates across all four tasks and scales better to more agents. We further demonstrate the hybrid frameworks in 3D simulations where the vision-to-text problem and dynamical errors are considered. See our project website 4 for prompts, videos, and code."

Existing methods based on closed-loop deep reinforcement learning rely on external models for termination evaluation. To achieve more effective grasp for novel objects, we propose a new autonomous grasp control scheme termed HAGrasp that considers the complete point cloud of the workspace. It integrates grasp pose estimation, end-effector pose evaluation, and motion planning of the robotic arm into a single model, enhancing the success rate while reducing computational load. We present a closed-loop grasp control system based on deep reinforcement learning. This control system can perform grasp tasks while dynamically adjusting to avoid end-effector collisions. The design of hybrid-action reinforcement learning module is trained with unified latent action space and further improve generalization, achieving real-time autonomous grasp control. Real robot experiments show that our method has 74.2% success rate for grasping 7 unseen objects. Comparative experiments show that the proposed HAGrasp outperforms open-loop baseline Contact-Graspnet in both success rate and inference time. It is demonstrated that with integrated multi-view input and sim-to-real training design, our method improves real-world applications of autonomous grasp."

In this work, these global tibia kinematics define a phase variable impedance controller (PVIC), which is implemented as the nonvolitional base controller within a hybrid volitional control framework (PVI-HVC). The gait progression estimation and biomechanic performance of one able-bodied individual walking on a robotic ankle prosthesis via a bypass adapter are compared for three control schemes: benchmark passive controller, PVIC, and PVI-HVC. The different actuation of each had a direct effect on the global tibia kinematics, but the average deviation between the estimated and ground truth gait percentages were 1.6%, 1.8%, and 2.1%, respectively, for each controller. Both PVIC and PVI-HVC produced good agreement with able-bodied kinematic and kinetic references. As designed, PVI-HVC results were similar to those of PVIC when the user used low volitional intent, but yielded higher peak plantarflexion, peak torque, and peak power when the user commanded high volitional input in late stance. This additional torque and power also allowed the user to volitionally and continuously achieve activities beyond level walking, such as ascending ramps, avoiding obstacles, standing on tip-toes, and tapping the foot. In this way, PVI-HVC offers the kinetic and kinematic performance of the PVIC during level ground walking, along with the freedom to volitionally pursue alternative activities."

However, this approach poses a significant challenge when attempting to modify or adjust the loads within a single training set. This paper introduces an innovative method for achieving adjustable loads during resistance training by leveraging physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI). The primary objective is to regulate targeted muscle activation through the use of Robo-Coach (robotic coach system). We first utilize a Task-Parameterized Gaussian Mixture Model (TP-GMM) to learn the motion of coach demonstration, which can be generalized for the trainees. The 3D path extracted from the generated trajectory is then projected onto a 2D plane with respect to the direction of the load. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid stiffness/position generator for online task execution. This generator determines the desired positions in the 2D plane according to the contact point displacements in the stimuli direction and, simultaneously, sets the desired stiffness based on the muscle activation feedback. Finally, the Robo-Coach is implemented with a variable impedance controller to achieve load-adjustable resistance training with the trainee. The biceps curl exercises were conducted and the results showed favorable performance, indicating the effectiveness of this approach."
10.1109/ICRA57147.2024.10611301,ALPHA: Attention-based Long-horizon Pathfinding in Highly-structured Areas,"The multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problem seeks collision-free paths for a team of agents from their current positions to their pre-set goals in a known environment, and is an essential problem found at the core of many logistics, transportation, and general robotics applications. Existing learning-based MAPF approaches typically only let each agent make decisions based on a limited field-of-view (FOV) around its position, as a natural means to fix the input dimensions of its policy network. However, this often makes policies shortsighted, since agents lack the ability to perceive and plan for obstacles/agents beyond their FOV. To address this challenge, we propose ALPHA, a new framework combining the use of ground truth proximal (local) information and fuzzy distal (global) information to let agents sequence local decisions based on the full current state of the system, and avoid such myopicity. We further allow agents to make short-term predictions about each others’ paths, as a means to reason about each others’ path intentions, thereby enhancing the level of cooperation among agents at the whole system level. Our neural structure relies on a Graph Transformer architecture to allow agents to selectively combine these different sources of information and reason about their inter-dependencies at different spatial scales. Our simulation experiments demonstrate that ALPHA outperforms both globally-guided MAPF solvers and communication-learning based ones, showcasing its potential towards scalability in realistic deployments."
10.1109/ICRA57147.2024.10611334,Recency Bias in Task Performance History Affects Perceptions of Robot Competence and Trustworthiness,"Human memory of a robot’s competence, and resulting subjective perceptions of that robot, are influenced by numerous cognitive biases. One class of cognitive bias deals with the ordering of items or interactions: information presented last among a grouping is most salient in memory formation (recency bias), followed by information presented first (primacy bias), followed by information in the middle, collectively known as the serial-position effect. For example, if a human’s last observation of a robot involves a task failure, this will disproportionately negatively alter their perception of the robot’s competence, as well as their trust in the robot moving forward. It is valuable to characterize the effect of these biases within human-robot interactions to inform strategies for risk-aware planning that cultivate appropriate levels of human trust. We conducted a human-subjects study (n=53) testing the influence of the serial-position effect on recalled competence (see overview at https://youtu.be/BgH2zhh1s48). Participants viewed videos of a robot performing the same tasks at the same level of competence, with task order differing by experimental condition (rising competence, falling competence, or failures at the midpoint), asking participants to rate robot competence in between every video as well at the very end of the experiment. We found that while the average between-video rating of robot competence remained stable across conditions, the recalled, post-experiment ratings of competence and trust were significantly lower in the condition with decreasing competence than in either of the other two conditions, suggesting a notable recency bias. We conclude with implications for human-subjects experiment design (i.e., how subjective measures are influenced by ordering effects) and provide design recommendations to minimize them. We further discuss practical applications of these results in creating risk-aware robotic planners capable of trust calibration."
10.1109/ICRA57147.2024.10611347,Unknown Object Grasping for Assistive Robotics,"We propose a novel pipeline for unknown object grasping in shared robotic autonomy scenarios. State-of-the-art methods for fully autonomous scenarios are typically learning-based approaches optimised for a specific end-effector, that generate grasp poses directly from sensor input. In the domain of assistive robotics, we seek instead to utilise the user’s cognitive abilities for enhanced satisfaction, grasping performance, and alignment with their high level task-specific goals. Given a pair of stereo images, we perform unknown object instance segmentation and generate a 3D reconstruction of the object of interest. In shared control, the user then guides the robot end-effector across a virtual hemisphere centered around the object to their desired approach direction. A physics-based grasp planner finds the most stable local grasp on the reconstruction, and finally the user is guided by shared control to this grasp. In experiments on the DLR EDAN platform, we report a grasp success rate of 87% for 10 unknown objects, and demonstrate the method’s capability to grasp objects in structured clutter and from shelves."
10.1109/ICRA57147.2024.10611461,Enhancing Task Performance of Learned Simplified Models via Reinforcement Learning,"In contact-rich tasks, the hybrid, multi-modal nature of contact dynamics poses great challenges in model representation, planning, and control. Recent efforts have attempted to address these challenges via data-driven methods, learning dynamical models in combination with model predictive control. Those methods, while effective, rely solely on minimizing forward prediction errors to hope for better task performance with MPC controllers. This weak correlation can result in data inefficiency as well as limitations to overall performance. In response, we propose a novel strategy: using a policy gradient algorithm to find a simplified dynamics model that explicitly maximizes task performance. Specifically, we parameterize the stochastic policy as the perturbed output of the MPC controller, thus, the learned model representation can directly associate with the policy or task performance. We apply the proposed method to contact-rich tasks where a three-fingered robotic hand manipulates previously unknown objects. Our method significantly enhances task success rate by up to 15% in manipulating diverse objects compared to the existing method while sustaining data efficiency. Our method can solve some tasks with success rates of 70% or higher using under 30 minutes of data. All videos and codes are available at https://sites.google.com/view/lcs-rl."

The challenging aspect is the analytic representation of collision cost for the case when both the obstacle map and robot footprint are arbitrary. We propose a Neural Potential Field: a neural network model that returns a differentiable collision cost based on robot pose, obstacle map, and robot footprint. The differentiability of our model allows its usage within the MPC solver. It is computationally hard to solve problems with a very high number of parameters. Therefore, our architecture includes neural image encoders, which transform obstacle maps and robot footprints into embeddings, which reduce problem dimensionality by two orders of magnitude. The reference data for network training are generated based on algorithmic calculation of a signed distance function.

One uniqueness lies in that both control and tracking of the arterial robotic ultrasound end-effector have been implemented to improve performance. Firstly, the magnetic catheter model and hybrid visual/force servoing control scheme of the extracorporeal ultrasound-integrated tracking arm (EUTA) are derived based on the interaction Jacobian matrix and impedance modeling. Meanwhile, we implement a tracking method of in-plane ultrasound catheter’s tip and detection of vascular boundaries utilizing intensity-level iterative Hough-transform with Iterative End-Ponit Fitting (IEPF).

The development of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT) enable real-world manufacturing systems and their cyber world to form a manufacturing-oriented Cyber-Physical Systems - Cyber-Physical Manufacturing Systems (CPMS). However, the low performance of the edge, and the heavy storage and computing burden of the cloud, cannot meet the fast and accurate requirements of CPMS. To address these issues, this paper proposes an cloud-edge collaboration architecture of Cyber-Physical Manufacturing Systems intended for industrial robots collaboration. In the architecture, the key planning and decision are placed at a central computing station and the trivial calculation tasks are placed at the information shell of the manufacturing equipment. Specifically, robotic arms, AGVs and other manufacturing nodes are designed to store and perceive the environment and self-state, run with basic kinematics and kinetics. Reconfigurable computing nodes based on FPGA performs trivial logical calculation tasks. The manufacturing could is designed to plan and control all holonic nodes based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. The collaboration between robotic arm and AGV is studied as a case.

Conditional planning extends the classical planning framework to account for plans under partial observability. We use a hybrid conditional planning approach to compute plans that include sensing and actuation actions in solving real-world problems by addressing uncertainties due to incomplete information at the planning phase. We generate a hybrid conditional plan of actions using parallel instances of a non-monotonic hybrid HCPLAN that supports defaults, integration of external computations, and non-deterministic actions.

Nevertheless, it is still difficult to control tensegrity robots because of their unconventional designs and highly coupled dynamics. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms have been used in a lot of robotic tasks due to their strong perception and decision-making capabilities. However, it often needs to collect a lot of samples, which limits its application. Model-based algorithms can learn with fewer samples but have a sub-optimal result because of the model error. In the paper, we proposed a hybrid method to achieve effective control of tensegrity robots. Firstly, we established the simulation platform via the framework of the positional formulation finite element method. And thens, we use a medium-sized neural network to fit the dynamic model and control the tensegrity robot via model prediction control (MPC). The controlled trajectories are used to initialize the parameters and memory of deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG).

10.1109/ICRoM64545.2024.10903654,Dynamic Analysis of a Quasi-serial Planar Manipulator with Spring and Counterweight Gravity Compensation Considering Joint Reaction Forces,"Quasi-serial mechanisms with a serial-parallel hybrid structure play an important role in modern industrial robotics for heavy-load and high-speed applications due to their efficient, high-throughput capabilities. Gravity compensation is one of the most effective ways to optimize such mechanisms for better energy efficiency and for reducing the strain of the actuators involved. Spring-based gravity compensation can effectively reduce both the motor torque and energy consumption but is subjected to degradation over time and requires maintenance. Alternatively, counterweight compensation offers consistent performance but at the cost of higher structural loads on mechanical links. Most studies primarily focus on motor torques, often overlooking the joint reaction forces encountered along the manipulator's designed paths within the workspace. This paper presents a dynamic model for a planar quasi-serial mechanism considering joint reaction forces. Derivations are first made for a compensation-free system, yielding 12 force and moment equations for all the links, with 12 unknowns. After that, spring and counterweight compensations are added, and new dynamic equations are derived. Motor torques and joint forces are examined under three conditions: no compensation, spring compensation, and counterweight compensation. Theoretical models are verified by MSC Adams simulations, highlighting the importance of understanding joint forces to assess the internal stresses and loads on each link during operation. This analysis is essential for optimizing component sizing and material selection, ensuring durability and reliability under extreme industrial use. Accurate joint force analysis reduces maintenance by preventing mechanical failures, enhancing performance and lifetime by providing practical insight into the most efficient gravity compensation methodology used in robotic systems."

This necessitates the development of robust data center management platforms capable of self-management. To make these systems adaptable to new uncertainties, especially in space, underwater, and remote data centers aimed at long-running or mission-critical operations, the architectures of these robust data center management platforms need to be accurately modeled to be dynamic and evolve during execution. We argue that, in addition to making systems self-managing and autonomous, there is a need for a human-centric adaptive architecture in the data center management domain. This involves incorporating human-in-the-loop mechanisms to oversee the system's self-adaptation and control anomalies and other drifting pointers that could affect the system's quality attributes. This paper also introduces AI Agents in the self-managing system, which can further enhance autonomous management flexibility by enabling dynamic system architecture changes through these agentic “digital workers.“ We propose a dynamic architecture framework combining AI Agents and Human-in-the-Loop for continuously improving data center management. The architecture expands the MAPE-K loop by introducing human-in-the-loop at the Plan phase and AI Agents at the Execute phase to enhance the dynamic architecture setup for autonomous self-managing data centers.

Such a cooperation can be achieved efficiently by solving a path planning problem. On top of solving a path planning problem, the problem of routing an heterogeneous set of vehicles in an optimal fashion is quite challenging. In order to solve the computationally expensive path-planning problem in a reasonable time, we created a two-level optimization approach with heuristics. At the outer level, the UGV route is parameterized by considering which set of locations to visit in the scenario and the UGV wait times to recharge UAVs and at the inner level, the UAV route is solved by formulating and solving a vehicle routing problem with capacity constraints, time windows, and dropped visits. The UGV free parameters need to be optimized judiciously in order to create high quality solutions. We explore two methods for tuning the free UGV parameters: (1) a Genetic Algorithm (GA), and (2) Asynchronous Multi-agent architecture (A-teams).

This paper proposes a multi-agent collaborative closed-loop planning-evaluation framework, an LLM-driven, closed-loop optimization pipeline for task planning and feasibility auditing aimed at robust planning in complex, dynamic settings. The framework adopts a layered architecture with three LLM-based agents: a planning agent, an evaluation (validation) agent, and an assessment agent. Using a unified geometric-semantic-constraint representation, the planner generates symbolic task sequences, maps them to a predefined skill library, and performs self-checks to revise plans. The evaluation agent audits plans against preset criteria, outputs feasibility judgments and corrective suggestions, and iterates with the planner until a feasible solution is obtained. A fine-tuned assessment agent produces quantitative scores by combining task completion, efficiency, and replanning penalties, forming a human preference-aligned evaluation system. Experiments on mobile manipulation in household scenarios show task success rates of 96.9% (simple short tasks), 87.4% (simple long tasks), and $72.4 \%$ (complex long tasks), substantially improving over classical symbolic planning (PDDL) and Chain-of-Thought-guided LLM baselines.

Subsequently, through the integration of the reference path and nearest neighbor search, the surface trajectories are generated. These trajectories can be transformed to align with the robot’s coordinate for grinding process. Furthermore, a Mask R-CNN network architecture, rooted in deep learning instance segmentation, was formulated to detect defects on the surface of each propeller blade. With the implementation of the defect detection model, the system is required to grind only the surface areas that exhibit defects."

However, creating these agentic applications require substantial user effort, involving model selection, prompt engineering and guardrails. There are also limitation in deploying these applications on cloud platforms. In this early work, we take a step towards addressing these limitations by proposing an intuitive pattern comprising of a planner, executor, evaluator and judge agents to compose these as agentic workflows with simple prompt specifications. We also propose to model these as Function as a Service (FaaS) workflows on public/private clouds to simplify their deployment and outsourcing their orchestration. A preliminary implementation of our AgentX platform provides Python modules for these roles, which are used to compose AWS Step Functions. Our initial results on local machine and AWS using Open AI and Claude show promise in simpler compositions, but also expose challenges due to diverse behavior of LLMs. As future work, we will explore the use of our XFaaS hybrid cloud orchestration platform to deploy these on hybrid public/private clouds to leverage cost arbitrage, and offer flexible and automated selection of model to trade-off latency, accuracy and reliability."

The approach leverages the MATD3 algorithm, which features an architecture with two sets of Critic networks to mitigate the issue of overestimation in reinforcement learning. Additionally, an LSTM network is integrated to address the inefficiency in utilizing time-series information in sample data, guiding UGV clusters to achieve global mission objectives without relying on explicit environmental maps. Furthermore, to expedite neural network training for UGV clusters in unknown environments, the paper employs Pybullet to simulate unknown environments. Subsequently, this paper compares this algorithm with MADDPG and MATD3 methods, demonstrating that our proposed approach outperforms navigation tasks within unknown environments. UGV clusters utilizing LSTM-MATD3 achieve higher cumulative rewards and success rates, along with lower cluster collision rates. Experimental results affirm the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed method."

10.1109/IRC.2020.00029,Hierarchical Planner with Composable Action Models for Asynchronous Parallelization of Tasks and Motions,"Task and motion planning is a relevant yet hard to solve problem in robotic manipulation. Large number of degrees of freedom with multiple manipulators and several objects require specialized algorithms, which can deal with the hybrid planning and optimization problem. An additional challenge is the asynchronous parallelization of single robot actions on interacting manipulators. In this paper we propose a system with a hierarchical planner, which solves the task and motion problem and optimizes for a subsequent parallelization. We use action models based on a constraint formulation; thus, the execution engine can parallelize the sequential plan without synchronization between different tasks. In the experiment, we solve a task and motion problem with difficult geometric constraints and combinatorial complexity. The asynchronously parallel execution of that plan is demonstrated on a real world dual-arm robot."
10.1109/IRCE66030.2025.11203139,Multi-Agent Path Planning and Optimization Using Q-learning,"Path planning and optimization play an important role in robotics and autonomous multi-agent systems, especially in cluttered 2D environments with strict smoothness and clearance requirements. This paper introduces a novel twophase hybrid framework combining reinforcement learning and convex optimization to generate diverse, smooth, and collision-free paths. The first phase, which constitutes the core contribution, employs a Q-learning-based method on a visibility graph to learn an adaptive policy that generalizes across multiple start-goal pairs and varying environmental complexities. This approach enables path diversity, robust obstacle avoidance, and environment-specific adaptation without relying on hand-crafted heuristics. The second phase refines these initial trajectories using Multi-agent Interleaving Convex Optimization (MICO) to improve curvature, length, and clearance. Experimental results demonstrate that MICO outperforms baseline convex optimization methods and provides flexible tuning of path characteristics through multiobjective optimization. The paths are represented as piecewise Bézier curves, ensuring smooth and feasible motion for multi-agent navigation."
10.1109/IRIA53009.2021.9588669,A robust tactile sensor matrix for intelligent grasping of objects using robotic grippers,"Intelligent power grasp of robotic gripper system has been instrumental in metal-working industries as well as handling of nuclear material in recent past. Slip-resistant, robust gripping of disc-shaped material during remote manipulation is a challenge in material handling. In a nuclear fuel manufacturing lab, sensitive fuel materials (objects) are handled in the form of a disc (melt) that is pre-cast. Depending on the process treatment, the metal discs are categorized as delicate, hard or soft. The metal discs that were handled by the robotic system and used in the experiment have a diameter of 60mm, a thickness of 15mm, and a weight of 2.3 kg., It is crucial to take care of the paradigms like grip force, profile and perception of slide for job planning and management of a robot in a hazardous radioactive environment. A multi-sensory tactile array is designed indigenously and fabricated by utilising commercial sensors attached to the prototype gripper so as to make it an intelligent instrumented-jaw gripper. The custom-built tactile sensory system is made up of a) force sensing resistors (FSRs) in a specific array, b) a matrix of FSR in the centre, c) PVDF (Polyvinylidene Fluoride) sensors in the perimeter and d) infrared (IR) sensors placed in a predetermined architecture. The mounting of the customized gripper sensory system includes a 3x2-array of FSRs and other sensors, each having a spatial resolution of 5 mm and a sensing area of $15,000 mm^{2}$. While PVDF sensor is employed for dynamic contact point estimation, texture recognition is accomplished using high frequency response. An integrated form of proximity and ambient light sensor is utilised (mimicing distance sensor) to detect the presence of an object and improve gripper alignment during grasping. This sensor-instrumented processing was achieved through microcontroller-based programming and allied electronics, such as scanning the array & storing the data. LabView® was used to record the digital signals and analysis of time-spanned raw data. Calibration was carried out to ensure that the acquired data was repeatable and reliable. The paradigms of indigenous development of the integrated sensory system for the gripper as well as its calibration, dynamic features and response characteristics are discussed in this paper. The tactile matrix has a force range of 30N, a resolution of 0.3N and a sensitivity of 0.5V/N., The FSR sensors produced a nonlinear relationship at various force ranges and the hysteresis therein was found to vary with load range and frequency. At lower frequencies of 0.2 and 0.8 Hz, cycle drift was significant, with a maximum inaccuracy in force value of 0.5 N. The force measuring inaccuracy of normal force was less than 5% at sensitive places. Based on the repeated experimentation, the developed matrix sensor was entrusted to have nearly 95% accuracy rate in recognising different textures. The developed tactile sensor matrix was found to be robust and it has good reproducibility in parameters like contact force measurement, contact point estimate, slip detection and texture recognition, according to the experimental results. To not withstanding benefits the developed tactile sensor system was also comprehended with few on-job limitations, signaling run-time error conditions."

The linear feedback control mechanism is not sufficient to control vehicle maneuver with precision, thus it summons research of adaptive control approach. An adaptive control strategy is most often deployed to control system with unknown plant model or a system with minimal information. The objective of the proposed hybrid control strategy is to deal with non-linearity in the actuation system with minimum tuning effort. An iterative back-stepping mechanism is used to design model reference adaptive control to aid vehicle maneuver. The aim of this paper is to analysis the stability of non-linear lateral dynamics through iterative back-stepping. The proposed controller performance meets the expectation of functionality while driving within the designed system constraints of lateral motion dynamics. This research work deals with the erratic system which remains unstable whenever value of reference signal becomes reasonably high. The adjustable parameters provided in the control input signal of adaptive lateral control aids to control such abrupt changes in motion dynamics specifically in multiple curvature road. The hybrid approach of model reference adaptive lateral control aided with linear heading control is designed in MATLAB and validated in virtual platform of Carmaker. The complex road structure has been modeled in Carmaker to aid in simulation-based testing of lateral control with vehicle model in loop. The performance of model substantiates the efficacy and robustness of proposed control mechanism."
10.1109/IROS45743.2020.9340749,Learning Hybrid Object Kinematics for Efficient Hierarchical Planning Under Uncertainty,"Sudden changes in the dynamics of robotic tasks, such as contact with an object or the latching of a door, are often viewed as inconvenient discontinuities that make manipulation difficult. However, when these transitions are well-understood, they can be leveraged to reduce uncertainty or aid manipulation-for example, wiggling a screw to determine if it is fully inserted or not. Current model-free reinforcement learning approaches require large amounts of data to learn to leverage such dynamics, scale poorly as problem complexity grows, and do not transfer well to significantly different problems. By contrast, hierarchical POMDP planning-based methods scale well via plan decomposition, work well on novel problems, and directly consider uncertainty, but often rely on precise hand-specified models and task decompositions. To combine the advantages of these opposing paradigms, we propose a new method, MICAH, which given unsegmented data of an object's motion under applied actions, (1) detects changepoints in the object motion model using action-conditional inference, (2) estimates the individual local motion models with their parameters, and (3) converts them into a hybrid automaton that is compatible with hierarchical POMDP planning. We show that model learning under MICAH is more accurate and robust to noise than prior approaches. Further, we combine MICAH with a hierarchical POMDP planner to demonstrate that the learned models are rich enough to be used for performing manipulation tasks under uncertainty that require the objects to be used in novel ways not encountered during training."
10.1109/IROS45743.2020.9341070,Risk-Averse MPC via Visual-Inertial Input and Recurrent Networks for Online Collision Avoidance,"In this paper, we propose an online path planning architecture that extends the model predictive control (MPC) formulation to consider future location uncertainties for safer navigation through cluttered environments. Our algorithm combines an object detection pipeline with a recurrent neural network (RNN) which infers the covariance of state estimates through each step of our MPC's finite time horizon. The RNN model is trained on a dataset that comprises of robot and landmark poses generated from camera images and inertial measurement unit (IMU) readings via a state-of-the-art visualinertial odometry framework. To detect and extract object locations for avoidance, we use a custom-trained convolutional neural network model in conjunction with a feature extractor to retrieve 3D centroid and radii boundaries of nearby obstacles. The robustness of our methods is validated on complex quadruped robot dynamics and can be generally applied to most robotic platforms, demonstrating autonomous behaviors that can plan fast and collision-free paths towards a goal point."

Social sciences suggest that the best explanations are contrastive, explaining not just why one action is taken, but why one action is taken instead of another. We formalize the notion of contrastive explanations for robotic planning policies based on Markov decision processes, drawing on insights from the social sciences. We present methods for the automated generation of contrastive explanations with three key factors: selectiveness, constrictiveness and responsibility. The results of a user study with 100 participants on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform show that our generated contrastive explanations can help to increase users' understanding and trust of robotic planning policies, while reducing users' cognitive burden."

We fuse two sensory modalities, i.e., the raw visual inputs from the RGB camera and the tactile cues from our specific tactile sensor without any extra sensor calibrations. The robotic system is well controlled and adjusted based on the estimation model in real time. The main contributions and novelties of our work are listed as follows: 1) Explore a proprioceptive way for liquid volume estimation by developing an end-to-end predictive model with multi-modal convolutional networks, which achieve a high precision with an error of ~ 2 ml in the experimental validation. 2) Propose a multi-task learning architecture which comprehensively considers the losses from both classification and regression tasks, and comparatively evaluate the performance of each variant on the collected data and actual robotic platform. 3) Utilize the proprioceptive robotic system to accurately serve and control the requested volume of liquid, which is continuously flowing into a deformable container in real time. 4) Adaptively adjust the grasping plan to achieve more stable grasping and manipulation according to the real-time liquid volume prediction."

In this work, we address these challenges with Neuro-Symbolic Relational Transition Models (NSRTs), a novel class of models that are data-efficient to learn, compatible with powerful robotic planning methods, and generalizable over objects. NSRTs have both symbolic and neural components, enabling a bilevel planning scheme where symbolic AI planning in an outer loop guides continuous planning with neural models in an inner loop. Experiments in four robotic planning domains show that NSRTs can be learned very data-efficiently, and then used for fast planning in new tasks that require up to 60 actions and involve many more objects than were seen during training."
10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981488,A Hierarchical Deliberative Architecture Framework based on Goal Decomposition,"Performing a complex autonomous mission with a multi-robot system requires to integrate several deliberative approaches to perform task allocation, optimization, and execution control. Implementing such a deliberative architecture is a complex task: it requires the developer to master the decision algorithms themselves (e.g., automated planning models), to have a good knowledge of the involved robotic platforms, and to think about how these elements will be assembled as a system architecture. We propose a framework to help designing such deliberative architectures. The framework relies on the concept of a hierarchical structure of actors, each actor managing goals with specific planning or optimization approaches, and delegating sub-goals to other actors."
10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981499,GE-Grasp: Efficient Target-Oriented Grasping in Dense Clutter,"Grasping in dense clutter is a fundamental skill for autonomous robots. However, the crowdedness and oc-clusions in the cluttered scenario cause significant difficul-ties to generate valid grasp poses without collisions, which results in low efficiency and high failure rates. To address these, we present a generic framework called GE-Grasp for robotic motion planning in dense clutter, where we leverage diverse action primitives for occluded object removal and present the generator-evaluator architecture to avoid spatial collisions. Therefore, our GE-Grasp is capable of grasping objects in dense clutter efficiently with promising success rates. Specifically, we define three action primitives: target-oriented grasping for target capturing, pushing, and nontarget-oriented grasping to reduce the crowdedness and occlusions. The gen-erators effectively provide various action candidates referring to the spatial information. Meanwhile, the evaluators assess the selected action primitive candidates, where the optimal action is implemented by the robot. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods of grasping in clutter with respect to motion efficiency and success rates. Moreover, we achieve comparable performance in the real world as that in the simulation environment, which indicates the strong gen-eralization ability of our GE-Grasp.

Research shows that an important precursor to the development of these abilities in humans is Theory of Mind (ToM) - the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and to others. In this work, we endow robots with ToM abilities and propose a ToM-based approach to proactive robotic assistance by appealing to epistemic planning techniques. Our evaluation shows that robots implementing our approach and demonstrating ToM are measurably more helpful and perceived by humans as more socially intelligent compared to robots with a deficit in ToM."
10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9635900,A Multimodal and Hybrid Framework for Human Navigational Intent Inference,"Understanding human navigational intent is essential for robots to be able to interact with and navigate around humans safely and naturally. Current methods typically perform inference through only one mode of perception such as human motion trajectory, and a single theoretical framework such as a learning-based or classical approach. In contrast, this paper studies prediction of human navigational intent using multimodal perception within a hybrid framework. Our framework consists of two modules: a) a learning-based prediction module to predict a human’s future goal position, and b) a classical control theory-inspired reconstruction module to reconstruct a possible future trajectory or a set of possible future positions using the predicted future goal position. For the prediction module, we propose an end-to-end LSTM-CNN hybrid neural network for predicting a human’s future position in the real world, given human motion, human body pose and head orientation. This visual information from an egocentric perspective is used to make predictions of a human’s future position in world space, essential for robotic navigation algorithms and planning. In the reconstruction module, we present two control theoretic methods to reconstruct possible future trajectories of human: trajectory generation for differentially flat system and reachability analysis. We evaluate the performance of our framework on a newly collected dataset called SFU-Store-Nav. Experimental results reveal that our method outperforms various baselines especially when a relatively small amount of data is available."
10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9635941,Learning Symbolic Operators for Task and Motion Planning,"Robotic planning problems in hybrid state and action spaces can be solved by integrated task and motion planners (TAMP) that handle the complex interaction between motion-level decisions and task-level plan feasibility. TAMP approaches rely on domain-specific symbolic operators to guide the task-level search, making planning efficient. In this work, we formalize and study the problem of operator learning for TAMP. Central to this study is the view that operators define a lossy abstraction of the transition model of a domain. We then propose a bottom-up relational learning method for operator learning and show how the learned operators can be used for planning in a TAMP system. Experimentally, we provide results in three domains, including long-horizon robotic planning tasks. We find our approach to substantially outperform several baselines, including three graph neural network-based model-free approaches from the recent literature. Video: https://youtu.be/iVfpX9BpBRo.

The development of performant controllers and motion plans for these systems commonly requires time-consuming iterations on hardware. We present the SoMo (Soft Motion) toolkit, a software framework that makes it easy to instantiate and control typical continuum manipulators in an accurate physics simulator. SoMo introduces a standardized and human-readable description format for continuum manipulators. It leverages this description format and the Bullet physics engine to enable fast and accurate simulations of soft and soft-rigid hybrid robots in environments with complex contact interactions. This allows users to vary design and control parameters across simulations with minimal effort. We compare the capabilities of SoMo to other physics simulators and highlight the benefits and accuracy of SoMo by demonstrating the agreement between simulation and real-world experiments on several examples; these include an in-hand manipulation task with continuum fingers, an automated exploration of how to design soft fingers for precision grasping, and a brief snake locomotion study. Overall, SoMo provides an accessible way for designers of soft robotic hardware and control systems to gain access to a simulation-accelerated workflow."
10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636386,Attention Augmented ConvLSTM for Environment Prediction,"Safe and proactive planning in robotic systems generally requires accurate predictions of the environment. Prior work on environment prediction applied video frame prediction techniques to bird’s-eye view environment representations, such as occupancy grids. ConvLSTM-based frameworks used previously often result in significant blurring of the predictions, loss of static environment structure, and vanishing of moving objects, thus hindering their applicability for use in safety-critical applications. In this work, we propose two extensions to the ConvLSTM architecture to address these issues. We present the Temporal Attention Augmented ConvLSTM (TAAConvLSTM) and Self-Attention Augmented ConvLSTM (SAAConvLSTM) frameworks for spatiotemporal occupancy grid prediction, and demonstrate improved performance over baseline architectures on the real-world KITTI and Waymo datasets.

A two-layer planning architecture is proposed that leverages both the environment map and the direct depth sensor information to ensure maximal information gain out of the onboard sensors. A frontier-based pose sampling technique is used with a fast marching cost-to-go calculation to select a goal pose and plan a path to maximize robot exploration rate. An artificial potential function approach, relying on direct depth measurements, enables the robot to follow the path while simultaneously avoiding small scene obstacles that are not captured in the map due to mapping and localization uncertainties. We demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the proposed approach through field deployments in a structurally complex warehouse using a micro-aerial vehicle (MAV) with all the sensing and computations performed onboard."
10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636603,Efficient Computation of Map-scale Continuous Mutual Information on Chip in Real Time,"Exploration tasks are essential to many emerging robotics applications, ranging from search and rescue to space exploration. The planning problem for exploration requires determining the best locations for future measurements that will enhance the fidelity of the map, for example, by reducing its total entropy. A widely-studied technique involves computing the Mutual Information (MI) between the current map and future measurements, and utilizing this MI metric to decide the locations for future measurements. However, computing MI for reasonably-sized maps is slow and power hungry, which has been a bottleneck towards fast and efficient robotic exploration. In this paper, we introduce a new hardware accelerator architecture for MI computation that features a low-latency, energy-efficient MI compute core and an optimized memory subsystem that provides sufficient bandwidth to keep the cores fully utilized. The core employs interleaving to counter the recursive algorithm, and workload balancing and numerical approximations to reduce latency and energy consumption. We demonstrate this optimized architecture with a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation, which can compute MI for all cells in an entire 201-by-201 occupancy grid (e.g., representing a 20.1m-by-20.1m map at 0.1m resolution) in 1.55 ms while consuming 1.7 mJ of energy, thus finally rendering MI computation for the whole map real time and at a fraction of the energy cost of traditional compute platforms. For comparison, this particular FPGA implementation running on the Xilinx Zynq-7000 platform is two orders of magnitude faster and consumes three orders of magnitude less energy per MI map compute, when compared to a baseline GPU implementation running on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 platform. The improvements are more pronounced when compared to CPU implementations of equivalent algorithms."

We present Risk-Averse Nonlinear Steering RRT* (RANS-RRT*) as an RRT* variant that incorporates nonlinear dynamics by solving a nonlinear program (NLP) and accounts for risk by approximating the state distribution and performing a distributionally robust (DR) collision check to promote safe planning. The generated plan is used as a reference for a low-level tracking controller. We demonstrate three controllers: finite horizon linear quadratic regulator (LQR) with linearized dynamics around the reference trajectory, LQR with robustness-promoting multiplicative noise terms, and a nonlinear model predictive control law (NMPC).

In order to achieve an efficient human-robot collaboration (HRC), it is important to have an integration between a proper task scheduling strategy and a task execution strategy. The first must deal with the variability of the two agents, while the second must deal with the safety standards. In this paper, we propose an integrated architecture for task scheduling and execution in a collaborative cell. The tasks are dynamically scheduled handling the uncertainity in both the human and the robot behaviors. Subsequently, at the execution level, the task is accomplished computing trajectories comply with the safety regulations. The planning information are mutually integrated in real-time with the scheduling procedure in order improve the HRC."
10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10341651,A Data-Driven Approach to Synthesizing Dynamics-Aware Trajectories for Underactuated Robotic Systems,"We consider joint trajectory generation and tracking control for under-actuated robotic systems. A common solution is to use a layered control architecture, where the top layer uses a simplified model of system dynamics for trajectory generation, and the low layer ensures approximate tracking of this trajectory via feedback control. While such layered control architectures are standard and work well in practice, selecting the simplified model used for trajectory generation typically relies on engineering intuition and experience. In this paper, we propose an alternative data-driven approach to dynamicsaware trajectory generation. We show that a suitable augmented Lagrangian reformulation of a global nonlinear optimal control problem results in a layered decomposition of the overall problem into trajectory planning and feedback control layers. Crucially, the resulting trajectory optimization is dynamicsaware, in that, it is modified with a tracking penalty regularizer encoding the dynamic feasibility of the generated trajectory. We show that this tracking penalty regularizer can be learned from system rollouts for independently-designed low layer feedback control policies, and instantiate our framework in the context of a unicycle and a quadrotor control problem in simulation. Further, we show that our approach handles the sim-to-real gap through experiments on the quadrotor hardware platform without any additional training. For both the synthetic unicycle example and the quadrotor system, our framework shows significant improvements in both computation time and dynamic feasibility in simulation and hardware experiments."
10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10341747,ITIRRT: A Decoupled Framework for the Integration of Machine Learning Into Path Planning,"Machine learning models have been successfully applied in many separate domains in the recent years. Yet, there is still a large disconnect with the path planning community mainly due to implementation difficulty. In this paper, we identify the issues and present a path planning framework that aims to ease the integration of machine learning models. The framework is divided into two phases: prediction and planning. During the prediction phase machine learning models are used to predict a path solution which, while not perfect, is enough to jump-start our proposed planner. The planning phase begins with the initialization of multiple independent tree data structures and, during execution, our planner merges the different trees until a path is found. Due to the architecture of our framework, the prediction and the planning phases are totally decoupled, resulting in a planner that treats the information given by the prediction model as a guess and not as a path to be corrected. This also allows our planner to maintain its probabilistic completeness. Our planner was evaluated on simulated environments and on a small robotic arm. We show that our planner can successfully leverage predicted paths to significantly improve the planning performances. We also demonstrate the flexibility of our framework by integrating multiple machine learning models of varying complexity."

The CAMETA framework consists of three components: a path planning layer generating potential path suggestions, a multi-agent ETA prediction layer predicting the arrival times for all agents based on the paths, and lastly, a path selection layer that calculates the accumulated cost and selects the best path. The novelty of the CAMETA framework lies in the heterogeneous map representation and the heterogeneous graph neural network architecture. As a result of the proposed novel structure, CAMETA improves the generalization capability compared to the state-of-the-art methods that rely on structured road infrastructure and historical data. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the multi-agent ETA prediction layer, with a mean average percentage error improvement of 29.5% and 44% when compared to a traditional path planning method (A *) which does not consider conflicts. The performance of the CAMETA framework shows significant improvements in terms of robustness to noise and conflicts as well as determining proficient routes compared to state-of-the-art multi-agent path planners."
10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10342010,Spatial Reasoning via Deep Vision Models for Robotic Sequential Manipulation,"In this paper, we propose using deep neural architectures (i.e., vision transformers and ResNet) as heuristics for sequential decision-making in robotic manipulation problems. This formulation enables predicting the subset of objects that are relevant for completing a task. Such problems are often addressed by task and motion planning (TAMP) formulations combining symbolic reasoning and continuous motion planning. In essence, the action-object relationships are resolved for discrete, symbolic decisions that are used to solve manipulation motions (e.g., via nonlinear trajectory optimization). However, solving long-horizon tasks requires consideration of all possible action-object combinations which limits the scalability of TAMP approaches. To overcome this combinatorial complexity, we introduce a visual perception module integrated with a TAMP-solver. Given a task and an initial image of the scene, the learned model outputs the relevancy of objects to accomplish the task. By incorporating the predictions of the model into a TAMP formulation as a heuristic, the size of the search space is significantly reduced. Results show that our framework finds feasible solutions more efficiently when compared to a state-of-the-art TAMP solver. © 2023 IEEE."

However, the expensive computing and storage associated with networks impose significant challenges for their deployment on low-cost robots. Motivated by this practical challenge, we develop a lightweight neural path planning architecture with a dual input network and a hybrid sampler for resource-constrained robotic systems. Our architecture is designed with efficient task feature extraction and fusion modules to translate the given planning instance into a guidance map. The hybrid sampler is then applied to restrict the planning within the prospective regions indicated by the guide map. To enable the network training, we further construct a publicly available dataset with various successful planning instances. Numerical simulations and physical experiments demonstrate that, compared with baseline approaches, our approach has nearly an order of magnitude fewer model size and five times lower computational while achieving promising performance. Besides, our approach can also accelerate the planning convergence process with fewer planning iterations compared to sample-based methods."
10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10342148,"Toward Closed-Loop Additive Manufacturing: Paradigm Shift in Fabrication, Inspection, and Repair","Increased usage of additive manufacturing (AM) in various industries has solidified its role as an advanced manufacturing technique. However, there is an inherent lack of reliability in AM processes, particularly common in extrusion or deposition-based methods due to the stochastic nature of ma-terial deposition. This necessitates an intelligent manufacturing solution to address the drawbacks of AM. Thus, we propose a novel layer-wise approach toward closed-loop AM, which is capable of in-situ monitoring and repairing geometric defects. In this paper, we present a system that uses a robotic AM experimental platform that mimics a conventional open-loop fabrication setup, which we augment into a closed-loop system using two add-ons: in-situ inspection subsystem and online process correction subsystem. The in-situ inspection subsystem collects 3D point cloud scans and compares them against a reference CAD model, categorizing geometric deviations as positive or negative defects. Then the subsequent online process correction subsystem uses a re-plan and/or repair strategy to address the positive and/or negative defects, respectively. To evaluate this idea, we conducted three experiments on parts with manually induced defects to investigate the system's ability to repair those parts, thereby reducing defects, improving part accuracy, and enhancing mechanical properties. Comparing the defective and repaired parts, we observe a reduction in defect percent by volume from 10.7% to 1.3%, an improvement in geometric tolerance from 3.86% error to 0.08% error, and an increase in the part's breaking load from 4.77 kN to 6.31 kN. These experiments prove that our layer-wise closed-loop additive manufacturing approach improves the quality, tolerance, and reliability of plastic 3D printed parts, with the potential to extend to other extrusion/deposition-based AM processes, or even subtractive manufacturing and hybrid manufacturing methods."

While the framework can be applied to the general dexterous manipulation, we focus on a more complex definition of in-hand manipulation, where at the goal pose the hand has to reach a grasp suitable for using the object as a tool. The high level planner determines the object trajectory as well as the grasp changes, i.e. adding, removing, or sliding fingers, to be executed by the low-level controller. While the grasp sequence is planned online by a learning-based policy to adapt to variations, the trajectory planner and the low-level controller for object tracking and contact force control are exclusively model-based to robustly realize the plan. By infusing the knowledge about the physics of the problem and the low-level controller into the grasp planner, it learns to successfully generate grasps similar to those generated by model-based optimization approaches, obviating the high computation cost of online running of such methods to account for variations. By performing experiments in physics simulation for realistic tool use scenarios, we show the success of our method on different tool-use tasks and dexterous hand models. Additionally, we show that this hybrid method offers more robustness to trajectory and task variations compared to a model-based method."
10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10342308,Learning Whom to Trust in Navigation: Dynamically Switching Between Classical and Neural Planning,"Navigation of terrestrial robots is typically addressed either with localization and mapping (SLAM) followed by classical planning on the dynamically created maps, or by machine learning (ML), often through end-to-end training with reinforcement learning (RL) or imitation learning (IL). Recently, modular designs have achieved promising results, and hybrid algorithms that combine ML with classical planning have been proposed. Existing methods implement these combinations with handcrafted functions, which cannot fully exploit the complementary nature of the policies and the complex regularities between scene structure and planning performance. Our work builds on the hypothesis that the strengths and weaknesses of neural planners and classical planners follow some regularities, which can be learned from training data, in particular from interactions. This is grounded on the assumption that, both, trained planners and the mapping algorithms underlying classical planning are subject to failure cases depending on the semantics of the scene and that this dependence is learnable: for instance, certain areas, objects or scene structures can be reconstructed easier than others. We propose a hierarchical method composed of a high-level planner dynamically switching between a classical and a neural planner. We fully train all neural policies in simulation and evaluate the method in both simulation and real experiments with a LoCoBot robot, showing significant gains in performance, in particular in the real environment. We also qualitatively conjecture on the nature of data regularities exploited by the high-level planner. © 2023 IEEE."
10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10342341,Formal Composition of Robotic Systems as Contract Programs,"Robotic systems are often composed of modular algorithms that each perform a specific function within a larger architecture, ranging from state estimation and task planning to trajectory optimization and object recognition. Existing work for specifying these systems as a formal composition of contract algorithms has limited expressiveness compared to the variety of sophisticated architectures that are commonly used in practice. Therefore, in this paper, we (1) propose a novel metareasoning framework for formally composing robotic systems as a contract program with programming constructs for functional, conditional, and looping semantics and (2) introduce a recursive hill climbing algorithm that finds a locally optimal time allocation of a contract program. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline techniques in a simulated pick-and-place robot domain."

One of the main challenges in realizing such automation resides in efficiently finding solutions from a growing number of potential sequences for increasingly complex assemblies. Besides, costly feasibility checks are always required for the robotic system. To address this, we propose a holistic graphical approach including a graph representation called Assembly Graph for product assemblies and a policy architecture, Graph Assembly Processing Network, dubbed GRACE for assembly sequence generation. With GRACE, we are able to extract meaningful information from the graph input and predict assembly sequences in a step-by-step manner. In experiments, we show that our approach can predict feasible assembly sequences across product variants of aluminum profiles based on data collected in simulation of a dual-armed robotic system. We further demonstrate that our method is capable of detecting infeasible assemblies, substantially alleviating the undesirable impacts from false predictions, and hence facilitating real-world deployment soon.

We introduce a novel TAMP architecture that integrates symbolic planning with reinforcement learning to enable autonomous adaptation in such environments, operating without human guidance. Our approach employs symbolic goal representation within a goal-oriented learning framework, coupled with planner-guided goal identification, effectively managing abrupt changes where traditional reinforcement learning, re-planning, and hybrid methods fall short. Through sequential novelty injections in our experiments, we assess our method's adaptability to continual learning scenarios. Extensive simulations conducted in a robotics domain corroborate the superiority of our approach, demonstrating faster convergence to higher performance compared to traditional methods. The success of our framework in navigating diverse novelty scenarios within a continuous domain underscores its potential for critical real-world applications. © 2024 IEEE."
10.1109/IROS58592.2024.10801798,Real-Time Semantic Segmentation in Natural Environments with SAM-assisted Sim-to-Real Domain Transfer,"Semantic segmentation plays a pivotal role in many robotic applications requiring high-level scene understanding, such as smart farming, where the precise identification of trees or plants can aid navigation and crop monitoring tasks. While deep-learning-based semantic segmentation approaches have reached outstanding performance in recent years, they demand large amounts of labeled data for training. Inspired by modern Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) techniques, in this paper, we introduce a two-step training pipeline specifically tailored to challenging natural scenes, where the availability of annotated data is often quite limited. Our strategy involves the initial training of a powerful domain adaptive architecture, followed by a refinement stage, where segmentation masks predicted by the Segment Anything Model (SAM) are used to improve the accuracy of the predictions on the target dataset. These refined predictions serve as pseudo-labels to supervise the training of a final distilled architecture for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments conducted in two real-world scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, we show that our pipeline enables the training of a MobileNetV3 that achieves significant mIoU gains of 3.60% and 11.40% on our two datasets compared to the DAFormer while only demanding 1/15 of the latter’s inference time.

10.1109/IROS58592.2024.10801900,Behavior Tree Based Decentralized Multi-agent Coordination for Balanced Servicing of Time Varying Task Queues,"In this article, we present a reactive multi-agent coordination architecture for the management of material flows between production/pickup stages and delivery/drop-off stages, in scenarios such as underground mines and automated factory floors. The pickup and delivery stages are modelled as variable task queues, with no a priori information about the inflow into the production queues. The proposed solution coordinates the movement of a group of mobile agents operating between the two stages in a reactive and scalable manner, so that the material is transported from multiple production queues to multiple delivery queues in a balanced/equalized manner. In such a scenario, centralized planners suffer from low reactivity and poor scaling, as the number of agents and number of queues increases. To overcome this problem, we propose a decentralized approach comprising of two separate auction-based task distribution systems for the production and delivery stages, along with behavior-tree based management of agent autonomy and task bidding. Each auction system tracks the length of production/delivery queues and solves the optimal task assignment, based on the bids submitted by the agents. The agents participate in one of the two auction systems at any given time, based on the status of the behavior tree executing the two-stage tasks. We analytically show that the proposed decentralized auctioning approach along with agent autonomy and bidding managed by behavior trees, offers better scalability and reactiveness compared to the centralized approach. The proposed methodology is experimentally validated in a lab environment, in three illustrative material flow management scenarios, using TurtleBot3 robots as agents."
10.1109/IROS58592.2024.10802094,Environment Transformer and Policy Optimization for Model-Based Offline Reinforcement Learning,"Interacting with the actual environment to acquire data is often costly and time-consuming in robotic tasks. Model-based offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a feasible solution. On the one hand, it eliminates the requirements of interaction with the actual environment. On the other hand, it learns the transition dynamics and reward function from the offline datasets and generates simulated rollouts to accelerate training. Previous model-based offline RL methods adopt probabilistic ensemble neural networks (NN) to model aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. However, this results in a great increase in training time and computing resource requirements. Furthermore, these methods are easily disturbed by the accumulative errors of the environment dynamics models when simulating long-term rollouts. To solve the above problems, we propose an uncertainty-aware sequence modeling architecture called Environment Transformer. It models the probability distribution of the environment dynamics and reward function to capture aleatoric uncertainty and treats epistemic uncertainty as a learnable noise parameter. Benefiting from the accurate modeling of the transition dynamics and reward function, Environment Transformer can be combined with arbitrary planning, dynamics programming, or policy optimization algorithms for offline RL. In this case, we perform Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) to learn a conservative Q-function. Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves or exceeds state-of-the-art performance in widely studied offline RL benchmarks. Moreover, we show that Environment Transformer's simulated rollout quality, sample efficiency, and long-term rollout simulation capability are superior to those of previous model-based offline RL methods."

The current pre-programmed disassembly conducted by the Autonomous Mobile Manipulator Robot(AMMR) struggles to meet the disassembly requirements in dynamic environments, complex scenarios, and unstructured processes. In this paper, we propose a Battery Disassembly AMMR(BEAM-1) system based on NeuralSymbolic AI. It detects the environmental state by leveraging a combination of multi-sensors and neural predicates and then translates this information into a quasi-symbolic space. In real-time, it identifies the optimal sequence of action primitives through LLM-heuristic tree search, ensuring high-precision execution of these primitives. Additionally, it employs positional speculative sampling using intuitive networks and achieves the disassembly of various bolt types with a meticulously designed end-effector. Importantly, BEAM-1 is a continuously learning embodied intelligence system capable of subjective reasoning like a human, and possessing intuition. A large number of real scene experiments have proved that it can autonomously perceive, decide, and execute to complete the continuous disassembly of bolts in multiple, multi-category, and complex situations, with a success rate of 98.78%. This research attempts to use NeuroSymbolic AI to give robots real autonomous reasoning, planning, and learning capabilities. BEAM-1 realizes the revolution of battery disassembly. Its framework can be easily ported to any robotic system to realize different application scenarios, which provides a ground-breaking idea for the design and implementation of future embodied intelligent robotic systems."
10.1109/IROS58592.2024.10802347,Enhancing Surgical Precision in Autonomous Robotic Incisions via Physics-Based Tissue Cutting Simulation,"In soft tissue surgeries, such as tumor resections, achieving precision is of utmost importance. Surgeons conventionally achieve this precision through intraoperative adjustments to the cutting plan, responding to deformations from tool-tissue interactions. This study examines the integration of physics-based tissue cutting simulations into autonomous robotic surgery to preoperatively predict and compensate for such deformations, aiming to improve surgical precision and reduce the necessity for dynamic adjustments during autonomous surgeries. This study adapts a real-to-sim-to-real workflow. Initially, the Autonomous System for Tumor Resection (ASTR) was employed to evaluate its accuracy in performing preoperatively intended incisions along the irregular contours of porcine tongue pseudotumors. Following this, a finite element analysis-based simulation, utilizing the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA), was developed and tuned to accurately mimic these tissue and incision interactions. Insights gained from this simulation were applied to refine the robot’s path planning, ensuring a closer alignment of actual incisions with the initially intended surgical plan. The efficacy of this approach was validated by comparing surface incision precision on ex vivo porcine tongues, with the average absolute error reducing from 1.73mm to 1.46mm after applying simulation-driven path adjustments (p < 0.001). Additionally, our method not only demonstrated improvements in maintaining the intended cutting shapes and locations, with shape matching scores using Hu moments enhancing from 0.10 to 0.06 and centroid shifts decreasing from 2.09mm to 1.33mm, but it also potentially reduced the likelihood of adverse oncologic outcomes by preventing clinically suggested excessively close margins of 2.2mm. This feasibility study suggests that merging physics-based cutting simulations with autonomous robotic surgery could potentially lead to more accurate incisions."
10.1109/IROS58592.2024.10802379,A Neurosymbolic Approach to Adaptive Feature Extraction in SLAM,"Autonomous robots, autonomous vehicles, and humans wearing mixed-reality headsets require accurate and reliable tracking services for safety-critical applications in dynamically changing real-world environments. However, the existing tracking approaches, such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), do not adapt well to environmental changes and boundary conditions despite extensive manual tuning. On the other hand, while deep learning-based approaches can better adapt to environmental changes, they typically demand substantial data for training and often lack flexibility in adapting to new domains. To solve this problem, we propose leveraging the neurosymbolic program synthesis approach to construct adaptable SLAM pipelines that integrate the domain knowledge from traditional SLAM approaches while leveraging data to learn complex relationships. While the approach can synthesize end-to-end SLAM pipelines, we focus on synthesizing the feature extraction module. We first devise a domain-specific language (DSL) that can encapsulate domain knowledge on the essential attributes for feature extraction and the real-world performance of various feature extractors. Our neurosymbolic architecture then undertakes adaptive feature extraction, optimizing parameters via learning while employing symbolic reasoning to select the most suitable feature extractor. Our evaluations demonstrate that our approach, neurosymbolic Feature EXtraction (nFEX), yields higher-quality features. It also reduces the pose error observed for the state-of-the-art baseline feature extractors ORB and SIFT by up to 90% and up to 66%, respectively, thereby enhancing the system's efficiency and adaptability to novel environments. © 2024 IEEE."

To achieve human-like rationality in dealing with the grasping task, the agent requires hybrid intelligence from multilateral aspects. This paper introduces RelationGrasp, a unified framework employing a transformer encoder-decoder structure to simultaneously achieve open-vocabulary object detection, manipulation relationship inference, and grasp pose detection. A unique object-oriented prompt learning mechanism is designed to seamlessly bridge the grasp pose and manipulation relationship branches, delivering high fidelity of object-grasp affiliation for object-aware grasping and grasp sequence planning. By formulating the relationship detection as an adjacency matrix regression task under multi-task learning, our framework significantly increases the relationship accuracy with reduced computational overhead. Moreover, to facilitate the robust and adaptive deployment of the proposed RelationGrasp to novel environments, we propose a consistency-based self-supervised adaptation strategy to adapt the pre-trained network to new scenarios and improve grasp accuracy on unseen objects. Our proposed network achieved state-of-the-art performance on various public dataset such as VMRD, OCID, etc., in both grasp detection and manipulation relationship classification, and real-world robot experiments has also been conducted to show the practical usages."
10.1109/IROS58592.2024.10802589,SceneSense: Diffusion Models for 3D Occupancy Synthesis from Partial Observation,"When exploring new areas, robotic systems generally exclusively plan and execute controls over geometry that has been directly measured. This planning paradigm can lead to unintuitive exploration or replanning latency when entering areas that were previous obstructed from view. To address this we present SceneSense, a real-time 3D diffusion model for synthesizing 3D occupancy information from partial observations that effectively predicts these occluded or out of view geometries for use in future planning and control frameworks. SceneSense uses a running occupancy map and a single RGB-D camera to generate predicted geometry around the platform at runtime, even when the geometry is occluded or out of view. Our architecture ensures that SceneSense never overwrites observed free or occupied space. By preserving the integrity of the observed map, SceneSense mitigates the risk of corrupting the observed space with generative predictions. While SceneSense is shown to operate well using a single RGB-D camera, the framework is flexible enough to extend to additional modalities. Unlike existing models that necessitate multiple views and offline scene synthesis, or are focused on filling gaps in observed data, our findings demonstrate that SceneSense is an effective approach to estimating unobserved local occupancy information at runtime. Local occupancy predictions from SceneSense are shown to better represent the ground truth occupancy distribution during the test exploration trajectories than the running occupancy map.

This method implements a hybrid-object-based state-space Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm to manage needle regrasps. Previous methods have attempted to pick up a loose surgical needle in the environment and then use the same grasp to begin suturing; however, the initial needle grasp is not always ideal in terms of the needle pose with respect to the gripper or the workspace of the arm. Thus, it is advantageous to regrasp the needle in a more optimal manner before suturing proper begins. To solve the problem, a hybrid-object state space (HySS) planner is implemented under the RRT - Connect motion planning framework. This planner is able to find a collision-free handoff manipulation path connected by a series of intermediate hybrid states. We show that this algorithm produces trajectories which can be successfully executed by a simulated da Vinci® robot and result in grasps that are optimal as defined by [1]."

To address these challenges, this paper proposes an improved DDPG-guided RRT* algorithm (DDPG-RRT*) based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient. Firstly, we develop an end-node-based DDPG-guided sampling mechanism with a multi-objective reward function that integrates goal orientation and Gaussian obstacle constraints. This enhancement improves the goal-directed sampling distribution and strengthens exploration capability in narrow passages. Secondly, joint motion penalty and condition number penalty terms are incorporated into the reward function to ensure joint movement safety and singularity avoidance. Thirdly, a hybrid sampling strategy is implemented to probabilistically combine spatial random sampling with DDPG-guided sampling, achieving a balance between asymptotic optimality and enhanced planning efficiency and stability. Finally, simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed DDPG-RRT* algorithm outperforms the RRT*, PRRT*, and RRT-Connect methods in terms of path length, number of nodes in the generated paths, computational efficiency, and smoothness of joint motion trajectories."

But there are still limitations in sensing, reasoning, and manipulation that ask for future manned Mars missions, where human-level ingenuity can fill these gaps. By not using fully autonomous robots but keeping the human in the loop, semi-autonomous cooperation between astronauts and robots can assist astronauts in their daily work, to save valuable resources, increase safety by taking over risky tasks, and reduce their cognitive workload. While recent work has mainly focused on the specific capabilities of robots, we aim to develop and investigate a full exploration cascade utilizing this principle in the context of the AMADEE-24 Mars analog mission taking place in Armenia.In this paper, we present a mission architecture utilizing a semi-autonomous exploration robot to be operated by analog astronauts aiming at investigating and verifying geological hypotheses on Mars. We design an architecture that is intuitive to use by astronauts and researchers on the ground, fits well into exploration procedures, and provides semi-autonomous capabilities to reduce the astronauts’ task load.

Effective and efficient field systems and information flow with the support teams are paramount for mission success, particularly in crewed missions such as the upcoming Artemis (Moon) and planned Mars missions.

To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-level and multi-agent collaborative control platform for urban-scale virtual power plants based on a cloud-pipe-edge-end fusion architecture. By introducing technologies such as cloud computing, edge computing and the Internet of Things, the platform designs a multi-level control architecture that includes functional modules such as physical information modeling, resource aggregation optimization, automatic power control and instruction decomposition.

In such scenarios, smooth, unbiased control signals save energy and mitigate mechanical strain. We propose a decentralized control system architecture that produces a globally stable emergent structure from local observations only; there is no requirement for agents to share a global plan or follow prescribed trajectories. Central to our approach is the formulation of an injective virtual embedding induced by rotations from the actual agent positions. This embedding serves as a structure-preserving map around which all agent stabilize their relative positions and permits the use of well-established linear control techniques. We construct the embedding such that it is topologically equivalent to the desired trajectory (i.e., a homeomorphism), thereby preserving the stability characteristics. We demonstrate the versatility of this approach through implementation on a swarm of Quanser QDrone quadcopters. Results demonstrate the quadcopters self-organize into the desired trajectory while maintaining even separation."

This strategy refines the charging guidance task into a double-layer finite Markov decision process for the complex feature information in the coupled system of electric vehicles, charging stations, and transportation networks. In this architecture, the upper network adopts a centralized learning and decentralized execution strategy, and each electric vehicle is regarded as an independent agent. These agents cooperate in diverse incentives and competitive environments to jointly recommend the best charging station locations. At the same time, the action decision outputs of the upper network are integrated into the state considerations of the lower multi-agents. The lower network adopts the same solution method as the upper network, and the lower multi-agent plans the optimal driving paths based on the latest EV and traffic network states after receiving the upper decision. Further, a multi-agent hybrid Q learning algorithm is introduced to solve the problem, and constraints are imposed on the agent rewards to guide the multi-agent learning. Finally, simulation results validate that the proposed strategy enhances electric vehicle charging efficiency and promotes efficient road network operation."

So far, mostly non-learning algorithms like reservation or optimization-based ones were proposed to solve the underlying multi-agent planning problem. At the same time, automated driving functions for a single ego vehicle are increasingly implemented using machine learning methods. In this work, we build upon a previously presented graph-based scene representation and graph neural network to approach the problem using reinforcement learning. The scene representation is improved in key aspects by using edge features in addition to the existing node features for the vehicles. This leads to an increased representation quality that is leveraged by an updated network architecture. The paper provides an in-depth evaluation of the proposed method against baselines that are commonly used in automatic intersection management. Compared to a traditional signalized intersection and an enhanced first-in-first-out scheme, a significant reduction of traversal duration is observed at varying traffic densities. Finally, the generalization capability of the graph-based representation is evaluated by testing the policy on intersection layouts not seen during training. The model generalizes virtually without restrictions to smaller intersection layouts and within certain limits to larger ones."

The system is operated remotely with negligible risk to the operator. The integration of information collected by three robots has been achieved by software architecture. With this architecture, it is possible to plan the mission path, optimize the sensor settings and visualize the data from a remote terminal (e.g., a tablet or smartphone). The sensors used for the detection of plastic and metal landmines are installed in a configuration of three robots: microwave radar (Robot #1 with a UWB radar and Robot #3 with HSR radar), LiDAR (Robot #1 and Robot #3), high-resolution camera (Robot #1), and metal detector (Robot #2).

These are generally difficult to detect with metal detectors alone. In real scenarios like the ongoing war in Ukraine, surface landmines like the PFM-1 (“butterfly”), are often scattered on the surface, and we demonstrated how artificial intelligence can be applied to detect this type of threat. Finally, because of booby traps rigged to protect minefields, demining also requires the detection of tripwires.

Internet of Things (IoT) of networked robots and physiological intervention can be combined to identify and control the spread of the different variants of COVID-19 disease. With this approach, governments and healthcare institutions can plan for such diseases in the future. This article presents a compact computational model (CCM) to identify and control different COVID-19 variants using IoT-networked robots. The CCM comprises seven physiological variables (PVs) and robotic identification (RI) of infected individuals as alternative intervention strategies.

This capability allows a ship to autonomously survey and obtain situational awareness on a floating unresponsive target from a safe stand-off before inspecting it more closely or navigating around it. The target could be another ship, structure, or a navigational obstruction like an iceberg. The proposed solution is a collaborative system with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV), and an unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The UAV captures visual imagery to create a 3-D model of the target’s above-water geometry using photogrammetry. The UUV surveys the target’s submerged hull with integrated imaging and profiling bathymetric sonars. The USV hosts an intelligent mission-planning node which manages the robotic collaboration in a centralized architecture by autonomously planning and distributing the missions for the UUV and UAV. The intelligent node also adaptively plans the USV’s trajectory to support the other autonomous assets, specifically reducing and bounding the UUV’s state-estimate error through collaborative localization. The resulting above- and below-water sensor data is fused at the waterplane, using a sliding correlation algorithm, to yield a 3-D representation of the floating unresponsive target. The contributions from this article include the cross-domain robotic collaboration and autonomous mission-planning toward acquiring and fusing data from heterogeneous robots.

Challenges include the strong static magnetic field, rapidly switching magnetic field gradients, high-power radio frequency pulses, sensitivity to electrical noise, and constrained space to operate within the bore of the scanner. MRI has a number of advantages over other medical imaging modalities, including no ionizing radiation, excellent soft-tissue contrast that allows for visualization of tumors and other features that are not readily visible by other modalities, true 3-D imaging capabilities, including the ability to image arbitrary scan plane geometry or perform volumetric imaging, and capability for multimodality sensing, including diffusion, dynamic contrast, blood flow, blood oxygenation, temperature, and tracking of biomarkers.

10.1109/JSEN.2025.3598958,Robotic Respiratory Liver Motion Compensation for Stable Ultrasound Imaging of Small Lesions,"Real-time ultrasound-guided percutaneous liver biopsy plays a crucial role in diagnosing early liver cancer. However, patient respiration can cause liver drift, causing small target lesions to deviate from the ultrasound imaging plane and become invisible, complicating accurate punctures. To address this, we introduce an automatic robotic respiratory liver motion compensation method, which relies on real-time estimation of liver motion to maintain the stability between the ultrasound imaging plane and the lesion observation plane. We propose an end-to-end respiratory liver motion estimation network, termed ReME-Net. This network effectively utilizes the difference features between the current and target ultrasound frames, combined with the sequential channel-spatial attention mechanism, to accurately estimate the six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) respiratory liver motion in real time, without any tracking device. We employ a hybrid force–position control framework with an adaptive variable admittance controller to ensure stable probe-skin contact while compensating for liver motion, facilitating stable imaging of small lesions. On this basis, a robotic ultrasound imaging system is developed and experiments on a liver motion simulation platform demonstrate successful tracking with mean errors of 3.05 mm in translation, 2.52° in rotation, and 0.25 N in contact force, while periodic liver motion has a translation amplitude of 19.72 mm and a rotation amplitude of 17.32°.

10.1109/JSEN.2025.3610955,Improved DQN-Based Intelligent Trajectory Control for Coal Gangue Sorting Robotic Manipulators,"In the context of intelligent motion control for a coal gangue picking robot’s manipulator based on reinforcement learning, we develop an optimal neural network control model to govern the robot’s arm motion trajectory through interaction with the environment. However, this model exhibits significant randomness, which results in limited training effectiveness and low control efficiency. To address these issues, this article proposes an improved deep  $Q$ -network (IM-DQN) approach for intelligent control of the robot’s arm motion. A prioritized experience replay mechanism is employed in the construction of the motion control data experience pool. By using an optimal experience retention strategy and exploration suppression rate, the approach effectively prevents the rapid expansion of the experience pool and avoids network collapse. Furthermore, a dual neural network architecture is introduced, where motion control data and experience pool data are processed separately, aligning the learning process with the reward structure. A Markov decision process (MDP) is applied to establish the motion control model for the coal gangue picking robot’s manipulator, converting the robotic arm path planning problem into a Markov decision problem. Additionally, an intrinsic curiosity module (ICM) is incorporated into the model to enhance motion control, thereby improving convergence speed, control accuracy, and overall performance. Comparative experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms traditional reinforcement learning approaches by preventing network collapse, ensuring control stability, generating shorter and more accurate motion paths for the robotic arm, and improving trajectory accuracy by 17.6% and reducing average path length by 26.2% versus DQN baselines."

10.1109/LCSYS.2020.3045086,Closed-Loop Reference Model Based Distributed Model Reference Adaptive Control for Multi-Agent Systems,"This letter confluences ideas from distributed model reference adaptive control (MRAC) architecture for multi-agent systems and closed-loop reference model (CRM) based MRAC algorithm. The concept of CRM is recently proposed in literature for single-agent MRAC problems, where the reference model (leader) gets feedback from the plant (agent/follower) to facilitate improved transient performance. This letter coins the concept of CRM based distributed MRAC, where it is assumed that the leader/reference model is connected only to a subset of followers and incorporates feedback from them in a multi-agent setting. Distributed parameter estimator and controller are designed, which incorporate inter-agent cooperation via communication over a bi-directional graph. The leader state and the time-varying leader input (also known as reference input in MRAC literature) are only accessible to its neighbours. A novel distributed dynamic surface control (DSC)-like strategy is invoked for each follower to cooperatively estimate the unknown reference input required for control design. Simulation results dictate that the proposed closed-loop leader based formulation leads to better transient performance as compared to the status quo and also enables the use of high gain tuners for adaptive update law. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first work which introduces a distributed protocol of CRM-MRAC for multi-agent systems (CRM-DMRAC) with rigorous Lyapunov analysis."

The combination of legs and wheels might be a solution for any real-world application requiring rapid, and long-distance mobility skills on challenging terrain. In this letter, we present an online trajectory optimization framework for wheeled quadrupedal robots capable of executing hybrid walking-driving locomotion strategies. By breaking down the optimization problem into a wheel and base trajectory planning, locomotion planning for high dimensional wheeled-legged robots becomes more tractable, can be solved in real-time on-board in a model predictive control fashion, and becomes robust against unpredicted disturbances. The reference motions are tracked by a hierarchical whole-body controller that sends torque commands to the robot. Our approach is verified on a quadrupedal robot with non-steerable wheels attached to its legs. The robot performs hybrid locomotion with a great variety of gait sequences on rough terrain.

10.1109/LRA.2020.3009063,Manipulation Planning Using Object-Centered Predicates and Hierarchical Decomposition of Contextual Actions,"Current approaches combining task and motion planning require intensive geometric and symbolic reasoning to find feasible motions for task execution. The poor expressiveness of task planning domains for characterizing geometric changes with actions and the difficulties faced by current approaches to efficiently identify motion dependencies for plan execution produce expensive callings to motion planning on unfeasible actions and intensive reasoning to find realizable plans. In this work we combine two recent approaches to address these problems. Task planning is carried out using an object-centered description of geometric relations that consistently characterizes changes in the object configuration space. Plan execution is implemented using a symbol to motion hierarchical decomposition that depends on consecutive actions in the plan, rather than on single actions, which permits considering motion dependencies across plan actions for a successful execution. © 2016 IEEE."
10.1109/LRA.2020.3010495,RoVaLL: Design and Development of a Multi-Terrain Towed Robot With Variable Lug-Length Wheels,"Robotic systems play a very important role in exploration, allowing us to reach places that would otherwise be unsafe or unreachable to humans, such as volcanic areas, disaster sites or unknown areas in other planets. As the area to be explored increases, so does the time it takes for robots to explore it. One approach to reduce the required time is using multiple autonomous robots to perform distributed exploration. However, this significantly increases the associated cost and the complexity of the exploration process. To address these issues, in the past we proposed a leader-follower architecture where multiple two-wheeled passive robots capable of steering only using brakes are pulled by a leader robot. By controlling their relative angle with respect to the leader, the followers could move in arbitrary formations. The proposed follower robots used rubber tires, which allowed it to perform well in rigid ground, but poorly in soft soil. One alternative is to use lugged wheels, which increase the traction in soft soils. In this letter we propose a robot with shape-shifting wheels that allow it to steer in both rigid and soft soils. The wheels use a cam mechanism to push out and retract lugs stored on its inside. The shape of the wheel can be manipulated by controlling the driving torque exerted on the cam mechanism. Through experiments we verified that the developed mechanism allowed the follower robots to control their relative angle with respect to the leader in both rigid and soft soils."

Exploiting a low-cost pressure-based sensing technique, we propose here a Smith-predictor-based joint torque control of an RDHT-based actuation system. We also use a load-cell sensor for ground truth validation. The developed feedback controller is conveniently tuned based on an arbitrary pre-specified closed-loop natural frequency and damping ratio. This preserves the open-loop bandwidth while removing the intrinsic oscillations of the lightly damped highly transparent open-loop plant. Experimental tests validate the proposed control strategy, both in a stand-alone torque setpoint configuration and in a series of Human-Robot-Interaction tests confirming the significant advantages of the closed-loop control architecture."
10.1109/LRA.2021.3068910,Representation-Optimal Multi-Robot Motion Planning Using Conflict-Based Search,"Multi-Agent Motion Planning (MAMP) is the problem of computing feasible paths for a set of agents each with individual start and goal states within a continuous state space. Existing approaches can be split into coupled methods which provide optimal solutions but struggle with scalability or decoupled methods which provide scalable solutions but offer no optimality guarantees. Recent work has explored hybrid approaches that leverage the advantages of both coupled and decoupled approaches in an easier discrete subproblem, Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF). In this work, we adapt recent developments in hybrid MAPF to the continuous domain of MAMP. We demonstrate the scalability of our method to manage groups of up to 32 agents, demonstrate the ability to handle up to 8 high-DOF manipulators, and plan for heterogeneous teams. In all scenarios, our approach plans significantly faster while providing higher quality solutions."
10.1109/LRA.2021.3070308,Volumetric Occupancy Mapping With Probabilistic Depth Completion for Robotic Navigation,"In robotic applications, a key requirement for safe and efficient motion planning is the ability to map obstacle-free space in unknown, cluttered 3D environments. However, commodity-grade RGB-D cameras commonly used for sensing fail to register valid depth values on shiny, glossy, bright, or distant surfaces, leading to missing data in the map. To address this issue, we propose a framework leveraging probabilistic depth completion as an additional input for spatial mapping. We introduce a deep learning architecture providing uncertainty estimates for the depth completion of RGB-D images. Our pipeline exploits the inferred missing depth values and depth uncertainty to complement raw depth images and improve the speed and quality of free space mapping. Evaluations on synthetic data show that our approach maps significantly more correct free space with relatively low error when compared against using raw data alone in different indoor environments; thereby producing more complete maps that can be directly used for robotic navigation tasks. The performance of our framework is validated using real-world data."
10.1109/LRA.2021.3128935,Towards a Hybrid-ASP Planning Approach With Adjoint Observation for Incomplete Task-Relevant Information,"In the real world, robot task plans may easily become invalid due to unexpected state dynamics, preventing the robot from accessing the complete task-relevant information. The possible occurrence of information incompleteness during robot plan execution expects the robot to sense the environment and obtain the missing information actively. A set of planning and reasoning approaches has focused on robotic tasks in incomplete domains. However, the sensing action operators are generally abstracted as passively receiving sensory information and formulating a finite set of observations. The strict constraint of solely sensing without actively acting on the environment greatly reduces the chances of revealing more hidden information. This letter proposes a novel observation plan that couples an atomic sensing action with parallel actuating effects, and an adjoint observation scheme for actively run-time information gathering. To concretely realize the adjoint observation scheme, we present a Hybrid-ASP planning approach that integrates a deterministic task planner for generating an initially valid task plan for task achievement and a logic-based Answer Set Planner to make observation plans. Compared with the baseline planning approaches available, the experimental results have validated improved planning efficiency and plan effectiveness of information gathering from the Hybrid-ASP approach."
10.1109/LRA.2021.3135940,Learning an Explainable Trajectory Generator Using the Automaton Generative Network (AGN),"Symbolic reasoning is a key component for enabling practical use of data-driven planners in autonomous driving. In that context, deterministic finite state automata (DFA) are often used to formalize the underlying high-level decision-making process. Manual design of an effective DFA can be tedious. In combination with deep learning pipelines, DFA can serve as an effective representation to learn and process complex behavioral patterns. The goal of this work is to leverage that potential. We propose the automaton generative network (AGN), a differentiable representation of DFAs. The resulting neural network module can be used standalone or as an embedded component within a larger architecture. In evaluations on deep learning based autonomous vehicle planning tasks, we demonstrate that incorporating AGN improves the explainability, sample efficiency, and generalizability of the model. © 2016 IEEE."

10.1109/LRA.2022.3143890,Autonomous Source Term Estimation in Unknown Environments: From a Dual Control Concept to UAV Deployment,"In the gas source search and localisation problem, the use of autonomous robots is of increasing interest due to their deployment speed and lack of human interaction with hazardous materials. This letter presents an aerial robotic platform for performing source term estimation of an unknown chemical release in a challenging a-priori unknown and GPS-denied environment. The proposed system forms the search strategy using the state-of-the-art control concept, dual control for exploitation and exploration, and realises such a function in the aforementioned challenging scenario using an RRT* based path planner. A novel downsampling process on the RRT* is also proposed that addresses the computational infeasibility of calculating the utility of a large number of sample states, whilst still maintaining sample state diversity. The proposed algorithm is tested in a high fidelity simulation environment under a number of configurations, and compared against competing algorithms. The system architecture is also brought forward into a bespoke UAV platform and experimentally tested in real-world conditions. The proposed system is shown to be capable of performing source term estimation robustly and efficiently, which provides a step forward in showing the real world application of previously academic functions."
10.1109/LRA.2022.3146515,Kineverse: A Symbolic Articulation Model Framework for Model-Agnostic Mobile Manipulation,"Service robots in the future need to execute abstract instructions such as “fetch the milk from the fridge”. To translate such instructions into actionable plans, robots require in-depth background knowledge. With regards to interactions with doors and drawers, robots require articulation models that they can use for state estimation and motion planning. Existing frameworks model articulated connections as abstract concepts such as prismatic, or revolute, but do not provide a parameterized model of these connections for computation. In this letter, we introduce a novel framework that uses symbolic mathematical expressions to model articulated structures – robots and objects alike – in a unified and extensible manner. We provide a theoretical description of this framework, and the operations that are supported by its models, and introduce an architecture to exchange our models in robotic applications, making them as flexible as any other environmental observation. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we employ our practical implementation Kineverse for solving common robotics tasks from state estimation and mobile manipulation, and use it further in real-world mobile robot manipulation."
10.1109/LRA.2022.3149031,"Design, Modeling and Validation of a Tendon-Driven Soft Continuum Robot for Planar Motion Based on Variable Stiffness Structures","Robotic structures based on variable stiffness enable high-performance and flexible motion systems that are inherently safe and thus allow safe Human-Robot Collaboration. This letter presents the design of a robotic structure based on variable stiffness. A robotic manipulator is developed using three variable stiff segments based on particle jamming with a backbone architecture and two tendons for an underactuated motion control of the whole structure. By switching the structural stiffness, the manipulator is able to perform complex planar motion with only one pair of tendons, reducing the number of actuators required. A kinematic modeling approach for the calculation of the forward kinematics of this soft continuum structure is presented, and the validation on the real system is explained. The kinematic simulation is performed with a multibody simulation model (MBS) using rigid body elements in combination with rotational springs. The validation of the model is carried out with visual measurements of the real system using defined target shapes. Simulation and experimental results are discussed and compared also with a common constant curvature model. The developed MBS-model demonstrates a promising modeling approach with a position error lower 3% for the calculation of the presented manipulator under gravity."

Modern connectionist methods employ deep neural networks that learn visual and linguistic features for mapping inputs to a sequence of low-level actions, in an end-to-end fashion.

10.1109/LRA.2022.3191170,Collaborative Navigation and Manipulation of a Cable-Towed Load by Multiple Quadrupedal Robots,"This letter tackles the problem of robots collaboratively towing a load with cables to a specified goal location while avoiding collisions in real time. The introduction of cables (as opposed to rigid links) enables the robotic team to travel through narrow spaces by changing its intrinsic dimensions through slack/taut switches of the cable. However, this is a challenging problem because of the hybrid mode switches and the dynamical coupling among multiple robots and the load. Previous attempts at addressing such a problem were performed offline and do not consider avoiding obstacles online. In this letter, we introduce a cascaded planning scheme with a parallelized centralized trajectory optimization that deals with hybrid mode switches. We additionally develop a set of decentralized planners per robot, which enables our approach to solve the problem of collaborative load manipulation online. We develop and demonstrate one of the first collaborative autonomy framework that is able to move a cable-towed load, which is too heavy to move by a single robot, through narrow spaces with real-time feedback and reactive planning in experiments."
10.1109/LRA.2022.3199676,Task and Motion Informed Trees (TMIT*): Almost-Surely Asymptotically Optimal Integrated Task and Motion Planning,"High-level autonomy requires discrete and continuous reasoning to decide both what actions to take and how to execute them. Integrated Task and Motion Planning (TMP) algorithms solve these hybrid problems jointly to consider constraints between the discrete symbolic actions (i.e., the task plan) and their continuous geometric realization (i.e., motion plans). This joint approach solves more difficult problems than approaches that address the task and motion subproblems independently. TMP algorithms combine and extend results from both task and motion planning. TMP has mainly focused on computational performance and completeness and less on solution optimality. Optimal TMP is difficult because the independent optima of the subproblems may not be the optimal integrated solution, which can only be found by jointly optimizing both plans. This letter presents Task and Motion Informed Trees (TMIT*), an optimal TMP algorithm that combines results from makespan-optimal task planning and almost-surely asymptotically optimal motion planning. TMIT* interleaves asymmetric forward and reverse searches to delay computationally expensive operations until necessary and perform an efficient informed search directly in the problem's hybrid state space. This allows it to solve problems quickly and then converge towards the optimal solution with additional computational time, as demonstrated on the evaluated robotic-manipulation benchmark problems."
10.1109/LRA.2023.3247221,Multimodal Grasp Planner for Hybrid Grippers in Cluttered Scenes,"Grasping a variety of objects is still an open problem in robotics, especially for cluttered scenarios. Multimodal grasping has been recognized as a promising strategy to improve the manipulation capabilities of a robotic system. This work presents a novel grasp planning algorithm for hybrid grippers that allows for multiple grasping modalities. In particular, the planner manages two-finger grasps, single or double suction grasps, and magnetic grasps. Grasps for different modalities are geometrically computed based on the cuboid and the material properties of the objects in the clutter. The presented framework is modular and can leverage any 6D pose estimation or material segmentation network as far as they satisfy the required interface. Furthermore, the planner can be applied to any (hybrid) gripper, provided the gripper clearance, finger width, and suction diameter. The approach is fast and has a low computational burden, as it uses geometric computations for grasp synthesis and selection. The performance of the system has been assessed with an experimental campaign in three manipulation scenarios of increasing difficulty using the objects of the YCB dataset and the DLR hybrid-compliant gripper."
10.1109/LRA.2023.3261708,Synergistic Task and Motion Planning With Reinforcement Learning-Based Non-Prehensile Actions,"Robotic manipulation in cluttered environments requires synergistic planning among prehensile and non-prehensile actions. Previous works on sampling-based Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) algorithms, e.g. PDDLStream, provide a fast and generalizable solution for multi-modal manipulation. However, they are likely to fail in cluttered scenarios where no collision-free grasping approaches can be sampled without preliminary manipulations. To extend the ability of sampling-based algorithms, we integrate a vision-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) non-prehensile procedure, pusher. The pushing actions generated by pusher can eliminate interlocked situations and make the grasping problem solvable. Also, the sampling-based algorithm evaluates the pushing actions by providing rewards in the training process, thus the pusher can learn to avoid situations leading to irreversible failures. The proposed hybrid planning method is validated on a cluttered bin-picking problem and implemented in both simulation and real world. Results show that the pusher can effectively improve the success ratio of the previous sampling-based algorithm, while the sampling-based algorithm can help the pusher learn pushing skills."
10.1109/LRA.2023.3315228,Approximate Optimal Controller Synthesis for Cart-Poles and Quadrotors via Sums-of-Squares,"Sums-of-squares (SOS) optimization is a promising tool to synthesize certifiable controllers for nonlinear dynamical systems. Building upon prior works (Lasserre et al., 2008), (Jiang and Jiang, 2015), we demonstrate that SOS can synthesize dynamic controllers with bounded suboptimal performance for various underactuated robotic systems by finding good approximations of the value function. We summarize a unified SOS framework to synthesize both under- and over- approximations of the value function for continuous-time, control-affine systems, use these approximations to generate approximate optimal controllers, and perform regional analysis on the closed-loop system driven by these controllers. We then extend the formulation to handle hybrid systems with contacts. We demonstrate that our method can generate tight under- and over- approximations of the value function with low-degree polynomials, which are used to provide stabilizing controllers for continuous-time systems including the inverted pendulum, the cart-pole, and the quadrotor as well as a hybrid system, the planar pusher. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a SOS-based time-invariant controller can swing up and stabilize a cart-pole, and push the planar slider to the desired pose."
10.1109/LRA.2023.3318118,A Modeling and Data-Driven Control Framework for Rigid-Soft Hybrid Robot With Visual Servoing,"In this letter, a rigid-soft hybrid robot with visual servoing is designed to improve robotic properties of accuracy and safe interaction, where the hybrid robot is connected by a soft robot and six degrees of freedom rigid robot in series. The series structure of rigid and soft parts brings the coupling and complexity to modeling. For synthesis modeling, we develop a state-space equation of the hybrid robot by the combination of the rigid and soft parts, where the rigid model is built by differential kinematics, and Piecewise Constant-Curvature and Lagrange equations are used to model the soft part with consideration of the elastic deformation caused by gravity loading. Based on the synthesis model, a model predictive controller is designed to eliminate the error between the hybrid robot terminal and the target position. Considering the imprecise modeling process disturbs the control performance, a data-driven strategy named input mapping is incorporated into the predictive controller to reduce the inaccuracy model effect and improve the control performance. In addition, the feedback error of the hybrid robot is transferred in the robot terminal coordinate system to avoid hand-eye calibration work. Finally, the experiments on a rigid-soft hybrid robot show the proposed method converges nearly twice as fast as the model predictive control method and two state-of-the-art motion planning methods for the visual servoing of the soft-rigid hybrid robot system."
10.1109/LRA.2023.3325759,Grasping Lightweight Objects With Chat-PM: A Rotorwash-Aware Motion Planning Method,"Grasping lightweight objects with aerial manipulators remains challenging due to the rotorwash interference caused by spinning rotor blades. This letter details a rotorwash-aware motion planning method for Chat-PM, a hybrid aerial-terrestrial vehicle equipped with a robotic arm. With proposed method's adjusting the vehicle's thrust and pose on flat surfaces timely, the rotorwash can be reduced and directed away from targets. To achieve this, we first model the rotorwash velocity distribution of Chat-PM in aerial and surface modes with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The model further functions as an optimization objective of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) method, alongside other objectives including aerial-surface reference tracking and target grasping. An aerial-surface path searching method for the vehicle is then introduced, which takes into consideration both rotorwash velocity and kinodynamic feasibility to generate a high-quality reference for NMPC to track. Experimental results showcase the effectiveness of our proposed planning approach for aerial-surface grasping with rotorwash optimization."
10.1109/LRA.2023.3337593,Hybrid Trajectory Optimization for Autonomous Terrain Traversal of Articulated Tracked Robots,"Autonomous terrain traversal of articulated tracked robots can reduce operator cognitive load to enhance task efficiency and facilitate extensive deployment. We present a novel hybrid trajectory optimization method aimed at generating efficient, stable, and smooth traversal motions. To achieve this, we develop a planar robot-terrain contact model and divide the robot's motion into hybrid modes of driving and traversing. By using a generalized coordinate description, the configuration space dimension is reduced, which facilitates real-time planning. The hybrid trajectory optimization is transcribed into a nonlinear programming problem and divided into subproblems to be solved in a receding-horizon planning fashion. Mode switching is facilitated by associating optimized motion durations with a predefined traversal sequence. A multi-objective cost function is formulated to further improve the traversal performance. Additionally, map sampling, terrain simplification, and tracking controller modules are integrated into the autonomous terrain traversal system. Our approach is validated in simulation and real-world scenarios with the Searcher robotic platform. Comparative experiments with expert operator control and state-of-the-art methods show advantages in terms of time and energy efficiency, stability, and smoothness of motion."

In this letter, a robotic puncture system with respiratory movement is firstly developed, which can simulate the different motions of body surface and internal organ during respiratory cycle. Then a force-position hybrid control framework is proposed, which includes needle insertion along the planned path at the end of inspiration and respiratory motion following according to interaction force sensing at the other phases. Since it requires only one CT scan at the end of inspiration, which complies with clinical routine procedures. Furthurmore, to avoid tearing damage of tissue, the robotic needle takes a virtual RCM constraint at the needle insertion point when following the respiratory motion. And for better respiratory motion compensation, an admittance control optimization method is proposed based on the maximal needle-tissue interaction force, the respiratory following displacement percentage and the overshoot dis-placement/force. Experiments have been conducted, and results show that compared with position control only, our proposed force-position control can reduce the needle-tissue interaction force by 74% and the target puncure error by 56%, indicating better safety and accuracy of robotic puncture with respiratory movement."
10.1109/LRA.2024.3396023,Actor-Hybrid-Attention-Critic for Multi-Logistic Robots Path Planning,"With the proliferation of express delivery services, the demand for intelligent logistic services is increasing. More and more robots are operating simultaneously, which poses a great challenge to their extraction of key information from a large number of static and dynamic environments. To address this, a Multi Actor Hybrid Attention Critic (MAHAC) algorithm for path planning of multi-logistic robots is proposed. The reward function is improved, based on collision avoidance and accurate arrival at the target location, a power shortage and sparse penalty are added to improve the efficiency of path planning. A hybrid attention mechanism module is designed, with an imbedded Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), to calculate the similarity between key and query. Combining the hybrid attention mechanism with the Multi Actor Attention Critic (MAAC) algorithm improves the ability of multi-logistic robots to extract critical states and action information in a variety of environments. In a simulated warehouse layout based on Amazon's Kiva system, the MAHAC algorithm is compared with MAAC, Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG), and Multi-Actor Soft Actor-Critic (MASAC) algorithms. The MAHAC has a higher reward value, so as to select the better path in the least time, with the highest accuracy and no collisions, and hence is suitable for the path planning scenario of multi-logistic robots."
10.1109/LRA.2024.3502067,A Hierarchical Multi Robot Coverage Strategy for Large Maps With Reinforcement Learning and Dense Segmented Siamese Network,"Complete coverage of multiple robots for a large map is an important collaborative planning task, which is widely used in disaster search and rescue, forest fire prevention, resource exploration, and other fields. It generally focuses on coverage completion with less robot (mostly drone) occupation and higher time efficiency. However, as the map becomes larger, most existing works will fail to remain near-optimal due to escalating complexity. In this letter, we formulate the problem as two levels of traveling salesman problem (TSP) to reduce the complexity, where the lower level is single-robot local coverage planning with preset TSP solutions, and the higher level is multiple TSP (mTSP) global planning executed by multiple robots. To better adapt to dynamic scenarios, we apply a distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that allows efficient online computation, and a dense segmented Siamese network (DSSN) to achieve efficient and effective solutions. We show that compared to existing advanced methods, our strategy can effectively solve the problem with coverage costs decreased by over 30$\%$ average and the execution time reduced to seconds in large maps. Furthermore, our network DSSN achieves an additional improvement with random settings to the previous mTSP architecture. We also discuss the influence of different robot densities and separated block sizes on the results, and demonstrate the adaptability to irregular and large-scale obstacles."
10.1109/LRA.2024.3511435,Multi-Agent Path Finding With Heterogeneous Geometric and Kinematic Constraints in Continuous Space,"Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) represents a pivotal area of research within multi-agent systems. Existing algorithms typically discretize the movement space of agents into grid or topology, neglecting agents' geometric characteristics and kinematic constraints. This limitation hampers their applicability and efficiency in practical industrial scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Priority-Based Search algorithm for heterogeneous mobile robots working in continuous space, addressing both geometric and kinematic constraints. This algorithm, named Continuous-space Heterogeneous Priority-Based Search (CHPBS), employs a two-level search structure and a priority tree for collision detection. To expedite single-agent path finding in continuous space, we introduce a Weighted Hybrid Safe Interval Path Planning algorithm (WHSIPP$_{d}$). Furthermore, we present three strategies to enhance our algorithm, collectively termed Enhanced-CHPBS (ECHPBS): Partial Expansion, Target Reasoning, and Adaptive Induced Priority. Comparative analysis against two baseline algorithms on a specialized benchmark demonstrates that ECHPBS achieves a success rate of 100% on a 100 m × 100 m map featuring 50 agents, with an average runtime of under 1 s, and maintains the same 100% success rate on a 300 m × 300 m map with 100 agents."
10.1109/LRA.2025.3539092,Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Robotic Pushing of Planar Objects With Generic Shape,"Robotic manipulation of objects in cluttered dynamic scenes is challenging for a twofold reason. Object detection and localization are complex due to partial occlusions and high variability in the object classes and manipulation in tight spaces is difficult due to potential collisions. The present letter focuses on the low-level control of the non-prehensile pushing action aimed at moving planar objects of generic shape along a given path with an assigned time law. Based on the continuous and nonlinear dynamics of the system, we propose a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC), which avoids the need for linearization and, thus, the hybrid dynamics arising from it. An extensive comparison with a state-of-the-art linear MPC demonstrates that the NMPC can successfully react to more general disturbances, outperforming the linear one. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the method in a task where a robot is required to grasp fruits in a container with other obstructing objects (shown in the attached video)."
10.1109/LRA.2025.3559836,Topo-Field: Topometric Mapping With Brain-Inspired Hierarchical Layout-Object-Position Fields,"Mobile robots require comprehensive scene understanding to operate effectively in diverse environments, enriched with contextual information such as layouts, objects, and their relationships. Although advances like neural radiance fields (NeRFs) offer high-fidelity 3D reconstructions, they are computationally intensive and often lack efficient representations of traversable spaces essential for planning and navigation. In contrast, topological maps are computationally efficient but lack the semantic richness necessary for a more complete understanding of the environment. Inspired by a population code in the postrhinal cortex (POR) strongly tuned to spatial layouts over scene content rapidly forming a high-level cognitive map, this work introduces Topo-Field, a framework that integrates Layout-Object-Position (LOP) associations into a neural field and constructs a topometric map from this learned representation. LOP associations are modeled by explicitly encoding object and layout information, while a Large Foundation Model (LFM) technique allows for efficient training without extensive annotations. The topometric map is then constructed by querying the learned neural representation, offering both semantic richness and computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations in multi-room environments demonstrate the effectiveness of Topo-Field in tasks such as position attribute inference, query localization, and topometric planning, successfully bridging the gap between high-fidelity scene understanding and efficient robotic navigation."
10.1109/LRA.2025.3577462,Collaborative Motion Planning for Multiple Tractor-Trailer Vehicles Based on Local Conflict Search and Priority Game Inheritance,"This paper introduces a novel approach for efficiently planning collision-free optimal trajectories for multiple tractor-trailer vehicles (TTVs) in environments with dense obstacles. The approach employs a hierarchical planning strategy to generate the initial homotopy path: at the higher level, it integrates body collision model and enhances conflict resolution through local priority strategy. At the lower level, the Tractor-Trailer Spatiotemporal Hybrid State A* (TT-SHA*) is employed, combining joint expansion with heuristic methods to efficiently generate paths for individual agents, while accounting for underactuated and nonholonomic constraints. To resolve priority deadlock issues, the concept of priority inheritance and backtracking is integrated into conflict search, which significantly improves the success rate and solving speed. Finally, it refines the path solution into smooth trajectories using nonlinear optimization based on corridor and relative safety distance constraints. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing TTV-improved Multi-Agent Motion Planning algorithms in scalability when handling large-scale TTV scenarios, providing a solution that is applicable for practical implementation."

The framework leverages model predictive interaction control (MPIC) as a path-following controller to enable dynamic replanning of motion and wrench references. A three-layered architecture divides the control task into decision-making, trajectory planning, and low-level robot control. The Fault Event Pipeline (FEP) is introduced to provide a structured approach for fault detection of pose and wrench errors, diagnosis, and recovery, supporting both forward and backward strategies. The framework integrates fault handling into task planning and execution, offering a unified solution for reliable robotic operations. Experimental validation with a 7-degree-of-freedom Franka-Emika robot demonstrates the framework's ability to handle diverse faults."
10.1109/LRA.2025.3627381,VLM-SFD: VLM-Assisted Siamese Flow Diffusion Framework for Dual-Arm Cooperative Manipulation,"Dual-arm cooperative manipulation holds great promise for tackling complex real-world tasks that demand seamless coordination and adaptive dynamics. Despite substantial progress in learning-based motion planning, most approaches struggle to generalize across diverse manipulation tasks and adapt to dynamic, unstructured environments, particularly in scenarios involving interactions between two objects such as assembly, tool use, and bimanual grasping. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel VLM-Assisted Siamese Flow Diffusion (VLM-SFD) framework for efficient imitation learning in dual-arm cooperative manipulation. The proposed VLM-SFD framework exhibits outstanding adaptability, significantly enhancing the ability to rapidly adapt and generalize to diverse real-world tasks from only a minimal number of human demonstrations. Specifically, we propose a Siamese Flow Diffusion Network (SFDNet) employs a dual-encoder-decoder Siamese architecture to embed two target objects into a shared latent space, while a diffusion-based conditioning process—conditioned by task instructions—generates two-stream object-centric motion flows that guide dual-arm coordination. We further design a dynamic task assignment strategy that seamlessly maps the predicted 2D motion flows into 3D space and incorporates a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to adaptively assign the optimal motion to each robotic arm over time. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its ability to generalize to diverse manipulation tasks while maintaining high efficiency and adaptability."

The simulator contains seven ring-shaped chambers along the J-shape stomach to perform contractions by applying pneumatic actuation. Experiments conducted previously for gastric emptying focused on liquid meals instead of solid meals, which have higher stiffness and require higher break-down forces. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a simulation model of SoGut when it grinds solid food contents that are beads (diameter 1.27 cm) containing agar gel and water at various mixing ratios. The simulation model is based on Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA), with the advantages of finite element method modelling and real-time simulation. First, the relationships between pressure inputs and contraction ratios of the modelling stomach are identified. Next, a series of peristaltic contractions is successfully simulated. An average error at 0.03 of contraction ratio is found, except chamber #5 that has an error at 0.12. Later, beads with different stiffness are placed in the center of chambers and tested to investigate the amount of forces applied to these contents. The stiffness of beads depends on the mixing ratio of agar gel and water, and the motions of beads are constrained on the cross-section plane of the chambers in order to avoid food contents escaping from the contracting regions. The average forces from different chambers applied on the contents in the antrum part of the simulated stomach are less than 0.9 N, which corresponds to the findings in the human stomach reported by literature. Meanwhile, it is also found that the strength of forces generated from the chambers of SoGut depends on the stiffness of the food contents. Additionally, the results of the simulation indicate that when the initial diameters of chambers increase, the provided average forces reduce."

In this work, we introduce a hybrid spiking and deep neural network architecture for actor-critic control of a 6-DOF robot arm. Our method firstly involves autonomous object detection via active vision exploration and thereafter, the entire hybrid architecture is described. In specific, the actor utilises an integrated-and-fire model for action generation, while the critic a deep neural one for action evaluation. Lastly, the benefits of this approach in terms of energy efficiency are extensively discussed."
10.1109/MED61351.2024.10566142,Local Bidding Strategies for Reactive and Scalable Auction-Based Multi-Agent Coordination,"This article proposes local bidding strategies for autonomous agents participating in an auction-based multi-agent coordination system, in order to improve the scalability and reactivity of the architecture in large-scale coordination scenarios. Based on a careful analysis of the reactivity requirements and the computational costs of the central auctioneer (costs for solving Linear Integer Programs) and the local agents (costs for path-planning and task execution), this article explores the idea of each agent bidding for a subset of available tasks that are locally relevant to the agent. Each agent first employs a computationally light euclidean distance-based and percentile-based screening method to choose a subset of available tasks, followed by a more computationally complex, but realistic path-planning based cost-estimation and bidding for the chosen subset. The proposed strategy not only reduces the overall computational cost at the agents, but also at the central auctioneer, by reducing the size of the combinatorial optimization problems and the overall communication requirements of the architecture, thereby improving the scalability and reactivity of the overall system. It is shown that, through a one-time simulation-guided design of the bidding parameters, the improved reactivity and scaling is achieved while retaining the optimality or near-optimality of the resulting task-allocation. The performance of the proposed bidding strategies is evaluated in two large-scale simulation scenarios and the reduction in computational costs and the near-optimality of the task allocation is demonstrated."

The platform, based on a multi agent blackboard architecture, is classified as a medical device according to the current EU regulation. Thus it needs extensive tests before being put into service for the planned clinical trials, which calls for a dedicated simulating and testing environment. Materials and Methods: Coordination in CAPABLE is achieved through the Case Manager, a component able to generate and notify events to other interested agent components. For representing and exchanging health care information we have adopted HL7 FHIR as a semantic interoperability standard. Results: FHIR has been exploited to design a structured history of a real patient affected by renal cell carcinoma. A simulator has been developed for automating the whole testing process represented by specific scenarios of the patient’s history. Conclusions: The simulator relies on the events produced by the Case Manager for coordinating the agents. This proved to be effective in checking that the agents reactions to new data showing up on the blackboard comply with the expected behavior."

Research aims to develop ecological protocols that allow personalized interventions based on impairment, functional abilities, and individual needs. This paper presents a preliminary study on the motor assessment component of a robotic rehabilitation protocol that will integrate motor and cognitive evaluation through eye tracking and kinematic analysis. The approach utilizes a bimanual robotic platform with a front-facing camera to guide subjects through gestures like reaching and bringing the hand to the mouth, adjusting movements based on motor and cognitive responses. Real-time vocal feedback enhances interaction, while movement parameters dynamically adapt to response time, motor performance, and task comprehension. Motor assessment combines data from the robot camera and two additional depth sensors, enabling near real-time kinematic and dynamic analysis, as well as an indirect evaluation of motor control. The cognitive assessment is planned to leverage eye-tracking technology for measuring ocular parameters related to attention and cognitive function. The paper focuses on the motor assessment component, presenting preliminary tests using a fixed-camera setup to refine the protocol for future integration with a mobile robotic platform."

Cooperative interaction is ensured by governing decision policies, and by considering the farmers expertise in strategical and tactical decisions.The adoption of farMAS is expected to make farming operations more sustainable by helping to use resources efficiently even in particular challenging situations like extreme weather phenomena, the introduction of new, stress-tolerant crop varieties, more controlled use of pesticides, employment of advanced sensing technologies, sharing of farming equipment, the processing of the data obtained with the latter, and the near real-time reaction to it."
10.1109/MetroAgriFor63043.2024.10948795,Trunk Based Monitoring and Data Collection System on Real-World Orchards: A Case Study,"In the context of Precision Agriculture, the importance of an effective information management system is crucial to enable the required accuracy and efficiency of tasks. Increasing the resolution of maps can improve this, up to reach the plant-based level, or even distinguish different parts or zones of the single tree. Therefore, plant/tree recognition became of paramount importance when adjusting inputs or estimating physiological properties. The research activities at the Cadriano experimental station of the University of Bologna are going towards this direction.

The cerebellum is known to be involved in control and learning of smooth coordinated movements. Furthermore, an accurate understanding of how this advance control engine works should have a strong impact in controlling biomorphic robots.

10.1109/MICRO56248.2022.00065,AgilePkgC: An Agile System Idle State Architecture for Energy Proportional Datacenter Servers,"Modern user-facing applications deployed in data-centers use a distributed system architecture that exacerbates the latency requirements of their constituent microservices (30--250μs). Existing CPU power-saving techniques degrade the performance of these applications due to the long transition latency (order of 100μs) to wake up from a deep CPU idle state (C-state). For this reason, server vendors recommend only enabling shallow core C-states (e.g., CC1) for idle CPU cores, thus preventing the system from entering deep package C-states (e.g., PC6) when all CPU cores are idle. This choice, however, impairs server energy proportionality since power-hungry resources (e.g., IOs, uncore, DRAM) remain active even when there is no active core to use them. As we show, it is common for all cores to be idle due to the low average utilization (e.g., 5 -- 20\%) of datacenter servers running user-facing applications.We propose to reap this opportunity with AgilePkgC (APC), a new package C-state architecture that improves the energy proportionality of server processors running latency-critical applications. APC implements PC1A (package C1 agile), a new deep package C-state that a system can enter once all cores are in a shallow C-state (i.e., CC1) and has a nanosecond-scale transition latency. PC1A is based on four key techniques. First, a hardware-based agile power management unit (APMU) rapidly detects when all cores enter a shallow core C-state (CC1) and triggers the system-level power savings control flow. Second, an IO Standby Mode (IOSM) places IO interfaces (e.g., PCIe, DMI, UPI, DRAM) in shallow (nanosecond-scale transition latency) low-power modes. Third, a CLM Retention (CLMR) mode rapidly reduces the CLM (Cache-and-home-agent, Last-level-cache, and Mesh network-on-chip) domain's voltage to its retention level, drastically reducing its power consumption. Fourth, APC keeps all system PLLs active in PC1A to allow nanosecond-scale exit latency by avoiding PLL re-locking overhead.Combining these techniques enables significant power savings while requiring less than 200ns transition latency, &gt;250\texttimes{} faster than existing deep package C-states (e.g., PC6), making PC1A practical for datacenter servers. Our evaluation based on an Intel Skylake-based server shows that APC reduces the energy consumption of Memcached by up to 41\% (25\% on average) with &lt;0.1\% performance degradation. APC provides similar benefits for other representative workloads."

This review paper focuses on two key agents in SQL QO: the Join Order Agent (JOA) and the Index Selection Agent (ISA). The JOA seeks to determine the optimal sequence for joining multiple tables, minimizing intermediate results and improving query execution time. The ISA identifies the most effective indexes to speed up data retrieval, considering various database schema configurations and query patterns. We review existing approaches for both agents, including heuristic-based methods, cost-based models, and machine learning (ML) techniques. The paper also highlights the challenges faced in these areas, such as the scalability of existing methods, the need for dynamic adaptation to changing workloads, and the integration of multiple optimization strategies. Finally, the paper discusses how multi-agent systems (MAS), and hybrid optimization techniques can address these challenges, offering significant improvements in QO for modern relational DBMS."
10.1109/MMAR49549.2021.9528474,A Novel Software Architecture of Anticipatory Harvesting Robot Teams,"This paper presents a novel application of anticipatory coordination and optimization principles, previously developed for autonomous inspection robot teams. The core tenet behind our research is to build a team of agile and relatively small robots, each equipped with two synergistically operating robotic arms, one arm with a soft gripper, the other arm with a set of cameras and a fruit cutting mechanism, all controlled by innovative anticipatory network (AN) algorithms. This allows the plantation management to efficiently supervise the team, coordinated and optimized by an adaptive anticipatory decision engine. Another key component of the robotic software architecture that allows the team of robots to efficiently harvest soft fruits such as strawberries or raspberries is a package of information fusion algorithms in the world model, associated with a knowledge base and a digital twin of the cover crops. We will show that AN coordination principles ensure the reliable operation of robots in case of communication disturbances or when uncertain or incomplete instructions are entered by the operator in the management and supervision system. The flexible design of the overall robotic architecture will make it possible to further develop the robot teams to respond to additional needs such as harvesting other fruits and working in various horticultural environments."

Moreover, external disturbances can also interfere with reference tracking performance. The paper presents a robust controller synthesis method for a class of nonlinear systems. It merges two state-of-the-art approaches, namely exact linearization by state feedback, and mu-synthesis which is known from linear robust control theory. The resulting architecture is cascaded, where the outer loop contains the robust, linear two-degrees-of-freedom (2DoF) controller, which has better disturbance rejection properties compared to its serial compensator counterpart. Two examples (the second being a 2DoF robotic arm) are used to illustrate the control design procedure, which is then validated by simulations."

Owing to the massive amounts of data, the need for extensive computing power, and the necessity to find and mitigate threats in real-time, traditional security measures cannot keep up with changing cyber threats as the communication infrastructure becomes more complicated. Therefore, this paper investigates the potential of a GAI-enhanced neuro-symbolic quantum framework for building security systems that are strong, scalable, and self-sufficient. This method improves threat detection, encryption, and real-time adversarial defense by combining symbolic reasoning for logic, deep learning for pattern recognition, and quantum intelligence to accelerate computations.

10.1109/NAECON49338.2021.9696431,Dynamic Speed Estimation of Moving Objects from Camera Data,"Recent advances in computer vision techniques have led to increasing interest in the use of vision as the only mechanism to estimate the vehicle speed in certain applications. The challenge of making accurate estimations of distances and speeds arises from the discrete nature of video sensors that project the 3D world into a 2D discrete plane. This work will study the concept of estimating the speed of an object by only using the camera data. Rather than using a separate mechanism dependent on camera specifications, we consider a convolutional neural network fed recurrent neural network to estimate the speed at each time step. The video data can be fed to an object detection algorithm to extract the features and patterns in the videos. The network architecture is designed to make use of pre-trained object detection models to extract features from camera video feed and embed them into a data cluster. This cluster can represent the spatiotemporal information of the objects in the video frames. A recurrent neural network is then used to learn the association of the motion speed values with respect to the changes in the features within the cluster. Based on this structure, both the object detector and the recurrent neural network can be trained end-to-end to detect and estimate the speed of objects in videos. This network architecture would not require additional sensors for calibration, while providing a cost-effective solution for mobile robotic applications such as autonomous ground vehicles or drones. The proposed methodology, network architecture and its components will be discussed in detail. This paper also presents a video data case study and preliminary results to demonstrate the development and use of the speed estimation network. Some future work is planned to improve the algorithm accuracy and computing efficiency of the proposed architecture."
10.1109/NER49283.2021.9441244,Targeting post-stroke walking automaticity with a propulsion-augmenting soft robotic exosuit: toward a biomechanical and neurophysiological approach to assistance prescription,"Human locomotor control ranges on a spectrum of automaticity, from highly automatic strategies that require minimal cognitive input, to attention-demanding executive-control strategies. The neural circuitry that facilitates automaticity is impaired by stroke, resulting in a compensatory shift toward executive-control, as well as reduced paretic propulsion and increased step-to-step variability. We have developed a soft robotic exosuit to augment paretic propulsion by providing paretic plantarflexor assistance during the propulsive phase of walking. For this preliminary study, we hypothesized that changes in walking automaticity would accompany changes in paretic propulsion. When plantarflexor assistance timings were tuned to reduce propulsion variability-a biomechanical measure of automaticity-a -14.7±2.5% variability reduction was accompanied by increased paretic propulsion (%Δ+6.4±6.3%) and prefrontal cortex activity (A oxygenated hemoglobin:+ 1.08E-04±1.05E-04 M mm). When plantarflexor assistance timings were instead tuned to reduce prefrontal cortex activity-a neurophysiological measure of automaticity-a -1.3E-05±1.1E-05 M mm decrease in oxygenated hemoglobin was accompanied by both increased paretic propulsion (%Δ:+4.4±8.1 %) and reduced propulsion variability (%Δ:-3.7±19.3%). Biomechanical and neurophysiological measures of automaticity are sensitive to exosuit assistance timing changes, but are differentially affected, highlighting the need for individualized tuning."
10.1109/NextComp63004.2024.10779903,A Review of PFCP Cyber Attacks in 5G Standalone for Robotic Telesurgery Services,"The emergence of fifth-generation technology (5G) has revolutionised telecommunication networks, offering enhanced mobile broadband, ultra-reliable (eMBB), ultra-low-latency communications (uRLLC), and massive machine-type communication (mMTC) service classes. This breakthrough has garnered significant attention and investment worldwide, driving innovation and growth in the digital era. However, the adoption of cloud-based 5G core (5GC) networks, while offering scalability and deployment flexibility, has posed challenges to meeting stringent latency requirements, particularly for uRLLC services specifically for robotic telesurgery. To address this problem, mobile network operators (MNOs) have turned to edge computing (EC), using the control and user plane separation (CUPS) architecture introduced in the third-generation partnership project (3GPP) release 14 specification. This architecture enables the deployment of the user plane function (UPF) closer to users, reducing latency, and improving quality of service (QoS). However, the deployment of the UPF as a standalone node on the edge of the network exposes the packet forwarding control protocol (PFCP) to cybersecurity attacks, which pose risks to telesurgery services and could even lead to loss of life. In the existing literature, only a few techniques focus on minimising these attacks when the UPF is deployed on the edge of the network far from the 5GC. Therefore, this paper reviews PFCP attacks and explores machine learning (ML) techniques to mitigate these security threats. This paper further provides recommendations and future research directions for mitigating these attacks."

This system is well-studied in neuroscience, and its efficiency and versatility make it attractive for applications in robotics and machine learning.While continuous attractor networks (CANs) successfully model entorhinal grid cells for encoding physical space, integrating both continuous spatial and abstract spatial computations into a unified framework remains challenging. Here, we attempt to bridge this gap by proposing a mechanistic model for versatile information processing in the entorhinal-hippocampal formation inspired by CANs and Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), a neuro-symbolic computing framework. The novel grid-cell VSA (GC-VSA) model employs a spatially structured encoding scheme with 3D neuronal modules mimicking the discrete scales and orientations of grid cell modules, reproducing their characteristic hexagonal receptive fields.In experiments, the model demonstrates versatility in spatial and abstract tasks: (1) accurate path integration for tracking locations, (2) spatio-temporal representation for querying object locations and temporal relations, and (3) symbolic reasoning using family trees as a structured test case for hierarchical relationships. © 2025 IEEE."

Our Study in attempt to introduces the conceptual design of a charging station for an AV to the convenience and efficiency of automated operation, enabling vehicles to charge themselves, thereby increasing their autonomy. This study proposed the scientometric-based product design approach. We performed design background seeking by scientometric and descriptive analysis in the first stage. As expected, in the previous designs, the motion of robotic arms is limited due to the spherical range of motion, and therefore it causes the arms could not reach constantly depending on the height of the arm. We propose a design plan containing something new and different from previous designs in the second stage. The concept design that we propose includes an energy source for the charging station that uses renewable energy from a solar cell device, which is designed using a hybrid system, which can be connected off-grid or on-grid. Then, the installation of the charging connector from the dispenser to the vehicle is carried out autonomously through the Robotic arm joints, which have a five-degree of freedom (5-DOF) design to make it more flexible."

10.1109/OCEANS58557.2025.11104515,iCADME: A Modular Autonomy Architecture for Robotic Heterogeneous Networks in Communication-Limited Environments,"Autonomy and cooperation are essential features in robotic networks, especially in the underwater domain where communications are severely limited. Robots should be able to carry out any assigned task autonomously, yet cooperate with other robots when allowed to by the environmental conditions. To enable this, there is a growing interest in robotic software solutions which are modular, scalable and easy to test. In this paper, we introduce iCADME, a novel autonomy architecture, which achieves such features thanks to a software eco-system which relies on a hierarchy of tasks, in charge of perception and decision-making, and of behaviour strategies, which act as the interface towards the robot lower level control architecture. The modularity and the attention to the system configuration are instrumental for the user to reuse the software and to expand the task portfolio. Thanks to the strong decoupling between perception/decision-making and action, achieved also with the design of an interface layer with the external middleware, iCADME can be easily integrated with various planning and control systems and with different middleware software. On top of that, a behaviour trees (BTs) mission management system is introduced. BTs enable the building of complex missions by assembling a portfolio of tasks, with features of high modularity and reactivity. All these iCADME's features were succesfully tested during MEDASWAN23 trial. They are a step forward towards the actual use in the field of increasingly cooperative robotic networks."
10.1109/OCTA49274.2020.9151843,A Multi-agent architecture for modeling organizational planning against terrorist attacks in urban areas,"Nowadays the world is suffering from the emergence of a new concept of war, it is the asymmetric warfare created by the terrorists' new combat doctrine. As the plans to face classic enemies have become unusual against terrorism, this calls for innovative concepts and technologies to support the units and to improve the capability of leaders and structure their choices. In this paper, we propose a multi agent architecture for action planning against terrorist attacks.

We aim to create a multi-agent model that describes the relation between actors during the terrorist attack in order to find the best possible units distribution to neutralize the enemy."
10.1109/OJCOMS.2021.3081996,Multi-UAV Path Planning for Wireless Data Harvesting With Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Harvesting data from distributed Internet of Things (IoT) devices with multiple autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a challenging problem requiring flexible path planning methods. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that, in contrast to previous work, can adapt to profound changes in the scenario parameters defining the data harvesting mission, such as the number of deployed UAVs, number, position and data amount of IoT devices, or the maximum flying time, without the need to perform expensive recomputations or relearn control policies. We formulate the path planning problem for a cooperative, non-communicating, and homogeneous team of UAVs tasked with maximizing collected data from distributed IoT sensor nodes subject to flying time and collision avoidance constraints. The path planning problem is translated into a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), which we solve through a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, approximating the optimal UAV control policy without prior knowledge of the challenging wireless channel characteristics in dense urban environments. By exploiting a combination of centered global and local map representations of the environment that are fed into convolutional layers of the agents, we show that our proposed network architecture enables the agents to cooperate effectively by carefully dividing the data collection task among themselves, adapt to large complex environments and state spaces, and make movement decisions that balance data collection goals, flight-time efficiency, and navigation constraints. Finally, learning a control policy that generalizes over the scenario parameter space enables us to analyze the influence of individual parameters on collection performance and provide some intuition about system-level benefits."
10.1109/OJVT.2025.3574385,MMTraP: Multi-Sensor Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction in BEV,"Accurate detection and trajectory prediction of moving vehicles are essential for motion planning in autonomous driving systems. While traffic regulations provide clear boundaries, real-world scenarios remain unpredictable due to the complex interactions between vehicles. This challenge has driven significant interest in learning-based approaches for trajectory prediction. We present MMTraP: Multi-Sensor and Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction in BEV. This method integrates camera, LiDAR, and radar data to create detailed Bird's-Eye-View representations of driving scenes. Our approach employs a hierarchical vector transformer architecture that first detects and classifies vehicle motion patterns before predicting future trajectories through spatiotemporal relationship modeling. This work specifically focuses on vehicle interactions and environmental constraints. Despite its significance, multi-agent trajectory prediction and moving object segmentation are still underexplored in the literature, especially in real-time applications. Our method leverages multisensor fusion to obtain precise BEV representations and predict vehicle trajectories. Our multi-sensor fusion approach achieves the highest vehicle Intersection over Union (IoU) of 63.23% and an overall mean IoU (mIoU) of 64.63%, demonstrating its effectiveness in utilizing all available sensor modalities. Additionally, we demonstrate vehicle segmentation and trajectory prediction capabilities across various lighting and weather conditions. The proposed approach has been rigorously evaluated using the nuScenes dataset.

In this paper, we introduce a novel collaborative Simulation Twin (ST) strategy for control and autonomy on resource-constrained robots. The practical implementation of such a strategy entails a mobile robot system divided into a cyber (simulated) and physical (real) space separated over a communication channel where the physical robot resides on the site of operation guided by a simulated autonomous agent from a remote location maintained over a network. Building on top of the digital twin concept, our collaborative twin is capable of autonomous navigation through an advanced SLAM-based path planning algorithm, while the physical robot is capable of tracking the Simulated twin's velocity and communicating feedback generated through interaction with its environment. We proposed a prioritized path planning application to the test in a collaborative teleoperation system of a physical robot guided by ST's autonomous navigation. We examine the performance of a physical robot led by autonomous navigation from the Collaborative Twin and assisted by a predicted force received from the physical robot. The experimental findings indicate the practicality of the proposed simulation-physical twinning approach and provide computational and network performance improvements compared to typical remote computing (or offloading) and digital twin approaches."

10.1109/PIMRC59610.2024.10817447,Joint Communication-Motion Planning for UAV Swarm against Jamming with Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning,"In this paper, we investigate the joint communication-motion planning problem for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm in the presence of jammers. Specifically, we consider a cluster-based UAV swarm architecture, where multiple cluster member (CM) UAVs transmit messages to a cluster head (CH) UAV through air-to-air links affected by malicious jammers. Our objective is to maximize the sum uplink rate of the UAV swarm by optimizing the trajectories and the transmit power of all UAVs. To achieve this goal, we formulate a joint multi-UAV trajectories and transmit power optimization problem under speed, transmit power, trajectories and received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints. In order to solve the problem, we establish a Markov decision process (MDP). For the multi-agent environment and the high-dimensional continuous action space, we adopt a multi-agent twin delayed deep deterministic (MATD3) policy gradient-based algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the sum uplink rate of the UAV swarm compared to the baseline schemes."
10.1109/PLANS46316.2020.9110202,Exploring the Design Space of Lunar GNSS in Frozen Orbit Conditions,"We have witnessed a growing interest in lunar exploration missions in the last few years, with the announcement of NASA's Deep Space Gateway, the launch of several uncrewed missions and the involvement of private companies. However, there is currently no reliable means of accurate and instantaneous navigation in the vicinity of the Moon. This poses operational limitations on the autonomy of lunar robotic and small satellite missions. We present the preliminary results of a systems architecture study conducted on a new satellite navigation system orbiting the Moon that would effectively extend the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) space service volume to cislunar space. We constrain the analysis to lunar frozen orbits under J2, C22 and third-body perturbations, to achieve stable lunar orbits. The problem formulation includes the following design decisions: (1) Orbit semi-major axis, (2) Number of satellites, (3) Number of orbital planes, (4) Satellite phasing in adjacent planes, (5) Orbit eccentricity and (6) Argument of periapsis. The Borg Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) is used to optimize the satellite constellation design using multiple crossover and mutation operators that can adaptively be selected at runtime. The fitness function takes into account performance, cost, availability and station-keeping delta-V. Specifically, the performance metric assessment is based on the Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP), which is computed over a grid of 500 equidistant points on the lunar surface. The input satellite orbits used in the GDOP computation are obtained from high-fidelity orbit propagation using NASA's General Mission Analysis Toolbox (GMAT). The space segment cost model considers satellite constellation development and production costs. Single satellite costs are based on satellite dry mass estimates derived from the power budget analysis assuming a satellite lifetime of 10 years. The results of the study show that high-performing Lunar GNSS constellations relying on frozen orbits alone can be achieved with 20 satellites but they may be suboptimal for high-latitude regions."
10.1109/PSGEC66102.2025.11150990,Mingyue: A Multi-Agent System for Human-AI Collaborative Decision-Making Under Safety Constraints in Complex Power Grids,"To address the conflict between the high complexity and uncertainty of modern power systems and the extreme safety requirements for dispatch decision-making, this paper introduces ‘Mingyue,’ a multi-agent system for human-AI collaborative decision-making. Traditional dispatch methods rely on manual experience, which is inefficient and prone to errors. Conversely, applying general artificial intelligence, such as large language models (LLMs), directly to this safety-critical domain poses fundamental risks of factual hallucination and unreliable actions. The Mingyue system overcomes these challenges through three key innovations: 1) A unified knowledge representation framework for power dispatch that transforms vast, heterogeneous domain knowledge (e.g., regulations, case studies, and operational procedures) into a machine-readable and traceable knowledge base, providing a reliable foundation for all decisions. 2) A decoupled ‘Intent-Plan-Tool’ architecture that leverages LLMs for task planning while invoking a deterministic professional toolset for execution, fundamentally isolating the non-deterministic nature of AI from the precise control required in the physical world. 3) A hierarchical multi-agent collaborative mechanism for complex dispatch workflows, which automates end-to-end tasks through the coordination of specialized agents (e.g., safety supervision, decision-making, and operation agents). The system has been deployed in the Guangdong power grid, the world's largest provincial grid. Experimental results show that compared to traditional manual modes and standalone AI tools, Mingyue improves efficiency by over 85 % in key tasks such as risk analysis, emergency response, and operational ticket generation, significantly enhancing the safety and intelligence of power grid operations."
10.1109/QCNC64685.2025.00063,QPLAN: Deep Reinforcement Learning Assisted Quantum Network Planning,"Quantum networks attract increasing attention due to their unique advantages over classical networks. However, the challenge of efficiently and economically constructing reliable wide-area quantum networks remains unresolved. This problem, termed network planning, is typically modeled as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. Existing solver-based solutions for classical networks face scalability issues, while heuristic approaches that sacrifice optimality for scalability heavily rely on human expertise and lack generalizability. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated potential in adaptive decision-making for classical network planning. However, quantum networks introduce unique constraints due to their end-to-end entanglement distribution requirements. To address this, we propose a two-stage quantum network resource allocation framework, QPLAN, that combines multi-agent DRL with traditional optimization solvers. Our approach uses a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning strategy using graph neural networks (GNNs) and transformers for traffic flow and corresponding hardware resource allocation to minimize hardware cost while cooperatively satisfying problem constraints as much as possible. The output of the DRL algorithm is then used as an initial input to prune the solution space, ""warm-starting"" the ILP solver and further improving the solution. This hybrid approach effectively reduces manual effort and enhances scalability. Experimental results show that our method yields near-optimal solutions with better scalability than only using ILP solvers."

Embodied AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with the environment through a physical or virtual body (e.g., robots, virtual agents), enabling perception, decision-making, and action in real or simulated spaces. We focus on their applications in robotic learning and control. By critically comparing the capabilities of mainstream simulation platforms such as Habitat and Isaac Gym, the study identifies core trade-offs between physical realism and computational efficiency. It further analyzes transfer methodologies, including domain randomization, domain adaptation, and hybrid techniques, highlighting their effectiveness and limitations in dynamic and unstructured environments. The review also investigates the emerging role of large multimodal models, such as PaLM-E and RT-2, in bridging semantic understanding with robotic action. While these models offer significant improvements in generalization and task planning, challenges remain in achieving real-time performance and physical grounding. The findings suggest that simulation fidelity alone does not guarantee successful transfer, hybrid transfer methods outperform single-strategy approaches in complex settings, and large language models hold promise for enhancing robot intelligence but must be optimized for embedded deployment.

However, these systems generally have shortages in two-folds, i.e., (1) redundant moves of shelves, and (2) unavoidable manual operations. To overcome these shortages, an alternative solution is using heterogeneous robots (fetch and freight robots) cooperatively to accomplish sorting tasks. In this field, the existing works mostly focus on the design of robots, while there is no public literature (to our best knowledge) which studies how to coordinately schedule a large number of fetch and freight robots. To fit this blank, this paper first proposes a cooperative algorithm to schedule hundreds of heterogeneous robots. The algorithm adopts a cloud-edge-terminal architecture, where the cloud is responsible for allocating tasks and robots, the edge computing units monitor the status of each regional area, while the terminals (robots) are able to plan their own paths (guided by the edge computing units) and resolve conflicts by bidding mechanisms.

Under a sequential decision-making framework, egocentric navigation can naturally be represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, social navigation additionally requires reasoning about the hidden beliefs of others, inherently leading to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where agents lack direct access to others’ mental states. Inspired by Theory of Mind and Epistemic Planning, we propose (1) a neuro-symbolic model-based reinforcement learning architecture for social navigation, addressing the challenge of belief tracking in partially observable environments; and (2) a perspective-shift operator for belief estimation, leveraging recent work on Influence-based Abstractions (IBA) in structured multi-agent settings."

While socially assistive robots integrated with serious games show promise, traditional robotic platforms often lack the flexibility to adapt dynamically to users’ fluctuating cognitive abilities and engagement levels. We propose a novel self-adaptive framework that combines the MAPE-K (Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Execute, Knowledge) control loop with the CORTEX cognitive robotics architecture. Implemented on the EBOv2 robotic platform, our system supports two popular serious games—""Simon Says"" for attention and memory training, and ""Pasapalabras"" (a word quiz game) for semantic and linguistic stimulation. Specialized software agents within CORTEX dynamically modify these games’ structural and parametric elements, guided by multimodal inputs such as user performance metrics and emotional cues. A simulation-based evaluation using profiles derived from established cognitive models (ranging from high cognitive capacity to mild impairment) demonstrates the system’s adaptability and reliability. Our measurements show latency well below the 200 ms threshold—ensuring seamless real-time reconfiguration. Beyond response times, the adaptive difficulty mechanism effectively tailors challenge levels to each user profile, stabilizing within five sessions and improving overall engagement metrics compared to non-adaptive configurations. Users in the simulated high-capacity profile consistently progressed to advanced difficulty levels without frustration. In contrast, users with milder impairments benefited from gentle ramps in a challenge that enhanced task completion rates. These findings underscore the technical feasibility and potential therapeutic value of agent-based robotic systems for personalized cognitive stimulation.

LLM-based robots are a way to realize embodied intelligence, but they still lack a general control paradigm to achieve embodied robot. We propose LAC (LLM-based Agents as the Controller), a new formulation to enable embodied robots to autonomously react to high-level tasks like humans. Specifically, the controller in LAC is LLM-based agents that can plan, decompose tasks and make decisions based on linguistic input. Two agents operate in parallel within the controller to replicate both instinctive reaction and deep consideration. The output of the controller consists of linguistic parameters that activate task-specific tools, enabling autonomous execution of low-level actions. LAC translates multi-modal feedback information into linguistic messages, which are then transmitted back to the controller to establish a closed-loop control flow. Once equipped with appropriate tools, the proposed LAC can be applied across various applications. A straightforward simulated office task, TASK0, illustrates the successful completion of the embodied task by LAC. Furthermore, testing five comparative LLMs on TASK0 also demonstrates that LAC serves as a potential test platform for validating the capability of LLMs to function as the cognitive center of embodied robots."

Among its varied applications, one of the most crucial fields is the control of rigid-structure robotic manipulators. However, conventional robotic arms are typically highly specialized and rigid in design, which limits their adaptability to different tasks and environments. One promising solution to this challenge is the development of modular robotic manipulators. This work proposes a cost-effective approach for implementing a n-Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) manipulator. It introduces a design consisting of 3D printable links that allow for flexible assembly into custom configurations. A reconfigurable software architecture is presented, enabling automated generation of description and configuration files. This facilitates visualization, planning, and control of various custom configurations. The solution leverages the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS) as a digital twin for the modular setups. Additionally, it explores the development of hardware modules accompanying each link, facilitating independent joint control irrespective of motor type. Communication with ROS software is achieved via a CAN-based OpenCyphal network."
10.1109/RoEduNet68395.2025.11208388,A Multi - Agent Framework for Auditing Smart Contracts,"Smart contracts power a vast array of blockchain applications, securing billions of dollars on decentralized finance, but their immutable nature turns every vulnerability into a permanent exploitable liability. Although automated security tools can efficiently detect many issues, their high false positive rates and lack of trust still require manual audits, which are costly and introduce deployment delays. In this paper, we present an end to end AI augmented auditing framework that leverages a multi-agent pipeline for comprehensive vulnerability detection and automated exploit generation. First, we review existing approaches such as static analysis, fuzzing, symbolic execution, formal verification, and machine learning methods, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and real world deployment experience. Building on this survey, we introduce a multi agent architecture composed of a Distributor Agent, an Attack Planner Agent, an Exploit Generator Agent, and an Audit Report Generator Agent. The pipeline ingests smart contract source code, documen-tation, and test suites to outline stepwise attack strategies and synthesize ready to compile Solidity exploit code. Exploits are compiled and validated in a containerized environment, enabling automated verification of attack effectiveness. We outline a validation strategy for future work, more specifically, applying the pipeline to capture the flag challenges and online bug bounty platforms, and we describe plans for prompt fine tuning, retrieval augmented generation, and formal verification integration to further enhance detection accuracy and exploit reliability. Our proposed framework promises a more comprehensive, scalable, and cost effective approach to smart contract security verification."

Semantic analysis is practical for the determination of the accessible and restricted areas for the robot motion planning, as well as for the detecting the position of the robot relative to known landmarks. Mobile robots often move in limited areas such as industrial workshops, enclosed industrial facility areas, airports, etc. Any similar territory can have its own exclusive set of objects. Therefore, the work evaluates the ability of neural networks to learn on small datasets with unique classes. We have collected and annotated the images of an enclosed industrial facility area to create the training and test datasets. Using the created dataset, we have trained and tested several neural network architectures for the object detection and image segmentation. We have evaluated the performance of the considered architectures and determined the best performing networks for our task. Best results for the object detection problem were shown by YOLOv4+CSP network (91.6% mAP and 70 FPS on 1080Ti); best results for the semantic segmentation were shown by OCR architecture with 84.1% overall IoU and 4.1 FPS performance. Using these architectures, we plan to build a robotic vehicle technical vision system in the future."

At the same time, there has been a marked increase in demand for better, more environmentally friendly farming methods. The current study uses machine learning applied to computer vision to develop a system that is able to identify and classify plants as either crops or weeds with a view to enabling robotic appliances to perform plant cultivation and monitoring. This is performed using a state-of-the-art object detection architecture known as Faster R-CNN, trained and tested on a publicly available crop/weed dataset. Various configurations of this network were compared and tested on a Raspberry Pi 4 in order to gauge the usefulness of this detection system in field conditions, in terms of both speed and accuracy. The results show that relatively high speed predictions are possible while using low resolution images, but that significantly more accurate results can be obtained by using larger images, albeit with a significant speed penalty. Depending on the application, however, the low resolution inference may already be adequate."

This is what we currently broadly call now AI and neurotechnology. Two bright examples are ResNet inspired by the projections of a mammalian cortical column and U-Net with close to ResNet ideas and topology. The other interesting cortical column inspired NN architecture is hierarchical temporal memory introduced by the Numenta company. These brain or neuro inspired approaches are widely used in machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, path planning and broader in robotics.In the neurotechnology field I want to reference a lot of interesting and projects dedicated to BCI. Starting from works of Miguel Nicolelis where researchers connected the robotic hand via a computer system with a motor cortex of a monkey and later Lebedev group demonstrated the adaptation of a mammalian brain to create the representation of robotic limb extending biological limbs. I want to pay the special attention to works of Kevin Warwick that implemented invasive nervous system to nervous system interface and the robot managed by neurons of a rat brain developed and trained during the experiment.The commercial company Neuralink recently demonstrated the most advanced 1536-channel BCI exploiting wireless Blue-tooth interface to record and process a brain activity. Elon Musk in his Neuralink presentation last year demanded that one of the nearest goals of the company is spinal cord injury and the recovery of the lost motor control of limbs. Several projects in neurorehabilitation targeted to the motor control demonstrated recently important success using medical programmed neurostimulators.The perspective but currently in early state of the development is the direction of neurosimulation based models that could be used for the robotic system control (exoskeleton) or as neuroprosthesis as the part of closed loop system for example projects simulating the spinal cord, where I can see interesting future opportunities both in medicine and robotics."

State-of-the-art agricultural systems are capable of capturing 3D data of individual crops and reconstructing digital twins. A prominent issue in the field is extracting information about the subject plant from the point cloud data, particularly classifying organelle. To address this problem, a deep neural network with a PointNet-like architecture is proposed to identify organelle of the subject plant. Using datasets of plant images taken from an RGB-camera attached to a robotic arm, 3D point cloud data is generated with structure-from-motion photogrammetry techniques, which is used to train a network to segment local regions of the model. A proof-of-concept segmentation network is presented, trained using a large multi-view dataset of avocados images to identify organelle such as the seed, interior pulp, and exterior skin.

These solutions are built on state-of-the-art agricultural systems that are capable of capturing 3D data of individual crops and constructing digital twins. Prominent issues in the field include extracting meaningful information about the subject plant from the point cloud data and accurately picking fruits in real-world settings. Previously, a deep neural network with PointNet-like architecture was trained to segment plant organelle using 3D point cloud data, allowing for structure identification and monitoring capabilities. However, enabling autonomous plant harvesting remains a challenge. A promising method for robotic systems to address this is sim-to-real transfer learning, where an agent is trained to perform tasks in a realistic simulation environment and deployed in the real-world. In order to enable agricultural tasks such as fruit picking, this work introduces Sim2Fruit, a ROS2 package that integrates plant segmentation algorithms with reinforcement learning (RL) agents to train a robotic arm system in harvesting simulations powered by Gazebo.

To achieve such a goal, it is necessary that they are able to perform trustworthy and legible behaviors. In this work, we propose a cognitive architecture that integrates multimodal perception, symbolic reasoning, memory-enhanced decision-making, and adaptive interaction strategies to create an explainable and engaging dietary assistant. The key idea is to provide the robot with the capability to iteratively interact with a user and adapt the dietary plan based on their current state, preferences, and food restrictions, while conveying explicitly the inner decision and thought process. To achieve this, we employ a graph-enhanced Large Language Model (LLM), which queries contextual, semantic, and episodic acquired knowledge to generate personalized meal recommendations. These must subsequently be refined through a verification process that enforces constraints such as caloric limits and ingredient intolerances, ensuring dietary adherence. To have a transparent decision-verification process, the robot has to progressively verbalize the reasoning process while providing justifications for the recommendations to also enhance the user's trust. Non-verbal context-relevant movements are also generated to allow the robot to express empathy. We expect our framework to increase user trust, engagement, and adherence to healthy behaviors, allowing SARs to function as credible and effective health assistants. © 2025 IEEE."

A significant part of the numerous uses of robotics and many countries deciding that whether it’s possible to give identity to the anthropomorphic robots. Different industries hospitals are using the robots. The robots are not limited to these two applications even different sectors are using the different robots according to their needs. Mostly robots are performing the tasks which are difficult for human being. The basic robotic arms, known as three link manipulators, are still in use in micro-to-macro applications, such as chip production. In the field of robotics, robotic instrumentation is essential because without sensors, actuators, and detectors, robots cannot interact with their surroundings. In this paper soft computing also discussed in detail. In this paper the disturbance occur in the closed loop also being discussed. There have been tests, comparisons, and simulations done.GA doesn’t have to be an expert in the system. Even in cases when the population is quite big, the evolutionary process converges too soon. The robotic arm reaches the desired location within the simulated time, demonstrating good performance. Since the evolution function thoroughly tests all potential input spaces, the performance is ideal across the board.

Unlike previous works, this work aims to remove constraints on the learned symbols such as a fixed number of interacted objects or pre-defined symbolic structures. The proposed architecture can learn symbols for single objects and relations between them in a unified manner. The architecture is an encoder-decoder network with a binary activation layer followed by self-attention layers. Experiments are conducted in a robotic manipulation setup with a varying number of objects. Results showed that the robot successfully encodes the interaction dynamics between a varying number of objects using the discovered symbols. We also showed that the discovered symbols can be used for planning to reach symbolic goal states by training a higher-level neural network."

Though static path-planning and taskallocation algorithms have provided the basis for how autonomous vehicles are guided within structured environments, those approaches usually fail to contend with indeterminacy outside of their modelled world, where there is dynamic obstacle appearance and changing task requirements, thus raising inefficiencies and costs of operations. To address these issues, the paper introduces a new multi-agent coordination system that uses a hybrid A* algorithm, integrating path planning with sophisticated detection methods for dynamic obstacles and improving superior task allocation. The system is supposed to provide improvements in real-time coordination in industries of autonomous vehicles to achieve efficient management of tasks and paths in changing environments. We integrate the latest in machine learning techniques for improved and real-time updates within the changes of the vehicle routing process based on both immediate sensory input and environmental interactions. Simulations show that our system performs the task much faster than classic systems: up to 30% improvement in completing tasks compared with classic models, and an average improvement of 25% in allround energy efficiency. It intelligently integrates machine learning techniques with real-time data processing. With the ability to scale up or down, or to adapt itself, this system addresses the chief challenges existing methods face and could revolutionize logistics operations within any industry."
10.1109/SMARTCOMP52413.2021.00041,REPlanner: Efficient UAV Trajectory-Planning using Economic Reinforcement Learning,"Advances in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) design and capability, as well as decreases in the manufacturing cost, have opened up applications of UAVs in various fields, including surveillance, firefighting, cellular networks, and delivery purposes. The uniqueness of UAVs in systems creates a novel set of trajectory or path planning and coordination problems. Environments include many more points of interest (POIs) than UAVs, with obstacles and no-fly zones. We introduce REPlanner, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm inspired by economic transactions to distribute tasks among UAVs. This system revolves around an economic theory, in particular an auction mechanism where UAVs trade assigned POIs. We formulate the path planning problem as a multi-agent economic game, where agents can cooperate and compete for resources. We then translate the problem into a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which is solved using a reinforcement learning (RL) model deployed on each agent. As the system computes task distributions via UAV cooperation, it is highly resilient to any change in the swarm size. Our proposed network and economic game architecture can effectively coordinate the swarm as an emergent phenomenon while maintaining the swarm’s operation. Evaluation results prove that REPlanner efficiently outperforms conventional RL-based trajectory search."

Severely motor impaired people who have lost muscle control could benefit from this technique to control assistive devices, which support them in daily life. However, non-invasive BMIs can distinguish only a few different commands with relatively high error rates, which makes the asynchronous control of a robot with multiple degrees of freedom challenging. Here, we introduce a novel robotic grasping system, which combines scene recognition techniques and autonomous path planning with user interaction instantiated by a hybrid control system based on the electroencephalogram and the electrooculogram. The results show that healthy subjects can reliably perform a grasp-and-place task, arranging four objects at defined positions within 133-331s (193.6 ±61.5s), while they require only a few corrections. Our robot control platform proved to work solely with electrophysiological control signals and thus, constitutes a basis to perform various robot actions initiated by motor-impaired people."

10.1109/SMC53654.2022.9945350,PyMES: Distributed Manufacturing Execution System for Flexible Industry 4.0 Cyber-Physical Production Systems,"Industry 4.0 production systems have to support flexibility in products, processes, and production resources. To meet the required level of flexibility, Industry 4.0 production systems have to be capable of interpreting and executing production plans, which consist of generic actions (such as robotic manipulations or transport of material and products). In industrial practice, Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) together with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are usually responsible for such tasks. This paper proposes a new architecture of MES implemented in Python that is able to verify, interpret, and execute production plans automatically generated by an AI planner. Moreover, the proposed MES supports running in a distributed way in several instances, where each instance is able to interpret a location-specific part of a production plan. All MES instances are synchronized and the current global or partial (per each instance) production progress can be observed via HTTP/REST API. The proposed approach is demonstrated in practice on the Industry 4.0 Testbed use-case, utilized for evaluation."

While there have been attempts at using vision-based techniques for these tasks, they mostly use planogram compliance for detection of any anomalies, a technique that has been found lacking in robustness and scalability. Moreover, existing systems rely on human intervention to perform corrective actions after detection. In this paper, we present Co-AD, a Concept-based Anomaly Detection approach using a Vision Transformer (ViT) that is able to flag misplaced objects without using a prior knowledge base such as a planogram. It uses an auto-encoder architecture followed by outlier detection in the latent space. Co-AD has a peak success rate of 89.90% on anomaly detection image sets of retail objects drawn from the RP2K dataset, compared to 80.81% on the best-performing baseline of a standard ViT auto-encoder. To demonstrate its utility, we describe a robotic mobile manipulation pipeline to autonomously correct the anomalies flagged by Co-AD. This work is ultimately aimed towards developing autonomous mobile robot solutions that reduce the need for human intervention in retail store management."
10.1109/SMC53992.2023.10394276,2D Ultrasound-Guided Visual Servoing for In-Plane Needle Tracking in Robot-Assisted Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy,"Ultrasound (US)-guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy is a surgical procedure for large kidney stone removal through an incision in the patient's back. To gain kidney access, the surgeon steers a needle towards the kidney while simultaneously controlling the position and orientation of a US probe to keep the needle in the image plane. To successfully reach the kidney while avoiding delicate structures, a significant level of skill and precision is required. To alleviate the surgeon's cognitive workload, robot-assisted needle tracking can be implemented to autonomously track the needle in the US images and adjust the US probe's position and orientation such that the same portion of the needle is visible in the images. This paper presents a US-guided visual servoing (VS) algorithm to track the translation and rotation of a needle in a plane. Image features representing the desired pose of the needle in the image are defined, through which an interaction matrix is devised to relate the rate of the change of the image features in US images to the required position and orientation of the US probe connected to a robotic manipulator. Experimental results in 4 experimental scenarios in a water tank demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in tracking the needle in real-time with an accuracy of 2.6 mm with a control rate of 20 Hz. Although VS has been used to track surgical targets in the past, this paper proposes the first implementation of VS for needle tracking in longitudinal US images subjected to 3-DOF motion in a plane without any prior knowledge of needle trajectory or additional position sensors."

10.1109/SPIN52536.2021.9566102,Development of Behavior based Robot manipulation using Actor-Critic architecture,"Developing behavior based robotic manipulation is a very challenging but necessary task to be solved, especially for humanoid and social robots. Fundamental robotic tasks such as grasping, pick and place, trajectory following are at present solved using conventional forward and inverse kinematics (IK), dynamics and trajectory planning, whereas we learn these complex tasks using past experiences. In this paper, we explore developing behavior based robotic manipulation using reinforcement learning, more specifically learning directly from experiences through interactions with the real world and without knowing the transition model of the environment. Here, we propose a multi agent paradigm to gather experiences from multiple environments in parallel along with a model for populating new generation of agents using Evolutionary Actor-Critic Algorithm (EACA). The agents are of actor-critic architecture and both of them comprises of general purpose neural networks. The actor-critic architecture enables the model to perform well both in high dimensional state space and high dimensional action space which is very crucial for all robotic applications. The proposed algorithm is benchmarked with respect to different multi agent paradigm but keeping the agent’s architecture same. Reinforcement learning, being highly data intensive, requires the use of the CPU and GPU cores to be done judiciously for sampling the environment as well as for training, the details of which have been described here. We have run rigorous experiments for learning joint trajectories on the open gym based KUKA arm manipulator, where our proposed method achieves learning stability within 300 episodes, as compared to the state-of-the-art actor-critic and Advanced Asynchronous Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithms both of which take more than 1000 episodes for learning the same task, showing the effectiveness of our proposed model."
10.1109/SSCI47803.2020.9308498,PSO Trajectory Planner Using Kinematic Controllers that Ensure Smooth Differential Robot Velocities,"A multi-agent differential robot system requires a definite algorithm to behave as a swarm with goal searching capabilities. The classic Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is designed for particles with no mass or physical dimensions unlike differential robots. Therefore, it cannot be directly used to search for a goal using a robotic swarm. We propose the use of the PSO as a trajectory planner to enable the agents to collectively find the optimal path to a goal. The proposed PSO trajectory planner uses multiple known parameters such as inertia weight, a constriction parameter, two scaling factors and two random weighing factors (for the cognitive and social components of the PSO) optimized for differential robots. The planner takes into account the restrictions derived from the kinematic equations of the robotic agents and the finite dimensions of the search space. For that purpose, it is coupled with the necessary controllers to map particle velocities into smooth and continuous differential robot velocities. Four different controllers were tested, including the Transformed Unicycle Controller (TUC), Transformed Unicycle with LQR (TUC-LQR), Transformed Unicycle with LQI (TUC-QI), and a Lyapunov-stable Pose Controller (LSPC). The TUC-LQI controller outperformed the others in terms of achieving smooth continuous differential robot velocities, while following the paths generated by the PSO trajectory planner."
10.1109/SSCI52147.2023.10371893,GLocal: A Hybrid Approach to the Multi-Agent Mission Re-Planning Problem,"Multi-agent systems can be prone to failures during the execution of a mission, depending on different circumstances, such as the harshness of the environment they are deployed in. As a result, initially devised plans for completing a mission may no longer be feasible, and a re-planning process needs to take place to re-allocate any pending tasks. There are two main approaches to solve the re-planning problem (i) global re-planning techniques using a centralized planner that will redo the task allocation with the updated world state and (ii) decentralized approaches that will focus on the local plan reparation, i.e., the re-allocation of those tasks initially assigned to the failed robots, better suited to a dynamic environment and less computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach, named GLocal, that combines both strategies to exploit the benefits of both, while limiting their respective drawbacks. GLocal was compared to a planner-only, and an agent-only approach, under different conditions. We show that GLocal produces shorter mission make-spans as the number of tasks and failed agents increases, while also balancing the tradeoff between the number of messages exchanged and the number of requests to the planner."

In previous works, we defined an Edge/Cloud-based IoRT and communications architecture for heterogeneous multi-agent systems that was applied to search and rescue missions (SAR-IoCA). In this paper, we address the integration of a remote mission control center, which performs path planning, teleoperation and mission supervision, into a ROS network. Furthermore, we present the UMA-ROS-Android app, which allows publishing smartphone sensor data, including audio and high definition images from the rear camera, and can be used by responders for requesting a robot to the control center from a geolocalized field position. The app works up to API 32 and has been shared for the ROS community. The paper offers a case study where the proposed framework was applied to a cooperative casualty evacuation mission with professional responders and an unmanned rover with two detachable stretchers in a high-fidelity exercise performed in Malaga (Spain) in June 2022."

The traditionally applied collective problem solving in such conditions is ineffective, because by the time the agreed decision is made it becomes irrelevant. In this regard, it is necessary to develop informational intelligent systems capable of relevantly simulating the collective reasoning of experts and offering recommendations to the user of the systems, reducing the time of his reaction to events occurring in the control object. For these purposes, hybrid intelligent multi-agent systems of heterogeneous thinking have been proposed. In this paper, the use of the laboratory prototype of such a system to solve one of the problems with dynamic environment is considered, namely regional power grid restoration planning after large-scale emergencies."

The paper discusses the phenomenon of cohesion, which occurs in long-term teams of specialists that jointly solve practical problems, as well as approaches to its multiagent computer modeling based on the exchange of information about agent's interests, knowledge, experience, development and coordination of common goals, values, norms, means and methods of activity. These mechanisms will simplify the process of integrating heterogeneous intelligent agents into a single system, which is especially important when they are created by independent development teams. The paper proposes the functional structure of the cohesive hybrid intelligent multi-agent system, the architectures of its agents, which are necessary for the implementation of the above mechanisms, and also considers the use of the system to solve the problem of planning the restoration of power supply after large-scale accidents."

10.1109/SWC62898.2024.00314,A Digital Twin Framework for Robot Grasp and Motion Generation,"Digital twin technology has demonstrated significant potential across various domains. In the field of robotics, manipulation, particularly robotic grasping, is fundamental to many applications. While artificial intelligence and deep learning methods have been employed to enhance grasp detection through visual perception, challenges such as data collection, the simulation-toreality (sim2real) gap, and motion planning safety still persist. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a comprehensive framework for digital twin-based robotic grasping and motion generation. Firstly, a digital twin synthetic data generation and domain randomization framework for robot manipulation is proposed to generate large-scale data to support deep learning training. Then, a hybrid training strategy combining synthetic and real data is proposed to reduce sim2real gap and enhance model performance in real-world perception. Finally, a dynamic digital twin working environment construction framework is proposed for motion generation and collision avoidance in changing environments. The proposed framework is widely applicable to various robotic tasks, offering a robust solution to the challenges faced in robotic manipulation. By leveraging digital twins, the efficiency, safety, and reliability of robotic operations will be enhanced across multiple robotic applications."

We show how our robotic system can handle multiple required tasks either sequentially, simultaneously, or concurrently. These tasks can be requested from internal processes or even from any external systems. Moreover, the robotic system can perform tasks in a discrete way or in a more intelligent way as the case of overlapping tasks based on the available resources. Regardless of the presence of the cloud, where the proposed architecture follows a fog paradigm to somehow enable the robot to achieve human-like capabilities, but this system works and is only partially affected if the cloud is lost. In this paper, we provide an overview of how this system outperforms while we are assuming that this architecture could be one of the most systems that can raising the bar for tasks demanded from a social service robot in the near future. However, the planning system is integrated with such a system as a service or as a black box to fully comply with the fog paradigm, and at the same time, an innovative method is presented to generate plans and carry out more than one task. Finally, a use case scenario describes how the system accepts and handles either sequential tasks or even merged tasks, and at the same time, how the system creates and executes plans to achieve these required tasks. We describe the most relevant terminology required to understand the proposed system."

Intellectualization of integrated management systems using robotic systems and complexes is presented comprehensively at the level of organizational, organizational and resource (taking into account their decomposition into organizational-information, organizational-cognitive, organizational-technical) and technical-technological processes. The main features of target processes in the life cycle of an integrated control system when including functional systems based on robotic systems and complexes in its composition are given. The complete group of target processes is considered. This approach is universal and is proposed to describe the structure of counteracting processes that have an artificial origin. In the lifecycle of integrated systems. The main content of developers' work on providing target processes at the stages of the integrated management system life cycle is considered: research, development, testing and operation of integrated management systems. It is shown that organizational and resource processes are the most flexible and capable of prompt adjustment at the operational stage. The article considers the development trend of integrated management systems as network-centric systems that allow for the reallocation of resources for the implementation of the main functions of the system. On a process basis, in accordance with the system triad, which includes the principles of openness, non-linearity and coherence, the conditions for implementing synergetic properties are considered. For this purpose, conditions should be created for the emergence of synergetic processes within the full group of processes aimed at implementing functionality. To create such conditions should be identified and promptly addressed vulnerability at the interface of the target process, to timely and qualitatively addressed the negative conditions for the implementation of opposing processes of external and internal origin, a rational way to be the formation and implementation of institutional, organizational, resource and technical-technological processes in the composition of their complete group. It is shown that such conditions should be planned and provided at the early stages of the integrated systems life cycle during research to determine the main organizational, technical, system and technological solutions. Organizational and resource processes can be quickly adjusted during operation. Technical and technological processes provided for at the stage of development of the control system do not have wide opportunities for their correction."

After the unforeseen outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the public demand for delivery services has increased. Mobile robotic systems inherently offer the potential for minimizing the amount of direct human-to-human interactions within the parcel delivery process. In this paper, we apply a system-level perspective for identifying key challenges and promising solution approaches for modeling, analysis, and optimization of UAV-aided parcel delivery. We present a system-of-systems model for UAV-enhanced parcel delivery to cope with higher capacity requirements induced by the COVID-19. The proposed system-of-systems consists of various complex aspects such as assigning and distributing delivery jobs, establishing and maintaining reliable communication links between the vehicles, as well as path planning and mobility control. In a proof of concept evaluation, we simulate the logistics performance and network communications of a hybrid delivery fleet composed of ground and aerial vehicles operating under pandemic induced constraints, such as the prioritization of time-critical deliveries like medical goods. Results indicate that network requirements for reliable communications within the delivery fleet can be met by existing network communications approaches. Furthermore, gains in delivery capacity induced by drone usage and a trade-off caused by prioritizing time-critical goods, therefore, resulting in a penalty for regular deliveries, are observed."

Prevalent approaches for rover simulation focus either on physical behaviors or visual scenarios. In this article, we present a simulator named MarsSim developed upon Robotic Operating System/Gazebo platform that supports both physical and visual realistic simulations. The interaction between the wheel and the rough deformable terrain is modeled with improved contact solutions, and the model is integrated into a refined physical simulation architecture as an independent terramechanics plugin. Using multiscale planetary data and representation models, Martian scenarios are constructed, considering characteristics in terms of the surface, rock, and atmosphere. Compared with experiments, the terramechanics plugin shows great modeling accuracy in fitting interactive force/torque and slip-sinkage phenomenon. The simulation of traverses with a six-wheeled planetary rover on Martian landscape is demonstrated with near-photoreal images, coupled with physical-realistic locomotive data under different terrains."
10.1109/TAES.2024.3365667,An Advanced Hexacopter for Mars Exploration: Attitude Control and Autonomous Navigation,"Mars exploration has recently witnessed major interest within the scientific community, particularly because unmanned aerial robotic platforms offer reliable alternatives for acquiring and collecting data and information from the Red Planet. However, the specific conditions of the Martian environment result in a restricted flight envelope when flying close to Mars and then landing on the surface of Mars. Therefore, in addition to the requirement to develop an aerial platform suitable for operations on Mars, autonomous navigation strategies and robust controllers are also needed for exploration tasks. It is argued that hexacopters with their relatively compact design represent a promising solution for autonomous exploration tasks on Mars, overcoming at the same time the limitations of wheel-based rovers. This research focuses on the design of a Mars hexacopter for a scouting mission in the Jezero region of Mars. The configuration and architecture of the hexacopter follow NASA conceptual study of the Mars science helicopter. Then, the mission profile for mapping the Belva crater is examined, followed by a detailed approach to implement and test observer-based navigation and control strategies. A comprehensive simulated experiments environment based on the integration of robot operating system and Ardupilot is also presented, used to validate the overall system architecture and mission parameters considering both the morphological shape of the explored crater and the atmospheric conditions of Mars."
10.1109/TAFE.2024.3379190,Advanced Robotic System for Efficient Pick-and-Place of Deformable Poultry in Cluttered Bin: A Comprehensive Evaluation Approach,"This research article presents an advanced robotic system designed for efficient pick-and-place of deformable poultry pieces from cluttered bins. The system incorporates a novel architecture with seamless integration of various modules, enabling the robot to handle deformable poultry with precision. It introduces a comprehensive evaluation approach to assess the system's performance, considering perception, state modeling, planning and control, gripping and manipulation. The experiments were conducted on two different samples of chicken pieces with varying weights and shapes, under complex and simple scenarios. Performance indicators, failure categories, and cycle time were used for evaluation. The evaluation revealed an overall success rate of 49.4% for picking and placing chicken pieces, with failure rates of 21.8% for perception, 30.7% for gripping, and 11% for manipulation modules. These results highlight areas of improvement, particularly in object detection, grasp pose estimation in clutter, and gripper designs for deformable products, to create a robust pick-and-place solution. The proposed robotic system and evaluation method hold immense potential for revolutionizing the meat processing industry and other food processing sectors, making automation more efficient and adaptable to meet the increasing demand in the food industry."
10.1109/TAI.2023.3341833,A Novel Framework for Improved Grasping of Thin and Stacked Objects,"In this study, we propose a novel top–down grasping approach for robots that combines a deep high resolution convolutional neural network (DHRNet) and a multiview perception-based trajectory planning controller (MP-PC). Unlike the traditional encoder–decoder architecture, DHRNet preserves the high-resolution feature maps and integrates feature maps at different scales to ensure maximum retention of spatial information and its fusion with high-level semantic information. The MP-PC continuously adapts the trajectory planning of the robotic end-effector based on the outputs of the DHRNet in order to respond to situations with low confidence in the grasping detection. As a result, it improves the smoothness and accuracy of the trajectory and avoids entering singularities. We evaluate the performance of the DHRNet on the Cornell and Jacquard grasping datasets, achieving accuracies of $99.50$% and $94.80$%, respectively. In addition, the framework outperformed other methods in real-world experiments using a 7 degrees of freedom Franka Emika Panda robot, especially in scenarios with stacked and thin objects. The codes for this approach are available at https://github.com/USTCzzl/DHRNet-MP-PC/tree/master."
10.1109/TASE.2021.3077689,Attention-Driven Active Sensing With Hybrid Neural Network for Environmental Field Mapping,"In environmental monitoring programs, mobile robots have been widely deployed for remote sensing, with the end objective of monitoring and mapping out environmental fields. Complex characteristics and correlations in natural phenomena make it challenging to establish a reliable framework for mobile sensing and field mapping. Furthermore, constraints of onboard resources will limit the ability of mobile robots to cover a large area. This article focuses on the active sensing problem in environmental field mapping and particularly exploits the use of intrinsic interactions among multivariate spatiotemporal data. A novel deep neural network of a hybrid CNN-RNN model is employed to learn the monitored multivariate spatiotemporal field. Specifically, a set of attention mechanisms is designed and embedded in the network, which is able to adaptively capture parameterwise dependencies among the monitored heterogeneous parameters and spatial correlations in geolocations of a surveyed field. The weights of inferred attention facilitate explicit interpretation of the driving parameters and geolocations. Some subregions of interest in the surveyed field are specified by their spatial attention distribution and are actively sensed by following the proposed coverage path planner. Experiments are carried out using a real-world dataset with multisource environmental imagery from a remote sensing program. Experimental results are obtained, which demonstrate the superior mapping performance of the proposed systematical methodology compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, the proposed model is able to quantitatively reveal the driving monitored parameters and geolocations in a regression process. Note to Practitioners—This article was motivated by the need for a practical and systematic approach for reconstruction and planning to execute robotic active sensing (AS) in environmental field mapping. Field robotic applications are not maneuverable in comparison with indoor scenarios due to severe conflict between the need for long execution endurance in the field and the very limited onboard resources. Traditional AS planners normally use statistical model-based informative metrics, which may lead to model misspecification in real-world phenomena. The developed framework in this article yields a novel attention-driven metric to guide AS and mapping. It relies on an attention-based hybrid neural network that reveals the driving variables in terms of the heterogeneities and complexities in a natural environment. The high-priority regions are maximized in a coverage path depending on the inferred spatial attention distribution while maintaining the travel cost of the sensing robots within an available energy budget. Experiments using a remote sensing dataset validate the reliable performance of the proposed framework, in environmental field mapping."
10.1109/TASE.2021.3137769,Data-Driven Strategies for Hierarchical Predictive Control in Unknown Environments,"This article proposes a hierarchical learning architecture for safe data-driven control in unknown environments. We consider a constrained nonlinear dynamical system and assume the availability of state-input trajectories solving control tasks in different environments. In addition to task-invariant system state and input constraints, a parameterized environment model generates task-specific state constraints, which are satisfied by the stored trajectories. Our goal is to use these trajectories to find a safe and high-performing policy for a new task in a new, unknown environment. We propose using the stored data to learn generalizable control strategies. At each time step, based on a local forecast of the new task environment, the learned strategy consists of a target region in the state space and input constraints to guide the system evolution to the target region. These target regions are used as terminal sets by a low-level model predictive controller. We show how to i) design the target sets from past data and then ii) incorporate them into a model predictive control scheme with shifting horizon that ensures safety of the closed-loop system when performing the new task. We prove the feasibility of the resulting control policy, and apply the proposed method to robotic path planning, racing, and computer game applications. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the challenge of designing safe controllers for autonomous systems navigating through new environments. We consider scenarios where trajectory data from control tasks in different environments is available to the control designer. Possible applications include autonomous vehicles racing on new tracks or robotic manipulators performing tasks in the presence of new obstacles. Existing approaches to model-based control design for new environments generally use trajectory libraries, systematically adapting stored trajectories to the constraints of the new environment. This typically requires a priori knowledge of the entire task environment as well as resources to store and maintain the growing library. This paper suggests a new hierarchical control approach, in which stored trajectories are used to learn high-level strategies that can be applied while solving the new task. The strategies are learned offline, and only the parameterized strategy function needs to be stored for online control. Strategies only require knowledge of the nearby task environment, and provide navigation guidelines for the system. In this paper we show how to find such strategies from previous task data and how to integrate them into a low-level controller to safely and efficiently solve the new task. We also show how to adapt the modular framework as needed for a user’s desired application. Simulation experiments in robotic manipulator, autonomous vehicle, and computer game examples suggest that our approach can be used in a wide range of applications. In future research, we will address how to adapt the method for time-varying or stochastic environments."
10.1109/TASE.2022.3178266,Merging Global and Local Planners: Real-Time Replanning Algorithm of Redundant Robots Within a Task-Priority Framework,"Task-priority inverse kinematics is a popular motion control algorithm which efficiently handles redundancy in robot manipulators. It has been recently extended in order to handle also set-based control objectives or inequality constraints. As any local motion planner it is prone to the occurrence of local minima. This work further extends set-based inverse kinematics by adding a motion planner in order to avoid such occurrence. Motion planners are usually computationally heavy especially in their eventual implementation with a task-priority architecture. To reduce this issue, the planner is implemented as a sampling-based algorithm which works in the reduced-dimensionality of the robot workspace applying Cartesian constraints only. The output trajectory is then checked against the inverse kinematics algorithm exploiting the redundancy and verifying the fulfillment of the joint-based task constraints. During the motion, inverse kinematics is then used also in real-time to ensure a reactive behavior to address, e.g., mismatch between the a-priori information and real-time perception acquisition. Also, the motion planner runs in background to adapt to changes in the environment or to accommodate incremental mapping. Comparison with alternative approaches are investigated and discussed. The most promising method is validated first in hundreds of numerical simulations to provide a solid statistical analysis and then experimentally with a Kinova Jaco2 7 DOFs manipulator equipped with an RGB-D sensor. Note to Practitioners—In this work we propose a motion planning algorithm that allows to effectively deploy robot manipulators in partially unstructured environments. It is structured in two layers: a Cartesian space global planner guarantees the feasibility of the trajectory with respect to potential obstacles in the environment, while a reactive local planner checks the feasibility at joint level. This architecture allows to define all the safety constraints both at Cartesian and joint space needed to operate in unstructured environments, while keeping the computation time lower with respect to standard approaches that define all the constraints in an offline global planner. The reduced computation time allows to effectively perform real-time replanning operations when needed, making the robotic system capable of adapting to a dynamic environment and suitable for sharing its workspace with human operators."
10.1109/TASE.2022.3183233,A Multiagent Mission Coordination System for Continuous Situational Awareness of Bushfires,"This paper devises a multi-agent Mission Coordinating Architecture (MCA) to achieve continuous situational awareness (SA) in bushfires, which can help with quick detection and accurate response to the hazards. In this paper, we use Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as instantiations of physical agents. MCA is a scalable architecture and aims to provide the UAVs with parallel mission plans, adopting a fire spread probability map and the Fuzzy C-means method to avoid mission overlap and duplicate information. The architecture is then enhanced by integrating a synchronized communication framework to facilitate UAVs’ adaptive cooperation and total flight time optimization. Furthermore, integrating the communication framework minimizes the number of deployed UAVs to fully cover the same area, saving considerable cost and energy compared to the Parallel Mode. The scalability challenge of the Parallel Mode, determining the required number of UAVs to cover the entire area, and the efficiency of the mission planning algorithm are thoroughly investigated and compared to the performance of the Communication Mode. Finally, the simulation results prove the MCA’s effectiveness in enhancing the UAVs’ exploration capability, resulting in comprehensive monitoring of all affected areas. Note to Practitioners—The proposed architecture in this research could offer flexibility to increase the number of UAVs on demand without requiring a change and adjustment of the parameters. Furthermore, a synchronized communication framework enhances MCA, enabling all UAVs to share their resources and exploit residual battery time to assist each other, manage the overall operation time, and reduce the total operation cost."
10.1109/TASE.2023.3259905,Reinforcement Learning-Based Switching Controller for a Milliscale Robot in a Constrained Environment,"This work presents a reinforcement learning-based switching control mechanism to autonomously move a ferromagnetic object (representing a milliscale robot) around obstacles within a constrained environment in the presence of disturbances. This mechanism can be used to navigate objects (e.g., capsule endoscopy, swarms of drug particles) through complex environments when active control is a necessity but where direct manipulation can be hazardous. The proposed control scheme consists of a switching control architecture implemented by two sub-controllers. The first sub-controller is designed to employ the robot’s inverse kinematic solutions to do an environment search for the to-be-carried ferromagnetic particle while being robust to disturbances. The second sub-controller uses a customized rainbow algorithm to control a robotic arm, i.e., the UR5 robot, to carry a ferromagnetic particle to a desired position through a constrained environment. For the customized Rainbow algorithm, Quantile Huber loss from the Implicit Quantile Networks (IQN) algorithm and ResNet are employed. The proposed controller is first trained and tested in a real-time physics simulation engine (PyBullet). Afterward, the trained controller is transferred to a UR5 robot to remotely transport a ferromagnetic particle in a real-world scenario to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. The experimental results on the UR5 robot show an average success rate of 98.86% over 30 episodes for randomly generated trajectories, demonstrating the viability of the proposed approach for real-life applications. In addition, two classical path finding approaches, Attractor Dynamics and the execution extended Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (ERRT), are also investigated and compared to the RL-based method. The proposed RL-based algorithm is shown to achieve performance comparable to that of the tested classical path planners whilst being more robust to deploy in dynamical environments. Note to Practitioners —Deep reinforcement learning methods have been widely applied in computer games and simulations. However, employing these algorithms for practical, real-world applications such as robotics becomes challenging due to the difficulty of obtaining training samples. This paper predominantly focuses on bridging the gap between simulations and the real-world implementation of a reinforcement learning algorithm for a robotic application in the context of miniaturized drug delivery robots and robotic capsule endoscopes. This paper presents the derivation and experimental validation of a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for controlling a magnetically-actuated small-scale robot within a simplified model of the large intestine in the presence of disturbances. We demonstrate the possibility of training a high-fidelity reinforcement learning algorithm fully within a simulated environment before deploying it as-is in a real-world scenario by carrying out different experiments and simulations. Implementing the presented control framework complements a large body of this work, and the results offer a feasibility study of using reinforcement learning algorithms in practice."
10.1109/TASE.2023.3282974,Task Space Compliant Control and Six-Dimensional Force Regulation Toward Automated Robotic Ultrasound Imaging,"Objective: We propose a general control framework for task space compliant motion and six-dimensional (6-D) force regulation towards automated robotic ultrasound (US) imaging. The framework endows a position-controlled robotic manipulator with the capability of accurate compliant motion in free space and accurate force control in motion-constrained environment. Methods: An intuitive six degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) admittance control model expressed in an arbitrary Cartesian body frame is mathematically derived with closed-form task space error mapping. Its practical implementation on widely-used collaborative manipulators is proposed to achieve full task space compliant behaviors and accurate 6-D force control. A hybrid control law is presented to achieve good motion accuracy in free space and improved coupled stability in motion-constrained environment. The coupled model of physical human-robot interaction is established and the reason for the improved coupled stability is analyzed through simulation. Results: Evaluation experiments on the proposed control framework were performed to show the effectiveness. The mean error of compliant trajectory following was less than 0.30 mm in free space. The mean relative force and moment control accuracy in three orthogonal directions was better than 0.5% and 0.8%, respectively. The improved coupled stability under the same model parameters was also confirmed by human-robot interaction experiments. Finally, an automated robotic US imaging experiment on a human volunteer in a real clinical scenario was carried out to show the potential application of our proposed framework. Conclusion: Experimental results have shown the advantages of the control framework, including satisfied force control accuracy, high accuracy of compliant motion, improved coupled stability, and system effectiveness on a human volunteer. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the increasing needs of automated ultrasound (US) scanning for both diagnostic and interventional purpose. Clinical sonographers suffer from repeated workload when performing diagnostic US imaging, which could benefit from automated robotic scanning. Robotic US imaging involves physical interaction between the robot end-effector (i.e., US transducer) and the human body. The dynamics of the interaction is regulated by the control law to guarantee the contact of the US transducer and the safety of the procedure. Most existing works have focused on regulating in-plane contact force in terms of the position without considering the compliance in other dimensions. However, it is not a trivial work to extend the positional compliance to six degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) compliance. As the prevalence of low-cost collaborative robotic arms in medical scenarios, how to perform 6-DoF compliant trajectory following and accurate six-dimensional (6-D) force control on these robotic arms becomes increasingly important. This paper gives a complete general solution to achieve 6-DoF compliant control and 6-D force regulation with accurate kinematics on a position-controlled robotic arm. A hybrid control law is proposed to switch the government of “instantaneous model” and “theoretical model” to achieve compliant motion accuracy in free space and improved coupled stability in motion-constrained environment. No expensive torque sensors and torque control interface are required. And no prior geometric knowledge about the scanning object is needed. We have demonstrated the application for robotic US imaging in a real clinical scenario."
10.1109/TASE.2023.3308785,Viewpoint Planning of Robotic Measurement System for Free-Form Surfaces Based on Visibility Cone Space Explorer,"Free-form surfaces have been widely used in industrial design and manufacturing. For the requirements of measurement efficiency and precision, robots and optical scanners are applied to measure free-form surface parts increasingly. Due to the complex geometry shapes and occlusions of these parts, how to plan accessible viewpoints of a scanner to achieve the expected coverage rate is a challenging task. This paper presents a novel viewpoint planning method based on the visibility cone space explorer (VP-VCSE) for robotic measurement systems with 7 degrees of freedom (7-DOF). A digital twin for the robotic measurement system is implemented to provide core services for robotic measurement tasks, including sensor simulation and collision detection. To generate initial candidate viewpoints, a novel mesh segmentation algorithm based on the hybrid mixture model is proposed, which is convenient to handle the triangular mesh of the target object. Visibility computation for a target object in given viewpoints is the key to dealing with the occlusion problem. For this purpose, a general visibility model of a structured-light scanner is presented to compute visible areas accurately. In order to reduce occlusions, a visibility cone space explorer is designed to search optimal candidate viewpoints considering inverse kinematics and physical collisions simultaneously. The viewpoint planning problem is formulated as a set covering optimization problem and a next-best-view operator is introduced to improve the efficiency of the genetic algorithm for searching the resultant viewpoint set, guaranteeing the expected coverage rate and data overlap rate. The simulation and experiment results for four different test models show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing methods in terms of the uncovered rate and the minimum number of viewpoints. Note to Practitioners—This paper addressed a viewpoint planning problem for the robotic measurement system with a binocular structured light 3D scanner mounted on the end effector of the robot, where a robot and a turntable cooperate to complete the measurement tasks. The goal is to find a minimal number of viewpoints that provides full coverage of the target surfaces. Although many studies have addressed this problem, there is little discussion about strategies to improve coverage rate when the target object has complex occlusions. This paper suggested a valuable practice to construct a visibility cone space to adjust viewpoint to reduce occlusions and improve the overall coverage rate. Simulation and experimental results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. This paper showed how to deal with various constraints that a feasible viewpoint needs to satisfy in the viewpoint generation, viewpoint adjustment, and viewpoint selection phase. Moreover, this paper provided a solution for developing the visualization, simulation, and interaction of a digital twin for the 7-DOF robotic measurement system. All core services for robotic measurement tasks are implemented based on a set of open source libraries, which provides a convenient learning and research software platform for practitioners. In future research, we will study how to improve the intelligence and cooperation of the robotic measurement system through deep learning or reinforcement learning techniques."
10.1109/TASE.2024.3351076,Robot-Assisted Deep Venous Thrombosis Ultrasound Examination Using Virtual Fixture,"Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) is a common vascular disease with blood clots inside deep veins, which may block blood flow or even cause a life-threatening pulmonary embolism. A typical exam for DVT using ultrasound (US) imaging is by pressing the target vein until its lumen is fully compressed. However, the compression exam is highly operator-dependent. To alleviate intra- and inter-variations, we present a robotic US system with a novel hybrid force motion control scheme ensuring position and force tracking accuracy, and soft landing of the probe onto the target surface. In addition, a path-based virtual fixture is proposed to realize easy human-robot interaction for repeat compression operation at the lesion location. To ensure the biometric measurements obtained in different examinations are comparable, the 6D scanning path is determined in a coarse-to-fine manner using both an external RGBD camera and US images. The RGBD camera is first used to extract a rough scanning path on the object. Then, the segmented vascular lumen from US images are used to optimize the scanning path to ensure the visibility of the target object. To generate a continuous scan path for developing virtual fixtures, an arc-length based path fitting model considering both position and orientation is proposed. Finally, the whole system is evaluated on a human-like arm phantom with an uneven surface. The code (https://github.com/dianyeHuang/RobDVTUS) and intuitive demonstration video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xFyqU1rV8c) can be publicly accessed. Note to Practitioners—Robotic ultrasound (US) systems have attracted attention for various applications in the past decades. However, the existing studies are not mature and intelligent enough for some challenging applications, such as DVT exam, which requires rich contact interaction between patients and clinicians. To tackle with this challenge, this study presents a novel human-centric robotic DVT exam program using the technique of virtual fixture. The coarse-to-fine path planning module ensures the repeatability of US acquisitions carried out at different times. During DVT exam, the proposed continuous 6D path virtual fixture can guide clinicians to freely move the probe along the scan path while limiting the probe motion in other directions. In order to perform the compress-release exam, a decoupled position/force controller is developed to precisely generate the contact force conveyed by clinicians and to restrict the probe motion along the probe centerline. We believe such a robot-assisted system is a promising solution to take both advantages of robots about the accuracy and repeatability and human operators about the advanced physiological knowledge."
10.1109/TASE.2024.3385412,"Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Persistent Monitoring With Sensing, Communication, and Localization Constraints","Determining multi-robot motion policies for persistently monitoring a region with limited sensing, communication, and localization constraints in non-GPS environments is a challenging problem. To take the localization constraints into account, in this paper, we consider a heterogeneous robotic system consisting of two types of agents: anchor agents with accurate localization capability and auxiliary agents with low localization accuracy. To localize itself, the auxiliary agents must be within the communication range of an anchor, directly or indirectly. The robotic team’s objective is to minimize environmental uncertainty through persistent monitoring. We propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) based architecture with graph convolution called Graph Localized Proximal Policy Optimization (GALOPP), which incorporates the limited sensor field-of-view, communication, and localization constraints of the agents along with persistent monitoring objectives to determine motion policies for each agent. We evaluate the performance of GALOPP on open maps with obstacles having a different number of anchor and auxiliary agents. We further study 1) the effect of communication range, obstacle density, and sensing range on the performance and 2) compare the performance of GALOPP with area partition, greedy search, random search, and random search with communication constraint strategies. For its generalization capability, we also evaluated GALOPP in two different environments– 2-room and 4-room. The results show that GALOPP learns the policies and monitors the area well. As a proof-of-concept, we perform hardware experiments to demonstrate the performance of GALOPP. Note to Practitioners—Persistent monitoring is performed in various applications like search and rescue, border patrol, wildlife monitoring, etc. Typically, these applications are large-scale, and hence using a multi-robot system helps achieve the mission objectives effectively. Often, the robots are subject to limited sensing range and communication range, and they may need to operate in GPS-denied areas. In such scenarios, developing motion planning policies for the robots is difficult. Due to the lack of GPS, alternative localization mechanisms, like SLAM, high-accurate INS, UWB radio, etc. are essential. Having SLAM or a highly accurate INS system is expensive, and hence we use agents having a combination of expensive, accurate localization systems (anchor agents) and low-cost INS systems (auxiliary agents) whose localization can be made accurate using cooperative localization techniques. To determine efficient motion policies, we use a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning technique (GALOPP) that takes the heterogeneity in the vehicle localization capability, limited sensing, and communication constraints into account. GALOPP is evaluated using simulations and compared with baselines like random search, random search with ensured communication, greedy search, and area partitioning. The results show that GALOPP outperforms the baselines. The GALOPP approach offers a generic solution that be adopted with various other applications."
10.1109/TASE.2024.3398214,A Redundant Parallel Continuum Manipulator With Stiffness-Varying and Force-Sensing Capability,"This paper presents the design, analysis, and validation of a novel redundant planar parallel continuum manipulator (PCM) consisting of four flexible links coupled at the rigid mid- and end-platform. To address complex geometry/static hybrid constraints at the rigid platforms, a general framework is developed for the kinetostatics modeling and analysis. Benefiting from the redundant actuation design, the Cartesian stiffness of the studied PCM can be further adjusted as a secondary task to positioning. Utilizing the proposed deflection-based force sensing method, the external load exerted on the end-effector can also be identified by measuring the pose of rigid platforms. To validate the proposed design, a prototype is built, on which a series of experiments have been conducted. The results show that, with the proposed kinetostatics models, the prototype exhibits a mean position and orientation error of 0.52 mm and 0.41°. Finally, the capability of stiffness-varying and force-sensing is demonstrated to verify the feasibility and potential applications of the designed redundant PCM.Note to Practitioners—This paper is motivated by the need for more adaptable robotic systems in industrial and interactive settings. In this work, a novel redundant parallel continuum manipulator with variable passive compliance and force-sensing capability is presented. This planar manipulator comprises four flexible limbs, each driven by independent linear modules, thus the redundancy in the actuation can be leveraged for varying Cartesian stiffness. By means of measuring the pose of the end-effector, the interaction force exerted on the end-effector can be identified according to the force sensing model. The structural compliance of the manipulator enhances safety in human-robot collaboration, while variable stiffness accommodates the specific requirements of different interaction tasks. Furthermore, the force-sensing capability allows for precise feedback control, significantly improving safety during interactions with humans. Therefore, the presented PCM has the potential for interactive manipulation applications, including delicate and fragile object handling, as well as human-robot collaboration in assembly tasks."

The framework uses transition systems to mathematically represent planning tasks and employs multiple solvers to iteratively improve the plan until computational resources are exhausted. When integrating different solvers for iterative planning, we establish theoretical guarantees for recursive feasibility. The proposed framework enables continual improvement of solutions to reduce sub-optimality, efficiently using allocated computational resources. The proposed method is validated by applying it to an energy-aware UAV-UGV cooperative task site assignment problem. The results demonstrate continual solution improvement while preserving real-time implementation ability compared to algorithms proposed in the literature.Note to Practitioners—This paper presents an iterative planning solution for cooperative planning problems in multi-agent systems, which integrates multiple solvers to create an optimization framework. The proposed planning framework has been theoretically validated and applied in an energy-aware cooperative planning scenario for multi-vehicle task site assignments. The proposed framework can be applied to plan for any generalized task site assignment using multiple solvers iteratively."
10.1109/TASE.2024.3401456,Hierarchical Q-Learning Path Planning for Cooperative Tracking Control of Multi-Agent Systems With Lumped Uncertainties,"This paper presents the hierarchical Q-learning path planning (HQPP) architecture for solving the cooperative tracking control problem of multi-agent systems (MASs) with lumped uncertainties in an unknown environment. The presented architecture consists of three layers, namely, the decision layer, the distributed estimated layer, and the local control layer. Specifically, in the decision layer, we propose the dynamic parameter and trajectory fitting Q-learning (DPTF-Q-learning) algorithm to find a feasible continuous trajectory to the target in an unknown environment. In addition, two dynamic parameters are proposed and introduced into the DPTF-Q-learning algorithm to shorten the required minimum number of steps in the training process. Then, the distributed estimated layer is designed to broadcast the continuous trajectory generated from the decision layer based on the directed communication topology containing a spanning tree. In the local control layer, the cooperative tracking control (CTC) algorithm is proposed to achieve cooperative tracking for MASs in the presence of uncertain dynamics and external disturbances. The sufficient conditions for achieving cooperative tracking control are rigorously derived by employing Lyapunov argument. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.Note to Practitioners—This paper is motivated by the need of developing an integrated path planning and control method for cooperative tracking of multi-agent systems in a no-signal environment and without the presence of users. Most related works are limited to separate fields: 1) most existing path planning techniques are only applicable to a single agent and discrete environments, and 2) most existing cooperative tracking algorithms focus on guaranteeing control stability and error convergence without decision-making capabilities. To address the above issues, this work proposes a hierarchical control architecture based on reinforcement learning for multi-agent systems to achieve path planning and cooperative tracking tasks. In addition, multi-agent systems exhibit strong robustness and fault tolerance due to their inherent characteristics, so the above mentioned research can be well applied to post-disaster rescue, intelligent logistics, future war, and so on. Numerical simulations based on Matlab and Python verify the effectiveness of the proposed architecture."
10.1109/TASE.2024.3452149,Toward Cognitive Digital Twin System of Human-Robot Collaboration Manipulation,"Multielement decision-making is crucial for the robust deployment of human-robot collaboration (HRC) systems in flexible manufacturing environments with personalized tasks and dynamic scenes. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities in various robotic tasks, potentially offering this capability. However, the application of LLMs to actual HRC systems requires the timely and comprehensive capturing of real-scene information. In this study, we suggest incorporating real scene data into LLMs using digital twin (DT) technology and present a cognitive digital twin prototype system of HRC manipulation, known as HRC-CogiDT. Specifically, we initially construct a scene semantic graph encoding the geometric information of entities, spatial relations between entities, actions of humans and robots, and collaborative activities. Subsequently, we devise a prompt that merges scene semantics with prior knowledge of activities, linking the real scene with LLMs. To evaluate performance, we compile an HRC scene understanding dataset and set up a laboratory-level experimental platform. Empirical results indicate that HRC-CogiDT can swiftly perceive scene changes and make high-level decisions based on varying task requirements, such as task planning, anomaly detection, and schedule reasoning. This study provides promising insights for the future applications of LLMs in robotics.Note to Practitioners—Recently, LLMs have demonstrated significant success in various robotic tasks, suggesting their potential as a powerful tool for robotic decision-making. Motivated by this, to improve the production efficiency of HRC in flexible manufacturing, we innovatively combine LLMs with DT technology, and propose a cognitive DT system for HRC, aiming to integrate LLMs into the decision-making loop of HRC system. Experiments conducted in a laboratory-scale platform indicate that the proposed system can handle different decision-making needs in different HRC activities. This system can provide professional guidance to operators in a comprehensible form and serve as a medium for monitoring the safety and standardization of the manipulation process. Future work will explore the use of virtual space provided by the proposed system to optimize the decision outputs of LLMs to make the proposed system more broadly applicable."
10.1109/TASE.2024.3487219,Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Swarm Confrontation With High Uncertainty,"In swarm robotics, confrontation including the pursuit-evasion game is a key scenario. High uncertainty caused by unknown opponents’ strategies, dynamic obstacles, and insufficient training complicates the action space into a hybrid decision process. Although the deep reinforcement learning method is significant for swarm confrontation since it can handle various sizes, as an end-to–end implementation, it cannot deal with the hybrid process. Here, we propose a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning approach consisting of a target allocation layer, a path planning layer, and the underlying dynamic interaction mechanism between the two layers, which indicates the quantified uncertainty. It decouples the hybrid process into discrete allocation and continuous planning layers, with a probabilistic ensemble model to quantify the uncertainty and regulate the interaction frequency adaptively. Furthermore, to overcome the unstable training process introduced by the two layers, we design an integration training method including pre-training and cross-training, which enhances the training efficiency and stability. Experiment results in both comparison, ablation, and real-robot studies validate the effectiveness and generalization performance of our proposed approach. In our defined experiments with twenty to forty agents, the win rate of the proposed method reaches around ninety percent, outperforming other traditional methods. Note to Practitioners—With artificial intelligence rapidly developing, robots will play a significant role in the future. Especially, the swarm formed by many robots holds promising potential in civil and military applications. Promoting the swarm into games or battles is rather riveting. The reinforcement learning method provides a plausible solution to realize the battle of robotic swarms. There are still some issues that need to be addressed. On one hand, we focus on the uncertainty caused by the battlefield nature and the environment which limits our ability for the implementation of swarms. On the other hand, we solve the problem that the decision process combined with commands and actions is a hybrid system, which cannot be directly reflected in the confrontation of swarms. Overall, our approaches throw light on artificial general intelligence and also reveal a solution to interpretable intelligence."
10.1109/TASE.2025.3554653,Real-Time Obstacle Detection for a Biped Robot Climbing on Exoskeleton-Structure Glass Windows,"This paper presents a novel real-time obstacle detection method for a biped climbing robot. It is composed of a modified UNet neural network combined with a large-field separable contextual integration (LSCI) module and machine vision techniques for line detection. Such an approach allows the biped robot to accurately detect and locate metal exoskeleton-structure obstacles on glass curtain walls. Moreover, the algorithm adopts point cloud data collected from a depth camera to ensure precise identification of target exoskeleton-structure frames including the positions and tilt angles, facilitating effective real-time collision-free motion planning for the cleaning robot system. Comparative experiments with other neural networks used for image segmentation demonstrate that the proposed LSCI-UNet architecture significantly improves the frame obstacle detection accuracy on exoskeleton-structure glass windows with limited data. The reported method enables the biped cleaning robots to detect obstacles in real-time and effectively navigate on glass walls with exoskeleton-structure beams. Note to Practitioners—Cleaning glass windows of high-altitude buildings imposes significant risks to human workers due to potential falls, which inspires the deployment of window-cleaning robots for such tasks. Bipedal robots exhibit an ability to navigate inclined surfaces of complex exoskeleton structures. Meanwhile, accurate detection and positioning of metal beam obstacles on the windows is crucial for efficient robotic operations in complex environments. However, detecting such obstacles on transparent glass curtain walls remains a considerable challenge. Particularly, the objects behind the glass curtain cause confusion in obstacle detection. To overcome such issue, this paper proposes a new approach of real-time obstacle detection of a biped climbing robot for cleaning glass windows on an exoskeleton-structure building. The effectiveness of the reported methodology has been validated by conducting experimental investigations."
10.1109/TASE.2025.3564644,Trajectory-Attracted Adaptive Tracking Control for Robotic Systems Based on a Hybrid Guiding Vector Field in Flexible Environments,"This paper proposes a trajectory-attracted adaptive tracking control (TAATC) scheme based on a hybrid guiding vector field (HGVF) for robotic systems, addressing the high operational difficulty and safety concerns inherent in flexible environments. The HGVF is constructed using the characteristics of different task spaces in flexible environments to enable smooth transitions between free space and contact space with adjustable operating velocity, thereby enhancing robustness against environmental interactions and uncertainties. The HGVF can attract the state trajectories of the robotic systems by path convergence of an auxiliary dynamic system, simplifying the trajectory planning process with a time-independent representation of the desired path. In addition, a neural network is employed to compensate for uncertainties in the robotic systems, while a nonlinear duffing function represents the dynamic contact force model of flexible environments. In this way, the TAATC scheme is constructed by using the HGVF and the adaptive neural network, which unifies trajectory planning and tracking control. By using the proposed TAATC scheme, the robotic systems can achieve smooth interaction with flexible environments and obtain the desired tracking force without complex trajectory planning. The stability of the HGVF and the whole control scheme are analyzed by using the Lyapunov theorem. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through both simulation and experimental tests. Note to Practitioners—The motivation of this article is that operational tasks in flexible environments are the most common for robotic systems, where the deformation and fragile nature exist widely in actual applications. The risks of overshooting, oscillations, and other harmful effects during the task execution, especially when transitioning from non-contact to contact tasks, usually degrade the control performances or even damage the flexible objects. In this article, a HGVF-based trajectory-attracted adaptive tracking control scheme is proposed for robotic systems with uncertainty operating in flexible environments. The theoretical derivation demonstrates that the proposed control scheme can attract the robotic system to track a desired trajectory and interaction with flexible environments safely, where the smooth transitioning process is achieved by using the HVGF-based time-independent control method to unify the trajectory planning and tracking control. The satisfactory control performances of the simulation and experimental tests on a robotic manipulator, which interacts with a flexible object, show the practical application on a real robotic system."
10.1109/TASE.2025.3566461,Learning 6-DoF Fine-Grained Grasp Detection Based on Part Affordance Grounding,"Robotic grasping is a fundamental ability for a robot to interact with the environment. Current methods focus on how to obtain a stable and reliable grasping pose in object level, while little work has been studied on part (shape)-wise grasping which is related to fine-grained grasping and robotic affordance. Parts can be seen as atomic elements to compose an object, which contains rich semantic knowledge and a strong correlation with affordance. However, lacking a large part-wise 3D robotic dataset limits the development of part representation learning and downstream applications. In this paper, we propose a new large Language-guided SHape grAsPing datasEt (named LangSHAPE) to promote 3D part-level affordance and grasping ability learning. From the perspective of robotic cognition, we design a two-stage fine-grained robotic grasping framework (named LangPartGPD), including a novel 3D part language grounding model and a part-aware grasp pose detection model, in which explicit language input from human or large language models (LLMs) could guide a robot to generate part-level 6-DoF grasping pose with textual explanation. Our method combines the advantages of human-robot collaboration and LLMs’ planning ability using explicit language as a symbolic intermediate. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we perform 3D part grounding and fine-grained grasp detection experiments on both simulation and physical robot settings, following language instructions across different degrees of textual complexity. Results show our method achieves competitive performance in 3D geometry fine-grained grounding, object affordance inference, and 3D part-aware grasping tasks. Our dataset and code are available on our project website https://sites.google.com/view/lang-shape. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the problem of pragmatic 6 DoF robotic grasping for a robot in a real-world scenario. Different from existing work focusing on task-oriented solutions, our research attempts to consider fine-grained grasping as a general and essential modeling problem (i.e. Point 1: which part to grasp; Point 2: how to grasp the specific part). For that, our method fully considers the scalability and compatibility with subsequently developed functional modules. A two-stage loosely-coupled fine-grained grasping framework (LangPartGPD) is designed, including a 3D part language grounding model and a part-aware 6 DoF grasping pose detection model (Point 1). The former is used to link the symbolic-level grasped part representation to the specific region of an object. The latter is to realize kinematic-level grasping point generation based on the constraint of parts (Point 2). To realize the designed model, we propose a newly large-scale language-pointcloud-grasp dataset (LangSHAPE) to train fine-grained 3D part-level grounding and part-constrained grasping detection models. It is noted that our method is purely concerned with the target object, grasped part, and functionality to realize to model the essential fine-grained graspability, which is an insufficiently explored direction currently and could promote task-level grasping performance. The symbolic-level description of grasping in the form of natural language provides an explainable decision and a user-friendly interface for human-robot collaboration. Experiments in simulations and real-robot settings show our method can effectively enable a robot to make a cognitive decision for fine-grained manipulation. Summarily, our work is a preliminary exploration to link symbolic-level cognitive space to kinematic-level control space directly. In future research, we will further combine more complicated cognitive knowledge from public multimodal knowledge graphs and multimodal LLMs, to build a general robotic cognitive decision system using LangPartGPD as the basic components."
10.1109/TASE.2025.3568141,HCNV: Hand-Eye Calibration Based on Surface Normal Optimization and View Selection,"Accurate hand-eye calibration is crucial for robotics and computer vision tasks, such as robotic manipulation and 3D object recognition, as it directly affects operational precision and visual perception. However, existing methods rely solely on point clouds and neglect geometric features like plane normals, leading to suboptimal spatial alignment. Additionally, the lack of an intelligent view selection strategy worsens initial alignment errors, causing cumulative inaccuracies and degraded performance. We propose HCNV, a novel framework that combines optimized point cloud alignment with intelligent view selection to overcome these limitations. Our method uses plane normals and a hybrid genetic algorithm to refine the point cloud transformation matrix, significantly improving spatial alignment accuracy. Furthermore, the intelligent view selection strategy enhances point cloud matching and optimizes view coverage, increasing robustness across various conditions. Experimental results show that HCNV improves calibration accuracy by 20% and reduces computational time by 30% compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality in real-world applications. Note to Practitioners—This paper addresses the robotic hand-eye calibration problem, essential for accurate sensor alignment. Existing methods face two main challenges: 1) the lack of geometric model information, leading to insufficient constraints during point cloud alignment and resulting in cumulative errors, and 2) the absence of a mechanism to filter out views with significant point cloud errors during calibration. To address these issues, we propose a novel hand-eye calibration framework, HCNV, which optimizes point cloud alignment by fitting point clouds to planes, improving relative pose estimation accuracy. Additionally, the framework incorporates an error-based view selection strategy to reduce the impact of reprojection errors during calibration. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques on both synthetic and real-world datasets."
10.1109/TASE.2025.3582945,Model and Collision Avoidance for Motion Planning of Rigid-Soft Robot With Continuous Expression and Input Mapping,"This paper presents a motion planning approach for rigid-soft hybrid robots that incorporates continuous expression and input mapping, aiming to achieve both tracking and collision avoidance. The conventional piecewise constant curvature model utilized in soft robots suffers from issues of discontinuity and singularity. These inherent drawbacks pose significant challenges when attempting to address the nonlinear problems associated with motion planning. To overcome these limitations, we establish a relationship between the length of drive cable and the coordination of robot terminal. Through the application of Taylor transformation, we effectively eliminate the control variation present in the denominator of this expression. Then, the nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) with this model expression and input mapping is proposed for motion planning. By directly constructing the current input and output of the motion planning based on the combination of previous data and substituting the linearized part of the model with this data, we mitigate the impact of model inaccuracies on the solution process. Both the obstacles and robot are modeled as polyhedra, and the collision problem is reformulated in the form of continuous nonlinear inequalities. These expressions are then incorporated into the NMPC optimization function as collision avoidance constraints. This approach enables the attainment of a larger feasible movement area and more precise tracking results during the motion planning process. Finally, experimental and simulation results conducted on a rigid-soft hybrid robot demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method, validating its effectiveness in practical applications. Note to Practitioners—This paper was developed for the motion planning of rigid-soft robots in tracking and collision-avoidance tasks. In industrial robotic arms used in manufacturing processes, it can enhance motion planning to ensure seamless part handling while avoiding collisions with surrounding equipment. For example, in automotive assembly lines, these robots need to precisely pick and place components without hitting fixtures or other robots. In service robots for indoor environments, like those used in hospitals for patient care or in warehouses for inventory management, the proposed method can be used to plan paths that avoid obstacles such as furniture, people, or stacked goods. The ability to convert collision-avoidance constraints into nonlinear continuous inequalities, treating the robot and obstacles as polyhedra, provides a larger motion range, which is crucial in these complex indoor settings.In future work, we aim to improve the algorithm efficiency and real-time performance, which will further expand the applicability of this approach in time-critical robotic applications."

However, high-quality image acquisition heavily relies on experienced sonographers, which restricts its further popularization. In this paper, a robotic system designed for automated spinal ultrasound scanning is proposed. Drawing inspiration from the spinal anatomy and the actions of seasoned sonographers, the system integrates both a deep learning agent and a reinforcement learning agent to collaboratively guide the adjustment of the ultrasound probe in external-vision-independent environments, relying on real-time ultrasound images and contact force. Then, a hybrid force-to-velocity control framework is proposed to ensure proper ultrasound coupling during the scanning process. Experimental results on a phantom and human participants demonstrated that this system can accurately track spinal features (mean error: less than 1 mm) and maintain normal probe orientation (out-of-plane angular error:  $1.61~\pm ~1.1^{\circ }$ , in-plane angular error:  $1.27~\pm ~0.9^{\circ }$ ), resulting in high-quality and reproducible ultrasound images. Overall, our system shows great potential for clinical applications. Note to Practitioners—This paper is motivated by the increasing needs of human-robot interaction in medical applications, with a specific emphasis on robotic ultrasound imaging. Clinical sonographers suffer from repetitive workload during the diagnostic process, highlighting the significance of automated scanning solutions. In this work, we propose a modular control framework for ultrasound probe positioning that supports a multi-modal autonomous ultrasound scanning system. The system operates independently of external optics or prior geometric knowledge of the scanning object. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the system can effectively cover the region of interest of the spine, facilitating high-quality ultrasound image acquisition and related disease assessment. This advancement is expected to enhance the efficiency of human-robot interaction in healthcare settings and holds promising clinical applications. Furthermore, our research offers valuable insights for the implementation of robotic ultrasound scanning systems applicable to other human tissues."
10.1109/TCAD.2020.3012648,Exploring Edge Computing for Multitier Industrial Control,"Industrial automation traditionally relies on local controllers implemented on microcontrollers or programmable logic controllers. With the emergence of edge computing, however, industrial automation evolves into a distributed two-tier computing architecture comprising local controllers and edge servers that communicate over wireless networks. Compared to local controllers, edge servers provide larger computing capacity at the cost of data loss over wireless networks. This article presents switching multitier control (SMC) to exploit edge computing for industrial control. SMC dynamically optimizes control performance by switching between local and edge controllers in response to changing network conditions. SMC employs a data-driven approach to derive switching policies based on classification models trained based on simulations while guaranteeing system stability based on an extended Simplex approach tailored for two-tier platforms. To evaluate the performance of industrial control over edge computing platforms, we have developed WCPS-EC, a real-time hybrid simulator that integrates simulated plants, real computing platforms, and real or simulated wireless networks. In a case study of an industrial robotic control system, SMC significantly outperformed both a local controller and an edge controller in face of varying data loss in a wireless network."
10.1109/TCAD.2023.3246386,Ulgen: A Runtime Assurance Framework for Programming Safe Cyber–Physical Systems,"We present Ulgen, a runtime assurance (RTA) framework for programming safe cyber–physical systems (CPSs). In Ulgen, a system is implemented as a collection of asynchronous processes executing RTA modules which are generalizations of the well-known Simplex architecture. An RTA module is composed of a set of safe controllers (SCs), designed to guarantee certain safety specifications, and a set of advanced controllers (ACs), optimized for performance, each defined to run under the specific conditions of the operating environment, and a decision module implementing the switching logic between the controllers. A source of complexity in achieving safe CPS is that these systems often involve concurrently interacting components with different execution semantics. To this end, Ulgen allows for the definition of RTA modules with either event-driven or time-driven execution semantics and encapsulates such components into RTA modules. It further provides primitives for implementing priority-based communication between asynchronous processes, which is a necessary feature for task prioritization mechanisms, such as contingency plans and interrupt service routines. The framework also provides formal guarantees on the safe execution of RTA modules based on a formal definition of well-formedness. In Ulgen, a well-formed RTA module combines SCs and ACs in a way that guarantees the underlying safety specifications assured by the SCs while delivering the desired performance offered by the ACs. We compare the safety guarantees of Ulgen against other state-of-the-art RTA frameworks and demonstrate its efficacy in implementing safe and performant CPS by presenting an extensive experimental evaluation of five case studies both in a simulation environment and on a real robotic platform."

Here, an active vision- based pipeline is presented which aims to contribute to reducing the bottleneck associated with phenotyping of architectural traits. The pipeline provides a fully automated response to photometric data acquisition and the recovery of three-dimensional (3D) models of plants without the dependency of botanical expertise, whilst ensuring a non-intrusive and non-destructive approach. Access to complete and accurate 3D models of plants supports computation of a wide variety of structural measurements. An Active Vision Cell (AVC) consisting of a camera-mounted robot arm plus combined software interface and a novel surface reconstruction algorithm is proposed. This pipeline provides a robust, flexible, and accurate method for automating the 3D reconstruction of plants. The reconstruction algorithm can reduce noise and provides a promising and extendable framework for high throughput phenotyping, improving current state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the pipeline can be applied to any plant species or form due to the application of an active vision framework combined with the automatic selection of key parameters for surface reconstruction."

This paper presents AutoHMA-LLM, a novel framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with classical control algorithms to address the challenges of task coordination and scheduling in complex, dynamic environments. The framework is designed with a multi-tier architecture, utilizing a cloud-based LLM as the central planner alongside device-specific LLMs and Generative Agents to improve task execution efficiency and accuracy. Specifically targeting dynamic scenarios, the system enhances resource utilization and stabilizes task execution through refined task scheduling and real-time feedback mechanisms. In experiments conducted across logistics, inspection, and search & rescue scenarios, AutoHMA-LLM demonstrated a 5.7% improvement in task completion accuracy, a 46% reduction in communication steps, and a 31% decrease in token usage and API calls compared to baseline methods. These results highlight our framework’s scalability and efficiency, offering substantial support for effective multi-agent collaboration in complex, resource-constrained environments."
10.1109/TCDS.2019.2925890,Autonomous Identification and Goal-Directed Invocation of Event-Predictive Behavioral Primitives,"Voluntary behavior of humans appears to be composed of small, elementary building blocks, or behavioral primitives. While this modular organization seems crucial for the learning of complex motor skills and the flexible adaption of behavior to new circumstances, the problem of learning meaningful, compositional abstractions from sensorimotor experiences remains an open challenge. Here, we introduce a computational learning architecture, termed as surprise-based behavioral modularization into event-predictive structures (SUBMODES) that explores behavior and identifies the underlying behavioral units completely from scratch. The SUBMODES architecture bootstraps sensorimotor exploration using a self-organizing neural controller. While exploring the behavioral capabilities of its own body, the system learns modular structures that predict the sensorimotor dynamics and generate the associated behavior. In line with recent theories of event perception, the system uses unexpected prediction error signals, i.e., surprise, to detect transitions between successive behavioral primitives. We show that, when applied to two robotic systems with completely different body kinematics, the system manages to learn a variety of complex behavioral primitives. Moreover, after initial self exploration the system can use its learned predictive models progressively more effectively for invoking model predictive planning and goal-directed control in different tasks and environments."
10.1109/TCDS.2021.3059045,"Time Perception: A Review on Psychological, Computational, and Robotic Models","Animals exploit time to survive in the world. Temporal information is required for higher level cognitive abilities, such as planning, decision making, communication, and effective cooperation. Since time is an inseparable part of cognition, there is a growing interest in the artificial intelligence approach to subjective time, which has a possibility of advancing the field. The current survey study aims to provide researchers with an interdisciplinary perspective on time perception. First, we introduce a brief background from the psychology and neuroscience literature, covering the characteristics and models of time perception and related abilities. Second, we summarize the emergent computational and robotic models of time perception. A general overview to the literature reveals that a substantial amount of timing models are based on a dedicated time processing like the emergence of a clock-like mechanism from the neural network dynamics and reveals a relationship between the embodiment and time perception. We also notice that most models of timing are developed for either sensory timing (i.e., ability to assess an interval) or motor timing (i.e., ability to reproduce an interval). The number of timing models capable of retrospective timing, which is the ability to track time without paying attention, is insufficient. In this light, we discuss the possible research directions to promote the interdisciplinary collaboration in the field of time perception."
10.1109/TCDS.2022.3145915,Collision-Free Navigation in Human-Following Task Using a Cognitive Robotic System on Differential Drive Vehicles,"As human–robot collaboration increases tremendously in real-world applications, a fully autonomous and reliable mobile robot for the collaboration has been a central research topic and investigated extensively in a large number of studies. One of the most pressing issues in such topic is the collision-free navigation that has a moving goal and unknown obstacles under the unstructured environment. In this article, a cognitive robotic system (CRS) is proposed for the robot to navigate itself to the moving target person without obstacle collision. This CRS consists of a cognitive agent, which is created based on the Soar cognitive architecture to reason its current situation and make action decision for the robot to avoid obstacles and reach the target position, and a speed planning module, which is based on dynamic window approach (DWA) to generate appropriate linear and angular velocities for driving the robot’s motors. For the implementation of the proposed system, we use a differential drive wheel robot equipped with two ultrawideband (UWB) sensors and a color depth camera as the experimental platform. Finally, to evaluate the performance of our system in actual operating conditions, we conduct experiments with a scenario that includes main tasks: avoiding consecutive unknown obstacles and turning at corner while the robot follows continuously human user along the corridor."
10.1109/TCDS.2022.3152383,Learning Deep Features for Robotic Inference From Physical Interactions,"In order to effectively handle multiple tasks that are not predefined, a robotic agent needs to automatically map its high-dimensional sensory inputs into useful features. As a solution, feature learning has empirically shown substantial improvements in obtaining representations that are generalizable to different tasks, compared to feature engineering approaches, but it requires a large amount of data and computational capacity. These challenges are specifically relevant in robotics due to the low signal-to-noise ratios inherent to robotic data, and to the cost typically associated with collecting this type of input. In this article, we propose a deep probabilistic method based on convolutional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) to learn visual features suitable for interaction and recognition tasks. We run our experiments on a self-supervised robotic sensorimotor data set. Our data were acquired with the iCub humanoid and are based on a standard object collection, thus being readily extensible. We evaluated the learned features in terms of usability for: 1) object recognition; 2) capturing the statistics of the effects; and 3) planning. In addition, where applicable, we compared the performance of the proposed architecture with other state-of-the-art models. These experiments demonstrate that our model is capable of capturing the functional statistics of action and perception (i.e., images) which performs better than existing baselines, without requiring millions of samples or any hand-engineered features."

To grasp a payload without human interaction, most state-of-the-art approaches apply robotic arms that are attached to the quadcopter body. However, due to the large weight and power consumption of these aerial manipulators, their agility and flight time are limited. This article proposes a motion control and planning method for transportation with a lightweight, passive manipulator structure that consists of a hook attached to a quadrotor using a 1-DoF revolute joint. To perform payload grasping, transportation, and release, first, time-optimal reference trajectories are designed through specific waypoints to ensure the fast and reliable execution of the tasks. Then, a two-stage motion control approach is developed based on a robust geometric controller for precise and reliable reference tracking and a linear-quadratic payload regulator for rapid setpoint stabilization of the payload swing. Furthermore, mathematical guarantees are provided for closed-loop stability to ensure safe operation. The proposed control architecture and design are evaluated in a high-fidelity physical simulator and also in real flight experiments, using a custom-made quadrotor-hook manipulator platform."

Most studies explore data-driven pattern recognition techniques that are generally highly dependent on learning data and insufficiently effective for emotion contextual recognition. In this article, a hybrid model-based emotion contextual recognition approach for cognitive assistance services in ubiquitous environments is proposed. This model is based on: 1) a hybrid-level fusion exploiting a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural-network model and the possibilistic logic and 2) an expressive emotional knowledge representation and reasoning model to recognize nondirectly observable emotions; this model exploits jointly the emotion upper ontology (EmUO) and the n-ary ontology of events HTemp supported by the NKRL language. For validation purposes of the proposed approach, experiments were carried out using a YouTube dataset, and in a real-world scenario dedicated to the cognitive assistance of visitors in a smart devices showroom. Results demonstrated that the proposed multimodal emotion recognition model outperforms all baseline models. The real-world scenario corroborates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of emotion contextual recognition and management and in the creation of emotion-based assistance services. © 2013 IEEE."

When the environments are unknown, prior motion planning for navigation may not always be available. This article presents a novel Sim-to-Real method to guide a cable-driven soft robot in a static environment under the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA). The scenario aims to resemble one of the steps during a simplified transoral tracheal intubation process where a robotic endotracheal tube is guided to the upper trachea–larynx location by a flexible video-assisted endoscope/stylet. In SOFA, we employ the quadratic programming inverse solver to obtain collision-free motion strategies for the endoscope/stylet manipulation based on the robot model and encode the virtual eye-in-hand vision.

For the above problem, in this article, a new circular peg-in-hole assembly control strategy is proposed for the 6-Degree of Freedom (DOF) robot based on hybrid visual measurements, avoiding peg-in-hole contacts during the robotic operation. In the strategy, the pose of the monocular camera mounted at the end-effector is adaptively adjusted to improve the image quality through an algorithm based on the rough pose measurement of the target hole by the binocular camera; the accurate 3-D pose of the hole is determined by an algorithm based on processing of high-quality images and the compensation of the orientation error.

This article presents a fast real-time instance segmentation network (FRISNET) by fusing the information from the frequency domain and space domain. Based on you only look at coefficients (YOLACT), which is the fastest instance segmentation method, the frequency domain representation is introduced into a convolutional neural network (CNN). By fast Fourier transform (FFT), features of different frequencies extracted from the frequency domain are fused with the characteristic map of the spatial domain. Accurate global location information and clear semantic information are obtained using CNN.

It is a non-trivial task to detect the source of diffusion pollution, such that the disadvantageous effect of the pollution can be reduced. With the vision of 6G framework, we employ Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) flock and introduce the concept of AUV-based network. In particular, we utilize the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technique to update the controllability of the AUV-based network, leading to the paradigm of SDN-enabled multi-AUVs network Intelligent Transportation Systems (SDNA-ITS).

In particular, we improve the optimization model based on Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) architecture with the assistance of the SDN controller, by which each AUV can efficiently adjust its speed towards the diffusion source. Further, to achieve exact path planning for detecting the diffusion source, a dynamic detection scheme is proposed to output the united control policy to schedule the SDNA-ITS dynamically.

In this paper, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Hierarchical Optimal Scheduling Algorithm (MARLHOSA) is proposed to solve the hierarchical scheduling problem of logistics transport vehicles. We model the hierarchical scheduling problem of logistics transport vehicles as an infinite Markov decision process and set constraints to simulate the actual operating environment. To solve the Markov decision process corresponding to the economic scheduling problem of logistics transport vehicles, this paper uses the close-range strategy optimization algorithm, and uses multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm based on the clipping mechanism to improve the loss function of the short-range strategy optimization algorithm.

However, moving obstacles with unpredictability in dynamic scenarios, usually increase the difficulty and complexity in collision avoidance of robotic vehicles. To enhance the stability of collision avoidance and boost its adaptability to uncertain dynamic scenes, a new attention-based value classification actor-critic (AVCAC) architecture is proposed. It is an end-to-end robot navigation model that utilizes imperfect local observation to directly plan accurate collision-free motion commands. First, we design a value-classified rollout replaybuffer to categorize the experiences into different pools. It can prevent any overfitting or bias that may result from repeatedly sampling experiences of a certain type during policy learning. Then, we improve the conventional actor-critic network with a multi-head local attention module to extract the local observations at entity-level. This way, the collision avoidance system can focus on key environmental features to operate more efficiently and respond more swiftly to dynamic changes in the environment. Moreover, a lookahead multi-step prediction (LMP) reward setting is devised in the AVCAC-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework to facilitate more informed and forward-looking decision-making. Finally, the policy entropy (PE) and policy delay (PD) are extended to AVCAC model to enhance policy exploration and make policy more robust.

Traditional optimizations like genetic algorithms struggle with computational complexity and dynamic planning. Meanwhile, pure multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)—a type of machine learning where multiple agents learn to optimize their decisions through interactions with each other and the environment—faces the curse of dimensionality and communication overhead, which limits the large-scale deployment of dynamic vehicular networks. This paper proposes an innovative approach to joint spectrum allocation and power control within dense V2X networks, conceptualizing it as an MARL-based multi-objective optimization problem. To mitigate computational demands, we adopt a hybrid approach combining centralized-training-with-decentralized-execution paradigm, alongside parameter-sharing techniques, within classic Mean-Field MARL (MF-MARL) framework, and name it Scalable-V2X-MF-MARL (ScalV-MF-MARL), enabling a lightweight training process in dense V2X networks with numerous V2V agents. It also technically encodes observations and mean field of actions, thereby enhancing the model's dynamism and scalability. This advancement permits the application of a single model across varying vehicle densities. Experimental results demonstrate that ScalV-MF-MARL achieves 99.5% of the performance of density-specific MF-MARL models, while reducing GPU memory usage by 79.49% to 94.03% during training as vehicle number increases from 40 to 160. Additionally, it outstrips conventional algorithms. Its generalization capabilities across diverse V2X network densities facilitate training in less dense scenarios, with seamless application to denser networks. In conclusion, ScalV-MF-MARL streamlines the V2X network deployment and effectively handles dynamic changes in vehicle numbers."
10.1109/TIV.2024.3488793,KoMA: Knowledge-Driven Multi-Agent Framework for Autonomous Driving With Large Language Models,"Large language models (LLMs) as autonomous agents offer a novel avenue for tackling real-world challenges through a knowledge-driven manner. These LLM-enhanced methodologies excel in generalization and interpretability. However, the complexity of driving tasks often necessitates the collaboration of multiple, heterogeneous agents, underscoring the need for such LLM-driven agents to engage in cooperative knowledge sharing and cognitive synergy. Despite the promise of LLMs, current applications predominantly center around single-agent scenarios. To broaden the horizons of knowledge-driven strategies and bolster the generalization capabilities of autonomous agents, we propose the KoMA framework consisting of multi-agent interaction, multi-step planning, shared-memory, and ranking-based reflection modules to enhance multi-agents' decision-making in complex driving scenarios. Based on the framework's generated text descriptions of driving scenarios, the multi-agent interaction module enables LLM agents to analyze and infer the intentions of surrounding vehicles based on scene information, akin to human cognition. The multi-step planning module enables LLM agents to analyze and obtain final action decisions layer by layer to ensure consistent goals for short-term action decisions. The shared memory module can accumulate collective experience to make superior decisions, and the ranking-based reflection module can evaluate and improve agent behavior with the aim of enhancing driving safety and efficiency. The KoMA framework not only enhances the robustness and adaptability of autonomous driving agents but also significantly elevates their generalization capabilities across diverse scenarios. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over traditional methods, particularly in its ability to handle complex, unpredictable driving environments without extensive retraining."

However, rendering these virtual environments is resource-intensive. With many users accessing simultaneously and requiring diverse Metaverse services, optimizing Metaverse resources to deliver the best quality-of-experience (QoE) for users is a significant challenge.

Specifically, we first introduce a cooperative VR scene pre-rendering framework between users and Planets (i.e., edge servers hosting users), and establish a new user QoE metric named EdgeVRQoE which considers both rendering delay and visual quality. We formulate the multidimensional rendering resources (e.g., GPU, CPU, and outbound bandwidth) leasing problem between Planets and users as a double-layer decision problem, and devise a hybrid action multi-agent reinforcement learning-based dynamic resource auction mechanism to efficiently allocate limited resources of Planets in a distributed and adaptive manner. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms the representatives in user QoE and resource utilization efficiency. Particularly, the proposed scheme shows at least an 18-fold improvement in QoE over other schemes, demonstrating its capability in providing immersive Metaverse experiences."

Moreover, the autonomous robotic system takes physical and operational constraints into account to perform the demands of a specific visual servoing task in a way to minimize a cost function. A hierarchical control architecture is developed based on interwoven integration of a variant of the iterative closest point image registration, a constrained noise-adaptive Kalman filter, a fault detection logic and recovery system, together with a constrained optimal path planner. The dynamic estimator estimates unknown states and uncertain parameters required for motion prediction while imposing a set of inequality constraints for consistency of the estimation process and adjusting adaptively the Kalman filter parameters in the face of unexpected vision errors. It is followed by the implementation of a fault recovery strategy based on a fault detection logic that monitors the health of the visual feedback using the metric fit error of the image registration. Subsequently, the estimated/predicted pose and parameters are passed to an optimal path planner in order to bring the robot end-effector to the grasping point of a moving target as quickly as possible subject to multiple constraints, such as acceleration limit, smooth capture, and line-of-sight angle of the target. Experimental results demonstrated such a visual servoing system succeeded to capture a free-floating object despite the complete failure of the vision system due to occlusion in the last 10 s prior to approach and capture operation."
10.1109/TMECH.2022.3147767,"Design, Assessment, and Trajectory Control of a Novel Decoupled Robotic Nanomanipulator","To avoid the problems of low bandwidth or complex structure brought by conventional serial and parallel mechanisms, a novel decoupled robotic nanomanipulator (DRNM) with a hybrid configuration is conceived in this article to enable fast nanoscale manipulation. The proposed DRNM employs a new hybrid compliant structure to actuate the terminal platform and decouple the x- and y-axial motions. The unique hybrid mechanism is devised using two H-shaped parallelogram flexures that are assembled in a serial manner and actuated in a parallel manner, bringing in the merits of a flexible terminal platform, compact structure, good decoupling, and wide bandwidth in working directions. To enhance the dynamic positioning performance of the proposed DRNM, a run-to-run-position-forward-based integral controller that can handle the hysteresis nonlinearity of the piezoelectric actuator with adaptive zero-point parameter is further designed. The DRNM prototype is tested having an in-plane resonant frequency of 2005 Hz and a cross coupling of 0.88%. While tracking a circular trajectory with a diameter of 3 µm at a frequency of 20 Hz, the DRNM exhibits a maximum filtered tracking error of 4.3 nm."
10.1109/TMECH.2022.3155614,Robotic Navigation Based on Experiences and Predictive Map Inspired by Spatial Cognition,"Humans and animals have environmental cognition and navigation abilities. These abilities are closely related to the spatial cognitive mechanism of brain. Based on this mechanism, we propose a novel robotic navigation framework based on experiences and predictive map inspired by spatial cognition to accurately construct environment experience and quickly plan path. The grid cell and the place cell are modeled to rapidly integrate self-motion cues. The multidimensional grid coding and one-shot learning rule are utilized for activating the place representation of robot pose. Visual cues provide information for relocation. These information are integrated through experiences which express the topology of the environment, enabling the robot to accurately achieve spatial cognition of complex environment. In order to realize the sequential decision making of hippocampus, the predictive map is introduced to quickly plan the experience sequence to target in dynamic environment. The successor representation model of robot's state is constructed through reinforcement learning. Combined with the goal-based reward function, the shortest path can be replanned to adapt to environment changes. The proposed method is tested in simulated maze, Kitti dataset and corridor environment. Compared with other bionic navigation methods, it has a faster computing speed and higher precision with bionic characteristics. Compared with visual navigation methods, the navigation tasks can robustly be accomplished without complex system design."
10.1109/TMECH.2022.3160605,Trajectory Generation for Multiprocess Robotic Tasks Based on Nested Dual-Memory Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient,"Though there are extensive works on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for robotics, sequential trajectory generation for multiprocess robotic tasks based on DRL is yet to be explored. In this article, the multiprocess task is formulated as a Markov decision process, and a nested dual-memory deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm with dynamic criteria is proposed, to generalize the traditional trajectory planning with predefined target point into a trajectory exploration problem aiming at a target area without solving inverse kinematics. First, a dual-memory architecture with local-to-global strategy is introduced to enhance the performance. Second, a novel nested architecture is proposed to generate sequential trajectory segments successively and asynchronously for the multiprocess task. Third, a compound reward system is designed and a weight coefficient matrix is adopted to balance the position control and the orientation control based on Tait–Bryan angles. In addition, a virtual twin system is established to promote the training efficiency, where the trajectory generated in simulation can be directly applied to the real physical platform. Finally, experimental results on both simulated and real-world applications have verified the performance of the proposed approach."
10.1109/TMECH.2022.3165845,Path Planning for Robotic Manipulator in Complex Multi-Obstacle Environment Based on Improved_RRT,"To plan a successful and practically executable path for a manipulator in a complex obstacle environment, the Improved_RRT method is proposed. In this article, we develop the collision detection model between the manipulator and obstacle based on the cylinder and sphere bounding box, and the shortest distance between the link and obstacle at each moment is obtained. Afterward, hybrid constrained sampling is used instead of original random sampling. The distribution of nodes obtained by sampling is close to the passages between obstacles. During the sampling process, the forward search process is accelerated. In the expansion, we propose a novel approach of RRT_Connect in collaboration with the artificial potential field method. Meanwhile, the adaptive gravitational field, dynamic step size, and new node constraint strategy are adopted. In the process of expansion, the algorithm uses the information of the environment and nodes to expand to the target area in a short time, which reduces the excessive exploration and collision area expansion. Considering the low success rate of algorithm planning in complex, multiobstacle and dynamic environments, local minimum processing and a dynamic path planning method are proposed, which generate double trees in the Cartesian and configuration spaces, respectively, for local path replanning. The improved algorithm is more robust to the singular problems of the manipulator, and the path is smoother after pruning optimization. Simulation results show that, compared with other algorithms, the proposed method can effectively plan a safe and optimal obstacle avoidance path with the best comprehensive performance. Experiments on the actual robotic manipulator platform further prove the efficiency of our method."
10.1109/TMECH.2022.3175484,Learning to Cooperate: A Hierarchical Cooperative Dual Robot Arm Approach for Underactuated Pick-and-Placing,"Cooperative multiagent manipulation systems allow to extend on the manipulative limitations of individual agents, increasing the complexity of the manipulation tasks the ensemble can handle. Controlling such a system requires meticulous planning of subsequent subtasks, queried to the individual agents, in order to execute the master task successfully. Real-time (re)planning is essential to ensure the task can still be achieved when subtasks execution suffers from uncertainty or when the master task changes intermittently requiring real-time reconfiguration of the plan. In this article, we develop a supervisory control architecture tailored to the cooperation of two robotic manipulators equipped with standard pick-and-place facilities in the plane. We control the planar position and orientation of an object using two underactuated manipulators so that only the position of the object can be controlled directly. The desired orientation follows from the accumulation of alternating relative angles. A time-invariant policy function is trained using deep reinforcement learning, which can determine a finite sequence of pick-and-place maneuvers to manipulate the object to a desired configuration. Two policy architectures are compared. The first uses the kinematic model to determine the final step, whilst the second policy makes this decision itself. The more information is given to the policy, the easier it trains. In return, it becomes less adaptable and loses some of its generalizability."
10.1109/TMECH.2022.3195985,A Soft-Rigid Hybrid Gripper With Lateral Compliance and Dexterous In-Hand Manipulation,"Soft grippers are receiving growing attention due to their compliance-based interactive safety and dexterity. Hybrid gripper with soft actuators enhanced by rigid constraints is receiving growing attention in soft gripper design. With rigid structural components actuated by soft actuators, they could achieve excellent grasping adaptability and payload while also being easy to model and control with conventional kinematics. However, existing works were mostly focused on achieving superior payload and perception with simple planar workspaces, resulting in far less dexterity compared with conventional grippers. In this work, we took inspiration from the human metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint and proposed a new hybrid gripper design with eight independent muscles. It was shown that adding the MCP complexity was critical in enabling a range of novel features in the hybrid gripper, including in-hand manipulation, lateral passive compliance, as well as new control modes. A prototype gripper was fabricated and tested on our proprietary dual-arm robot platform with vision-guided grasping. With very lightweight pneumatic bellows soft actuators, the gripper could grasp objects over 20 times its weight with lateral compliance. Using the dual-arm platform, highly anthropomorphic dexterous manipulations were demonstrated using two hybrid grippers, from tug of war on a rigid rod to passing a soft towel between two grippers using in-hand manipulation. Matching the novel features and performance specifications of the proposed hybrid gripper, the underlying modeling, actuation, control, and experimental validation details were also presented, offering a promising approach to achieving enhanced dexterity, strength, and compliance in robotic grippers."

For that, we developed a hybrid geometric model to handle large-scale occlusions combining an online vision-based method and an offline reference template. Then, a reference point generator is introduced to automatically plan the reference poses for the predesigned action primitives. Finally, an action planner integrates these components enabling the execution of high-level behaviors and the accomplishment of packing manipulation tasks. To validate the proposed approach, we conducted a detailed experimental study with multiple types and lengths of objects and packing boxes."
10.1109/TMECH.2023.3275854,A Motion Planning Method for Visual Servoing Using Deep Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Robotic Assembly,"Assembly positioning by visual servoing (VS) is a basis for autonomous robotic assembly. In practice, VS control suffers potential stability and convergence problems due to image and physical constraints, e.g., field of view constraints, image local minima, obstacle collisions, and occlusion. Therefore, this article proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning-based hybrid visual servoing (DRL-HVS) controller for motion planning of VS tasks. DRL-HVS controller takes current observed image features and camera pose as inputs, and the core parameters of hybrid VS are dynamically optimized using a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to obtain an optimal motion scheme, considering image/physical constraints and robot motion performance. In addition, an adaptive exploration strategy is proposed to further improve the training efficiency by adaptively tuning the exploration noise parameters. In this way, the offline pretrained DRL-HVS controller in the virtual environment, where the DDPG actor–critic network is continuously optimized, can be quickly deployed to a real robot system for real-time control. Experiments based on an eye-in-hand VS system are conducted with a calibrated HIKVISION RGB camera mounted on the end-effector of a GSK-RB03A1 six degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) robot. Basic VS task experiments show that the proposed controller achieves better performance than the existing methods: the servoing time is 24% smaller than that of the five-dimensional VS method, a 100% success rate with the perturbed ranges of the initial position within 25 mm for translation and 20° for rotation, and a 48% efficiency improvement. Moreover, a planetary gear component assembly process case study, where the robot aims to automatically put the gears on the gear shafts, is conducted to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method in practice."

Although robots are capable of performing automated operations in structured scenarios, robotic polishing systems for workpieces without a surface model still heavily depend on manual operation due to the inability to plan the polishing pose on the workpiece surface, resulting in high cost, low efficiency, and uncontrollable quality. This article presents a hybrid contact/noncontact measurement method for obtaining a local surface model consisting of three parts: first, a method is proposed for modeling a local workpiece surface based on a binary quadratic equation; then, the design and calibration of a hybrid measurement device is proposed for simultaneously obtaining four discrete points on the surface used to construct its model; and finally, a method is proposed for verifying the accuracy of the constructed local surface model by obtaining and tracking the normal direction of the surface. The proposed method is validated through simulation analysis and actual evaluation in various types of experimental scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively obtain the unknown model workpiece surface model and realize the requirement of a robotic polishing process along the normal direction of surface."

10.1109/TMECH.2025.3532211,A Two-Degree-of-Freedom Ankle Exoskeleton With Control of Plantarflexion and Inversion–Eversion,"Balancing during motion involves humans using inversion–eversion control, a task that robotic exoskeletons can help with. In this study, we developed a two-degree-of-freedom robotic ankle exoskeleton that provides active assistance in both inversion–eversion and plantarflexion using a hybrid material design. This exoskeleton is lightweight, weighing 1.2 kg fully assembled, and offers a rapid step response, demonstrated by rise times of 69 ms $\pm$ 8.4e $-$4 for plantarflexion, and 95 ms $\pm$ 5.4e$-$2 for inversion–eversion. The device presents a gain-limited torque control bandwidth of 16 Hz for plantarflexion and 12 Hz for inversion–eversion. It can generate peak torques of 70 N$\cdot$ m for plantarflexion and $\pm$ 14 N $\cdot$ m for inversion–eversion. In trials where two healthy individuals walked using the device, tracking errors were found to be on average 1.5 $\pm$ 1.4 N $\cdot$ m for plantarflexion and 1.0 $\pm$ 0.7 N $\cdot$ m for inversion–eversion. A single subject was also used as a case study to determine the potential effect of inversion assistance on frontal plane balance. The subject was able to decrease the step-width variability during walking by 58.3% when compared to the no exoskeleton condition. These results indicate that this device could serve as an effective tool for developing and testing balance-centric methodologies in controlled human subject studies."
10.1109/TMRB.2020.3030317,Hybrid Force Tracking Impedance Control-Based Autonomous Robotic System for Tooth Brushing Assistance of Disabled People,"Due to the increase of the world ageing population and several forms of disabilities, assistive robots have received a lot of attention lately. Although, different assistive robotic systems have been developed to perform essential tasks around the head, these existing robotic systems are either manually controlled, shared controlled or interactive ones. Although, fully autonomous robotic systems can have the potential of eliminating several limitations of the existing systems, such systems are limited in design due to critical issues of increased complexities and the associated risks. In this article, a hybrid impedance controller-based autonomous assistive robotic system for tooth brushing assistance is developed. A fixed base manipulator with an attached automatic tooth brush and Kinect RGB-D sensor are proposed as a platform to achieve the brushing task. An online face detection, mouth detection, head pose estimation and trajectory planning for the brushing task are achieved. Additionally, online re-planning the trajectories in case of patients’ head pose changes is taken into account. The controller performance is evaluated regarding tracking the generated brushing trajectories and the desired force trajectory by co-simulating the manipulator’s dynamics in ADAMS and SIMULINK. The results demonstrate the capability of the proposed robotic system to achieve tooth brushing autonomously."

Foot-controlled interfaces have proven suitable for controlling robot arms, however, when it is best to use such devices and what limitations they place when controlling a supernumerary robotic limb (SL) in combination with the natural limbs (NLs) is unknown. Here, we report an investigation of three-handed manipulation with a foot interface. We analysed i) what effect the addition of a SL has on the performance of the NLs; and ii) how mechanical and/or cognitive coupling alters user performance. When the subjects moved the three limbs without coupling, only the motion’s completion time was observed to be significantly affected. In contrast with coupling, the incorporation of the foot controlled hand was found to affect the success rate, and planning of the motion, however it did not affect motion characteristics such as smoothness."

Intelligent ankle-foot prostheses have the potential to improve quality of life in people with limb loss, but there are scientific, clinical, and commercial barriers that prevent widespread impact. Further research tools and experiments are needed to expand our understanding of how to design and control intelligent prosthetic limbs. We designed and built a robotic ankle-foot prosthesis with off-board actuation and control to serve as a platform for biomechanical lower limb loss research. Our prosthesis fits inside of a shoe during walking and attaches to standard clinical prosthesis componentry, including carbon fiber prosthetic footplates and pyramid adapters. Our novel mechanical architecture implements a custom torsion spring in parallel with the ankle joint to allow for dorsiflexion and plantarflexion torque control with a single off-board actuator. Benchtop tests show that our prosthesis has peak plantarflexion torques greater than 175 Nm and a torque control bandwidth of 6.1 Hz. Walking experiments with two participants with lower limb loss indicate that the prosthesis can achieve low torque tracking errors and push-off power greater than the biological ankle during walking. This device will enable future experiments on amputee gait biomechanics, human-robot interaction, and prosthesis control."

However, existing surgical robotic systems often lack the necessary output force to overcome soft tissue tension. To address this limitation, we propose a novel surgical robotic system to deliver high output force with required workspace. Our approach includes the design of a 6-DOF parallel mechanism that utilizes the lever principle for force amplification. The distribution laws of its effective workspace and force amplification gain coefficient are investigated. Additionally, a series-parallel hybrid surgical robot system is developed, which demonstrates the amplification effect on the output force through the force amplification mechanism. To ensure smooth operation of the system, a comprehensive surgical operation framework isdevised that encompasses target pose planning, reduction path planning, real-time intraoperative navigation and control. Modeling experiments show promising results, with an average reduction accuracy of 0.31 mm and 0.24° under no load, and 1.03 mm and 0.34° under loads ranging from 0N to 475N. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our proposed force amplification mechanism in achieving substantial output force amplification while alleviating the surgeon’s burden. Moreover, our robotic system demonstrates the capability to achieve precise pelvic fracture reduction, significantly enhancing surgical outcomes."
10.1109/TMRB.2024.3464123,Self-Steering Catheters for Neuroendovascular Interventions,"The size limitations and tortuosity of the neurovasculature currently exceed the capabilities of existing robotic systems. Furthermore, safety considerations require a fail-safe design whereby some passive compliance is used for an added layer of safety and for sensing the lateral load on the steerable portion of the catheter. To address these needs, we propose a novel multi-articulated robotic catheter technology that aims to increase technical precision, reduce procedural time and radiation exposure, and enable the semi-automation of catheters during neuroendovascular procedures. This catheter uses joint-level sensing and fluoroscopic imaging to actively bend in two separate planes. Its design also uses series-elastic actuation for increased safety and active compliance (self-steering). We present the design, kinematic modeling, and calibration of this system. A multi-mode real-time control architecture of the system was implemented and experimentally validated. We demonstrate the use of the robotic catheter for branch selection, insertion in an unknown channel under active compliance, and autonomous deployment within a 2D vasculature model. Furthermore, we developed algorithms for intra-operative catheter tracking and pose filtering. Methods presented in this paper make significant strides towards the future goal of enabling semi-autonomous navigation for neuroendovascular procedures."
10.1109/TMRB.2024.3504002,Design and Transparency Assessment of a Gait Rehabilitation Robot With Biomimetic Knee Joints,"Robotic exoskeletons are being increasingly used in clinics for the treatment of medicable disabilities. These exoskeletons, which closely couple with patients’ limbs, need to move in harmony with the endoskeleton motions. To achieve coordination, exoskeletons should be transparent; in other words, they should not interfere with natural human motion or their underlying coordination strategies. Transparency can be achieved through a bio-inspired exoskeleton design and also by implementing appropriate force control methods to maneuver exoskeleton motions. A new hybrid active-passive Gait Exoskeleton-Assisted Rehabilitation (GEAR) robot is presented here for the rehabilitation of lower limb disabilities. The GEAR robot is designed to enhance transparency incorporating a flexible hip joint and a biomimetic knee joint. The proposed GEAR robot also integrates a Remote Centered Motion (RCM) based passive mechanism to support torso and pelvic motions in two planes and features actuated exoskeleton legs in the sagittal plane for treadmill-assisted walking. The exoskeleton legs are actuated at their hip and knee joints using backdrivable actuators. To provide a natural walking experience, the hip joints of the exoskeleton legs offer two passive degrees of freedom in the frontal and transverse planes in addition to the actuated sagittal plane motion. The biomimetic design of the exoskeleton knee joint ensures alignment with the human anatomical knee joint by closely tracking the latter’s instantaneous center of rotation (ICR). To evaluate GEAR robot’s transparency, a comparative study was conducted, involving three healthy subjects. The participants walked freely on a treadmill and then with the GEAR robot operated first in a completely backdrivable (i.e., passive) mode and subsequently in an active mode. The sEMG data collected during these experiments were analyzed to assess robot’s transparency."

This kind of lightweight, scalable and green network architecture will be well-received. In a wide variety of IoT application scenarios, sensor nodes deployed in a local space, such as a multistory building, automatically form a distributed 3D wireless IoT and it can be employed to collect and analyze environmental information. Source-location privacy protection is of great importance in these networks and however, most existing schemes focus on only planar distributed networks which are not suitable for the 3D networks. In this paper, we consider a novel trace-back attack for 3D wireless IoT and then design a source-location privacy protection scheme, named DMR-3D, to defend this kind of novel attacks. In DMR-3D, the source node first selects a set of virtual locations to indirectly choose a set of agent nodes based on the cold start sphere structure and the ellipsoid communication pipeline. Then, a sophisticated mechanism is designed based on both the connected graph and Multiple Delaunay Triangulation (MDT) structure of the network to deliver packets from the source node to the destination node via these agent nodes in a relay manner. Analysis and simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme can effectively protect source-location privacy with a moderate increment of path stretch, time delay and data transmission amount."

Head direction cells (HDCs), found in the limbic system of animals, are proven to play an important role in identifying the directional heading allocentrically in the horizontal plane, independent of the animal’s location and the ambient conditions of the environment. However, practical HDC models that can be implemented in robotic applications are rarely investigated, especially those that are biologically plausible and yet applicable to the real world. In this article, we propose a computational HDC network that is consistent with several neurophysiological findings concerning biological HDCs and then implement it in robotic navigation tasks. The HDC network keeps a representation of the directional heading only relying on the angular velocity as an input. We examine the proposed HDC model in extensive simulations and real-world experiments and demonstrate its excellent performance in terms of accuracy and real-time capability."

Classical algorithms work well in the case of static obstacles but suffer from collisions in the case of dense and dynamic obstacles. Recent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms provide safe solutions for multiagent robotic motion planning systems. However, these algorithms face challenges in convergence: slow convergence speed and suboptimal converged result. Inspired by RL and representation learning, we introduced the ALN-DSAC: a hybrid motion planning algorithm where attention-based long short-term memory (LSTM) and novel data replay combine with discrete soft actor–critic (SAC). First, we implemented a discrete SAC algorithm, which is the SAC in the setting of discrete action space. Second, we optimized existing distance-based LSTM encoding by attention-based encoding to improve the data quality. Third, we introduced a novel data replay method by combining the online learning and offline learning to improve the efficacy of data replay. The convergence of our ALN-DSAC outperforms that of the trainable state of the arts. Evaluations demonstrate that our algorithm achieves nearly 100% success with less time to reach the goal in motion planning tasks when compared to the state of the arts.

Automated transportation brings numerous benefits to human beings. However, the concerns such as safety, security, and privacy keep rising. In navigation and trajectory planning, the AVs require exchanging sensory information from their own and other AVs. In such cases, when a malicious AV or faulty sensor-equipped AV comes into connectivity, it can have disruptive consequences. This paper proposes a Hybrid Deep Anomaly Detection (HDAD) approach for effective anomaly detection and cyber-attack mitigation in AVs. The Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm in HDAD approach acts over the 6G network to combat new-age cyber-attacks and provide a swift and accurate anomaly detection mechanism.

It is envisioned that the obtained results prove the effectiveness of HDAD and have an 8.2% higher accuracy rate than the existing systems."
10.1109/TNSM.2020.2997734,BALANCE: Link Flooding Attack Detection and Mitigation via Hybrid-SDN,"Link Flooding Attack (LFA) is a genre of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. LFA can cut off a target area from the network, without directly attacking the target. The attacker chooses links which when cut off will disconnect the target area and instruct the bots to flood those links with small packets. Some of the existing solutions are suitable for specific routing methods like shortest path routing or need cooperation between Autonomous Systems (AS). To overcome certain hitches of existing solutions, we have proposed a novel mechanism named BALANCE. It detects and mitigates LFA via hybrid-Software-Defined Network (SDN). SDN splits the control and data plane using OpenFlow protocol. Hybrid SDN has both legacy and SDN nodes, with a controller in the control plane. We have used Service Based Hybrid SDN (SBHS), which is a type of hybrid-SDN. BALANCE begins with an algorithm that chooses nodes in an AS to be SBHS enabled in such a way that the controller can get statistics of all the links in the AS. Next, congestion detection and location algorithms are implemented in the controller to find the congested links. Finally, LFA bot detection and mitigation algorithms are implemented in the controller to mitigate LFA. BALANCE was evaluated in testbed and emulator. We compared the results with state-of-the-art solutions. BALANCE was able to detect LFA bots at a precision of 97.64% and had HTTP response time of 2 seconds during the LFA attack."

Eye gaze-based control interfaces offer a non-invasive way to infer intent and reduce the cognitive burden on operators of complex robots. Eye gaze is traditionally used for “gaze triggering” (GT) in which staring at an object, or sequence of objects, triggers pre-programmed robotic movements. We propose an alternative approach: a neural network-based “action prediction” (AP) mode that extracts gaze-related features to recognize, and often predict, an operator’s intended action primitives. We integrated the AP mode into a shared autonomy framework capable of 3D gaze reconstruction, real-time intent inference, object localization, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic trajectory planning. Using this framework, we conducted a user study to directly compare the performance of the GT and AP modes using traditional subjective performance metrics, such as Likert scales, as well as novel objective performance metrics, such as the delay of recognition. Statistical analyses suggested that the AP mode resulted in more seamless robotic movement than the state-of-the-art GT mode, and that participants generally preferred the AP mode."
10.1109/TNSRE.2025.3574133,Adaptation Robotics and Cognitive Load: Use of a Supernumerary Finger for Activities of Daily Living,"This study investigated the impact of Supernumerary Robotic Fingers (SRFs) on cognitive function during activities of daily living (ADLs) among a group of unimpaired individuals. The increasing global prevalence of stroke has heightened the need for effective rehabilitative solutions which address both motor and cognitive dysfunction simultaneously. Robotic-aided therapies, including SRFs, provide promising means towards enhancing self-sufficiency and independence in individuals with post-stroke. However, a full understanding of how individuals with post-stroke interact and adapt to SRFs remains elusive despite being key to optimizing SRF efficacy. Electroencephalography (EEG) was employed here to study cognitive adaptability during daily SRF-assisted tasks. Specifically, functional connectivity and graph theory analytical metrics were applied to the experimental data to elucidate alterations in cerebral connectivity of the frontal cortex. Our findings reveal significant changes in EEG activity during SRF-assisted tasks, with notable impact on attention, motor planning, and emotional expression. Moreover, disruptions in local neuronal connectivity imply potential challenges in SRF-assisted activities. This work not only expands our understanding of neural dynamics, as associated with SRF use, but also lays the foundation for future research into the cognitive aspects of assistive technologies, paving the way for the design and development of more effective holistic rehabilitation interventions for stroke survivors."
10.1109/TPWRS.2021.3078446,A Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Multi-Agent Framework to Enhance Power System Resilience Using Shunt Resources,"Existing power system resilience enhancement methods, such as proactive generation rescheduling, movable sources dispatch, and network topology reconfiguration, do not explore the capability and flexibility of shunts to maintain voltage stability during and after disrupting events. Besides, existing methods rely on accurate system models that are not easily scalable for large integrated power grids. In this paper, a data-driven multi-agent framework based on a deep-reinforcement-learning algorithm is proposed to overcome the computation and scalability concerns related to precise system models and to plan for the deployment of shunts for power system resilience enhancement. Specifically, voltage violations due to outages of multiple lines during windstorms are taken as an example of a power system resilience improvement problem. Then, a multi-agent based hybrid soft actor critic (HSAC) algorithm is developed for offline siting and sizing as well as online controlling of shunt reactive power compensators to enhance voltage resilience. The HSAC algorithm is derived from the fundamental SAC algorithms that contain both continuous and discrete action spaces. The proposed multi-agent framework learns from previous experiences and eventually gets trained to determine proper locations and sizes for shunts to avoid voltage violations during multiple line failures. The proposed approach is demonstrated on the IEEE 57-bus and IEEE 300-bus systems. The results show that the proposed multi-agent framework is effective for installation planning and controlling of shunts to enhance power system resilience."
10.1109/TRO.2020.2992987,Online Hybrid Motion Planning for Dyadic Collaborative Manipulation via Bilevel Optimization,"Effective collaboration is based on online adaptation of one's own actions to the actions of their partner. This article provides a principled formalism to address online adaptation in joint planning problems such as Dyadic collaborative Manipulation (DcM) scenarios. We propose an efficient bilevel formulation that combines graph search methods with trajectory optimization, enabling robotic agents to adapt their policy on-the-fly in accordance to changes of the dyadic task. This method is the first to empower agents with the ability to plan online in hybrid spaces; optimizing over discrete contact locations, contact sequence patterns, continuous trajectories, and force profiles for co-manipulation tasks. This is particularly important in large object co-manipulation that requires changes of grasp-holds and plan adaptation. We demonstrate in simulation and with robot experiments the efficacy of the bilevel optimization by investigating the effect of robot policy changes in response to real-time alterations of the dyadic goals, eminent grasp switches, as well as optimal dyadic interactions to realize the joint task."
10.1109/TRO.2020.3036619,A Unified Formulation and Nonconvex Optimization Method for Mixed-Type Decision-Making of Robotic Systems,"Mixed-type decision-making is ubiquitously required in robotic systems and has attracted significant research interests. Examples include, but not limited to, the integrated task and motion planning and optimal control of hybrid systems involving both continuous and discrete dynamic behaviors. For decision-making of robotic systems to improve operational efficiency, safety, and/or mission success rate, they involve both discrete variables representing task allocation or transitions between discrete modes and continuous variables representing trajectories of the planned motion or states governed by differential equations. This paper formulates a class of mixed-type decision-making problems with polynomial objective and constraints as quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problems and a nonconvex optimization method based on alternating direction method of multipliers is proposed to solve the QCQP. The proposed optimization method consists of three sequential subproblems, all of which admit closed-form solutions. Moreover, convergence proof of the optimization algorithm is provided. Two representative problems, traveling salesman with obstacle avoidance and rendezvous and docking of a charging station with distinct phase constraints, are described and solved via the proposed method. Numerical simulations as well as experimental verification of both problems are presented and compared with a state-of-art method to validate the effectiveness, efficacy and robustness of the nonconvex optimization method."
10.1109/TRO.2021.3075365,Object Handovers: A Review for Robotics,"This article surveys the literature on human–robot object handovers. A handover is a collaborative joint action, where an agent, the giver, gives an object to another agent, the receiver. The physical exchange starts when the receiver first contacts the object held by the giver and ends when the giver fully releases the object to the receiver. However, important cognitive and physical processes begin before the physical exchange, including initiating implicit agreement with respect to the location and timing of the exchange. From this perspective, we structure our review into the two main phases delimited by the aforementioned events: a prehandover phase and the physical exchange. We focus our analysis on the two actors (giver and receiver) and report the state of the art of robotic givers (robot-to-human handovers) and the robotic receivers (human-to-robot handovers). We report a comprehensive list of qualitative and quantitative metrics commonly used to assess the interaction. While focusing our review on the cognitive level (e.g., prediction, perception, motion planning, and learning) and the physical level (e.g., motion, grasping, and grip release) of the handover, we also discuss safety. We compare the behaviors displayed during human-to-human handovers to the state of the art of robotic assistants and identify the major areas of improvement for robotic assistants to reach performance comparable to human interactions. Finally, we propose a minimal set of metrics that should be used in order to enable a fair comparison among the approaches."
10.1109/TRO.2022.3182487,Active Multiobject Exploration and Recognition via Tactile Whiskers,"Robotic exploration under uncertain environments is challenging when optical information is not available. In this article, we propose an autonomous solution of exploring an unknown task space based on tactile sensing alone. We first designed a whisker sensor based on MEMS barometer devices. This sensor can acquire contact information by interacting with the environment nonintrusively. This sensor is accompanied by a planning technique to generate exploration trajectories by using mere tactile perception. This technique relies on a hybrid policy for tactile exploration, which includes a proactive informative path planner for object searching, and a reactive Hopf oscillator for contour tracing. Results indicate that the hybrid exploration policy can increase the efficiency of object discovery. Last, scene understanding was facilitated by segmenting objects and classification. A classifier was developed to recognize the object categories based on the geometric features collected by the whisker sensor. Such an approach demonstrates the whisker sensor, together with the tactile intelligence, can provide sufficiently discriminative features to distinguish objects."
10.1109/TRO.2022.3226144,Active Inference and Behavior Trees for Reactive Action Planning and Execution in Robotics,"In this article, we propose a hybrid combination of active inference and behavior trees (BTs) for reactive action planning and execution in dynamic environments, showing how robotic tasks can be formulated as a free-energy minimization problem. The proposed approach allows handling partially observable initial states and improves the robustness of classical BTs against unexpected contingencies while at the same time reducing the number of nodes in a tree. In this work, we specify the nominal behavior offline, through BTs. However, in contrast to previous approaches, we introduce a new type of leaf node to specify the desired state to be achieved rather than an action to execute. The decision of which action to execute to reach the desired state is performed online through active inference. This results in continual online planning and hierarchical deliberation. By doing so, an agent can follow a predefined offline plan while still keeping the ability to locally adapt and take autonomous decisions at runtime, respecting safety constraints. We provide proof of convergence and robustness analysis, and we validate our method in two different mobile manipulators performing similar tasks, both in a simulated and real retail environment. The results showed improved runtime adaptability with a fraction of the hand-coded nodes compared to classical BTs."
10.1109/TRO.2023.3306618,Deformable Object Manipulation With Constraints Using Path Set Planning and Tracking,"In robotic deformable object manipulation (DOM) applications, constraints arise commonly from environments and task-specific requirements. Enabling DOM with constraints is, therefore, crucial for its deployment in practice. However, dealing with constraints turns out to be challenging due to many inherent factors, such as inaccessible deformation models of deformable objects (DOs) and varying environmental setups. This article presents a systematic manipulation framework for DOM subject to constraints by proposing a novel path set planning and tracking scheme. First, constrained DOM tasks are formulated into a versatile optimization formalism, which enables dynamic constraint imposition. Because of the lack of the local optimization objective and high state dimensionality, the formulated problem is not analytically solvable. To address this, planning of the path set, which collects paths of DO feedback points, is proposed subsequently to offer feasible path and motion references for the DO in constrained setups. Both theoretical analyses and computationally efficient algorithmic implementation of path set planning are discussed. Lastly, a control architecture combining path set tracking and constraint handling is designed for task execution. The effectiveness of our methods is validated in a variety of DOM tasks with constrained experimental settings."
10.1109/TRO.2024.3392079,Neurosymbolic Motion and Task Planning for Linear Temporal Logic Tasks,"This article presents a neurosymbolic framework to solve motion planning problems for mobile robots involving temporal goals. The temporal goals are described using temporal logic formulas, such as bounded linear temporal logic (LTL) and co-safe LTL to capture complex tasks. The proposed framework trains neural network (NN)-based planners that enjoy strong correctness guarantees when applying to unseen tasks, i.e., the exact task (including workspace, temporal logic formula, and errors in the dynamical models of the robot) is not available during the training of NNs. Our approach to achieving theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency is based on two insights. First, we incorporate a symbolic model into the training of NNs such that the resulting NN-based planner inherits the interpretability and correctness guarantees of the symbolic model. Moreover, the symbolic model serves as a discrete “memory,” which is necessary for satisfying temporal logic formulas. Second, we train a library of NNs offline and combine a subset of the trained NNs into a single NN-based planner at runtime when a task is revealed. In particular, we develop a novel constrained NN training procedure, named formal NN training, to enforce that each NN in the library represents a “symbol” in the symbolic model. As a result, our neurosymbolic framework enjoys the scalability and flexibility benefits of machine learning and inherits the provable guarantees from control-theoretic and formal-methods techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in both simulations and on an actual robotic vehicle and show that our framework can generalize to unseen tasks where state-of-the-art meta-reinforcement learning techniques fail."
10.1109/TRO.2024.3422054,Transferring Grasping Across Grippers: Learning–Optimization Hybrid Framework for Generalized Planar Grasp Generation,"As diverse robotic hands keep emerging for industrial and household use, designing general grasp synthesis algorithms applicable to multiple grippers remains challenging. To improve the generality and effectiveness of multigripper planar grasping algorithms, we propose a grasping framework featuring gripper-agnostic scene inference and gripper-changeable optimization. In our approach, we introduce an interaction probability map that bridges the scene inference and grasp optimization modules. It efficiently decouples the learning of grasping knowledge and modeling of gripper's kinematics. The inference module adopts a modified directional ensemble method with a generated fingertip dataset to refine scene information. In grasp optimization, we formulate gripper-kinematic constraints for different grippers according to joint types. Extensive evaluations on the Cornell Grasping Dataset (with a success rate of 95.51%) and on multifingered grippers (ten grippers in the real world) demonstrate that our hybrid approach generalizes learnable knowledge across various grippers. This work enables the direct transfer of learned grasping knowledge to new grippers in real-world applications."
10.1109/TRO.2025.3600125,Parallel MPPI With Gradient-Velocity Modulated SDF Cost for High-Performance Real-Time Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance by Robot Manipulators,"Real-time motion planning in dynamic environments presents a significant challenge for robotic manipulators. This article introduces an innovative parallel model predictive path integral (MPPI) algorithm enabling the robot to navigate swiftly and safely in such environments. Unlike the conventional MPPI methods that rely on a single sequence of Gaussian means for trajectory sampling, the proposed parallel MPPI (PMPPI) concurrently runs multiple planners with different strategies and adaptively integrates planned paths based on the current state, leveraging the advantages of different strategies and greatly improving the MPPI’s exploration capability. Moreover, a gradient-velocity modulated signed distance field (SDF) cost function that dynamically adjusts costs based on the robot’s velocity and the SDF gradient is defined, thereby promoting safer and purposeful motion planning. In the implementation, techniques like utilizing inverse kinematics solver for path guidance and sparse reward to expedite reaching time are integrated into the MPPI cost function design. Comparative evaluations against the traditional MPPI architecture and standard SDF cost designs demonstrate the superiority of the new method. Real-world experiments, including human–robot interaction, obstacle-crossing, and grasping tasks, validate the robustness and universality of our methodology, with average and maximum end effector speeds of 0.523 m/s and 1.225 m/s respectively."
10.1109/TRO.2025.3620806,Controlling Deformable Objects With Nonnegligible Dynamics: A Shape-Regulation Approach to End-Point Positioning,"Model-based manipulation of deformable objects has traditionally dealt with objects while neglecting their dynamics, thus mostly focusing on very lightweight objects at steady state. At the same time, soft robotic research has made considerable strides toward general modeling and control, despite soft robots, and deformable objects being very similar from a mechanical standpoint. In this work, we leverage these recent results to develop a control-oriented, fully dynamic framework of slender deformable objects grasped at one end by a robotic manipulator. We introduce a dynamic model of this system using functional strain parameterizations and describe the manipulation challenge as a regulation control problem. This enables us to define a fully model-based control architecture, for which we can prove analytically closed-loop stability and provide sufficient conditions for steady state convergence to the desired state. The nature of this work is intended to be markedly experimental. We provide an extensive experimental validation of the proposed ideas, tasking a robot arm with controlling the distal end of six different cables, in a given planar position and orientation in space."
10.1109/TSMC.2019.2917635,3-D Path Planning With Multiple Motions for a Gliding Robotic Dolphin,"This paper presents a three-dimensional (3-D) path planning method that combines the gliding with dolphin-like motions for the gliding robotic dolphin. A specific task that the robot uses the gliding motion for long-distance cruise and the dolphin-like motion for maneuverable obstacle avoidance is employed. The results of simulations and aquatic experiments validate the full-state dynamic model and the specific task, further offer some theoretical supports for 3-D path planning. Further, the 3-D path planning method is composed of three main components: 1) gliding path generation; 2) improved Astar (A*) algorithm; and 3) segmented Bezier curve smoothing. First, the gliding path is generated autonomously with the kinematic constraints that are obtained via the simulations of dynamic model. Furthermore, when the obstacles are detected by the sonar, an improved A* algorithm is employed to avoid the obstacles. Afterward, considering the path planned by A* is unsmoothed, a segmented Bezier curve method is presented. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, offering valuable insight into the utilization of hybrid underwater robots in the context of real-time task execution."
10.1109/TSMC.2019.2944753,Cooperative Target Tracking in Aquatic Environment Using Dual Robotic Dolphins,"This article proposes a modified rapidly exploring random tree (RRT)-based path planner and behavior-based cooperative tracking strategy for a dual robotic dolphin system to fulfill a cooperative target-tracking task. Specifically, with full consideration of both task requirements and mechatronic configuration, a robotic dolphin with a waist-caudal propulsive mechanism for thrust forces and differential bilateral flippers for maneuverability is developed. To satisfy the demand of fast path planning, a variant RRT algorithm is employed to generate feasible paths for the dual robotic dolphins with fewer waypoints, faster convergence speed, and better stability. Furthermore, a behavior-based approach in conjunction with centralized architecture is implemented to achieve high-level decision-making. Finally, simulations, analysis, as well as field experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. The success of the experiments further offers insight into the mechanisms of cooperative multirobot target tracking in aquatic environments."
10.1109/TSMC.2023.3312585,Interactive Inference: A Multi-Agent Model of Cooperative Joint Actions,"We advance a novel computational model of multi-agent, cooperative joint actions that is grounded in the cognitive framework of active inference. The model assumes that to solve a joint task, such as pressing together a red or blue button, two (or more) agents engage in a process of interactive inference. Each agent maintains probabilistic beliefs about the joint goal (e.g., Should we press the red or blue button?) and updates them by observing the other agent’s movements, while in turn selecting movements that make his own intentions legible and easy to infer by the other agent (i.e., sensorimotor communication). Over time, the interactive inference aligns both the beliefs and the behavioral strategies of the agents, hence ensuring the success of the joint action. We exemplify the functioning of the model in two simulations. The first simulation illustrates a “leaderless” joint action. It shows that when two agents lack a strong preference about their joint task goal, they jointly infer it by observing each other’s movements. In turn, this helps the interactive alignment of their beliefs and behavioral strategies. The second simulation illustrates a “leader–follower” joint action. It shows that when one agent (“leader”) knows the true joint goal, it uses sensorimotor communication to help the other agent (“follower”) infer it, even if doing this requires selecting a more costly individual plan. These simulations illustrate that interactive inference supports successful multi-agent joint actions and reproduces key cognitive and behavioral dynamics of “leaderless” and “leader–follower” joint actions observed in human–human experiments. In sum, interactive inference provides a cognitively inspired, formal framework to realize cooperative joint actions and consensus in multi-agent systems."
10.1109/TVT.2023.3344934,Distributed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Collaborative Path Planning and Scheduling in Blockchain-Based Cognitive Internet of Vehicles,"The collaborative path planning and scheduling can overcome the limitations of single vehicle intelligence to obtain a globally optimal decision strategy in cognitive Internet of Vehicles (CIoVs). The collaboration of vehicles necessitates the exchange of environmental and decision information, generating massive collaborative computing tasks with strict latency requirements. Leveraging mobile edge computing (MEC) technology, computing tasks can be processed near the vehicles to reduce latency. However, traffic congestion and computational load imbalance seriously affect traffic efficiency and computational latency. In hybrid driving scenarios, it is challenging to fulfill the diverse service requirements of vehicles with different intelligence levels. Moreover, non-collaborative tend to result in traffic congestion due to vehicle aggregation effects, while centralized solutions lack flexibility and have high computational complexity. To address these concerns, a distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (DMARL) algorithm is proposed for collaborative path planning and scheduling in a blockchain-based collaboration framework. In this framework, we model the communication, traffic situation and task processing of the system and formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize both travel time and computation latency. Last, we convert the scheduling problem for different types of vehicles into Markov decision processes (MDPs) and propose Q-learning-based DMARL algorithm to achieve proactive load balancing of both road infrastructures and MEC nodes (MECNs). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the comparison schemes in terms of load balance indexes of roads and MECNs, travel time, and computation latency."
10.1109/TVT.2024.3369089,Towards Intelligent Mobile Crowdsensing With Task State Information Sharing Over Edge-Assisted UAV Networks,"With the rapid development of edge computing technology, edge-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks have become popular, helping with fast and cost-effective data collection in mobile crowdsensing (MCS) environments. This paper investigates the online data collection problem for MCS over an edge-assisted UAV network architecture, where UAVs work to collect the data required by tasks at different on-ground point-of-interests (PoIs) in an autonomous and cooperative manner. Different from conventional edge-assisted UAV networks, edge nodes in our paper help distribute, aggregate, share, and update the task state information (TSI, e.g., if a task has been completed, or if it still requires more data), to support efficient and cost-effective data collection, e.g., avoiding repetitive and ineffective task execution. In particular, a UAV can exchange TSI with an edge node when it is within the signal coverage of the edge node, while making decisions on PoI selection and path planning in an online and decentralized manner. To address the issue of edge-assisted UAV data collection, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm using personalized training with decentralized executing (PTDE) architecture. Different from the traditional centralized training with decentralized executing (CTDE) architecture, our considered architecture adopts the agent-specific state for critic networks instead of the joint observation, thus achieving effective utilization of environmental information. Furthermore, we propose an observation enhancement algorithm based on artificial potential field (APF). Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm greatly outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of total profit, data collection ratio, geographical fairness, and energy efficiency."
10.1109/TVT.2025.3533006,Mix Q-Learning for Lane Changing: A Collaborative Decision-Making Method in Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Lane-changing decisions, which are crucial for autonomous vehicle path planning, face practical challenges due to rule-based constraints and limited data. Deep reinforcement learning has become a major research focus due to its advantages in data acquisition and interpretability. However, current models often overlook collaboration, which affects not only impacts overall traffic efficiency but also hinders the vehicle's own normal driving in the long run. To address the aforementioned issue, this paper proposes a method named Mix Q-learning for Lane Changing (MQLC) that integrates a hybrid value Q network, taking into account both collective and individual benefits for the greater good. At the collective level, our method coordinates the individual Q and global Q networks by utilizing global information. This enables agents to effectively balance their individual interests with the collective benefit. At the individual level, we integrate a deep learning-based intent recognition module into our observation and enhance the decision network. These changes provide agents with richer decision information and more precise feature extraction for improved lane-changing decisions. This strategy enables the multi-agent system to learn and formulate optimal decision-making strategies effectively. Our MQLC model, through extensive experimental results, impressively outperforms other state-of-the-art multi-agent decision-making methods, effectively improving the overall efficiency."
10.1109/TVT.2025.3554815,Reinforcement Learning-Based Low-Delay Data Collection in UAV-Assisted IoT for Secondary Geological Hazard Monitoring,"The complexity and suddenness of secondary geological disasters make it difficult to predict the risks in advance. Therefore, implementing rapid and sustainable monitoring of these hazards is crucial. However, due to the variability of geological disasters across regions and their evolution over time, ensuring timely data collection and the ability to respond flexibly to disaster conditions presents a significant challenge. This paper designs a heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) system architecture for secondary disaster monitoring scenarios, including the follower UAV (FUAV) and the collector UAV (CUAV). Based on this architecture, a reinforcement learning-based low-delay data collection scheme (RLDC) is introduced. The scheme prioritizes the data collection from sensor nodes (SNs) with higher importance and dynamically plans the paths of UAVs to adapt to environmental changes. First, to address the challenge of data delay caused by the inability to precisely locate SNs, a path search algorithm based on fuzzy SN location is proposed. Second, to reduce data transmission delay between the FUAV and the CUAV, a load status update algorithm for FUAV is presented. Lastly, considering the dynamic changes in the importance of SNs, a bidirectional long short-term memory network multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient path planning algorithm (BMADDPG) is proposed. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the scheme can adapt to dynamic secondary geological disaster monitoring scenarios and achieve low-delay data collection from SNs."

In this paper, we develop an MEC-enabled AGIN architecture to serve Internet-of-Things devices. Our objective is to minimize the total energy consumption of IoTDs and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the number of dropped tasks, while maximizing the fairness index through refined access control, UAV trajectory planning, and task scheduling. Given the complexity of the optimization problem, we reformulate the problem as a Markov decision process and define the state space, the action space, the immediate reward, and the state transfer. Considering the inclusion of discrete variables, we solve the problem by devising a novel Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) based algorithm, where the continuous action outputs of MADDPG are discretized to satisfy the coupling constraints between variables. The simulation results indicate that our algorithm outperforms baseline algorithms in both convergence speed and system energy consumption. Additionally, it demonstrates exceptional stability and robustness, leading to a substantial improvement in overall system performance."
10.1109/UR55393.2022.9826272,"Feasibility Study of LIMMS, A Multi-Agent Modular Robotic Delivery System with Various Locomotion and Manipulation Modes","The logistics of transporting a package from a storage facility to the consumer’s front door usually employs highly specialized robots often times splitting sub-tasks up to different systems, e.g., manipulator arms to sort and wheeled vehicles to deliver. More recent endeavors attempt to have a unified approach with legged and humanoid robots. These solutions, however, occupy large amounts of space thus reducing the number of packages that can fit into a delivery vehicle. As a result, these bulky robotic systems often reduce the potential for scalability and task parallelization. In this paper, we introduce LIMMS (Latching Intelligent Modular Mobility System) to address both the manipulation and delivery portion of a typical last-mile delivery while maintaining a minimal spatial footprint. LIMMS is a symmetrically designed, 6 degree of freedom (DoF) appendage-like robot with wheels and latching mechanisms at both ends. By latching onto a surface and anchoring at one end, LIMMS can function as a traditional 6-DoF manipulator arm. On the other hand, multiple LIMMS can latch onto a single box and behave like a legged robotic system where the package is the body. During transit, LIMMS folds up compactly and takes up much less space compared to traditional robotic systems. A large group of LIMMS units can fit inside of a single delivery vehicle, opening the potential for new delivery optimization and hybrid planning methods never done before. In this paper, the feasibility of LIMMS is studied and presented using a hardware prototype as well as simulation results for a range of sub-tasks in a typical last-mile delivery."
10.1109/UR57808.2023.10202470,Conflict-Based Search with Partitioned Groups of Agents for Real-World Scenarios,"Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is the problem of planning optimal paths for a group of agents without conflict. Because of the high computational complexity of MAPF, several powerful techniques have been developed to reduce the runtime under assumptions, such as the ideal kinematics of point-like agents and a discretized time domain. However, these assumptions restrict the applicability of the MAPF algorithms to real-world scenarios. Continuous-time conflict-based search (CCBS), a variant of CBS, was recently proposed to generalize MAPF problems to continuous-time and non-grid domains. In this study, we propose CCBS with partitioned groups of agents (CCBS-PGA), a hybrid approach that uses CCBS as the main MAPF solver and adopts the idea of prioritized planning (PP) for enhanced scalability. CCBS-PGA runs CCBS for each group of the partitioned agents and assigns unique priorities to the individual group. We also introduce two features that reflect realistic robot kinematics; rotational velocities of robots and safety distances. This approach does not rely on the simplified assumptions while alleviating the computational complexity of MAPF problems involving numerous agents. We demonstrate its effectiveness in various environments using differential-wheeled robots."

By integrating Voronoi Cells with an adaptive blend of A* and Hybrid A* algorithms, the proposed combinational planner ensures the generation of feasible and executable trajectories, guaranteeing efficient and collision-free navigation of multiple agents in dynamically complex environments. An additional deadlock avoidance strategy is proposed to further enhance the safety layer. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in terms of efficiency, collision avoidance, and deadlock resolution through simulations in diverse, randomly generated environments. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of dynamic considerations and obstacle avoidance, making it a practical realtime motion planning approach for connected non-holonomic agents in complex environments."

10.1109/VTC2023-Fall60731.2023.10333800,Deep Reinforcement Learning for Image-Based Multi-Agent Coverage Path Planning,"Image-based Multi-Agent Coverage Path Planning (MACPP) utilizes images as input to control multiple agents touring all nodes in a map, minimizing task duration and node revisiting. State-of-the-art (SOTA) studies have applied Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) to automate MACPP, primarily focusing on minimizing task duration. However, these approaches overlook the issue of repeated node visits, resulting in longer task durations and limited real-world applicability. To tackle this challenge, we develop a novel MADRL solution, referred to as MADRL with Mask Soft Attention, to minimize task duration and node re-visiting simultaneously. Our method uses mask soft attention to extract key features from raw image observations while masking task-independent features, reducing computational complexity and improving sample efficiency. We also cascade a multi-actor-critic architecture to accommodate even more agents with ease. Each agent is equipped with an actor to learn an action policy, and a shared critic evaluates a state value. To validate our approach, we implement seven SOTA MADRL methods in the MACPP area as baselines. Simulation results show that our method significantly outperforms the baselines regarding task duration and the number of times the node is repeatedly visited."

However, limitation of single STAR-RIS inspire us to integrate the concept of multi-hop transmissions, as focused on RIS in existing research. Therefore, we propose the novel architecture of multi-hop STAR-RISs to achieve a wider range of full-plane service coverage. In this paper, we intend to solve active beamforming of the base station and passive beamforming of STAR-RISs, aiming for maximizing the energy efficiency constrained by hardware limitation of STAR-RISs. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the on-off state of STAR-RIS elements on energy efficiency. To tackle the complex problem, a Multi-Agent Global and locAl deep Reinforcement learning (MAGAR) algorithm is designed. The global agent elevates the collaboration among local agents, which focus on individual learning. In numerical results, we observe the significant improvement of MAGAR compared to the other benchmarks, including Q-learning, multi-agent deep Q network (DQN) with golbal reward, and multi-agent DQN with local rewards. Moreover, the proposed architecture of multi-hop STAR-RISs achieves the highest energy efficiency compared to mode switching based STAR-RISs, conventional RISs and deployment without RISs or STAR-RISs."
10.1109/VTC2024-Spring62846.2024.10683307,Coverage Path Planning for AUVs Cooperative Environment Detection in Integrated Underwater Acoustic Communication and Detection Networks,"In this paper, we investigate the coverage path planning (CPP) scheme for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) cooperative environment detection in integrated underwater acoustic communication and detection networks (UCDNs), where multiple AUVs detect unexplored oceanic environments and avoid obstacles. Firstly, we present the detection range prediction model related to oceanic environmental parameters and propose the detection and communication scheme in UCDNs. Secondly, to conduct the cooperative environment detection mission, we formulate the CPP problem as a mixed combinatorial and sequential quadratic optimization problem to maximize the coverage ratio and minimize the path length of AUVs. To solve this problem, we investigate the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO)-based CPP scheme. In specific, the CPP problem is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Since the path planning of the AUVs is not only related to the local information but also the other AUVs' information, the information should be shared among AUVs based on the UCDNs. Furthermore, we introduce the MAPPO-based algorithm under the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture. Extensive simulations are carried out to demonstrate the strength of the proposed scheme."

10.1109/WCONF64849.2025.11233300,Research on Path Planning Algorithm in Autonomous Vehicle,"The path planning of autonomous vehicle needs to take into account the adaptability of complex environment and real-time. This study proposes path planning strategies that integrate traditional methods and intelligent algorithms for both unstructured and structured road scenarios. In unstructured roads, a bidirectional artificial potential field method combined with a fifth order Bezier curve is constructed to improve the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm framework. By using bidirectional gravitational synergy to avoid local minima, high-order curve fitting and intelligent optimization are utilized to enhance path smoothness; Structured roads adopt a hierarchical planning architecture, with the global layer generating topological paths using a hybrid A* algorithm, and the local layer achieving dynamic obstacle avoidance through Frenet coordinate system and improved deep reinforcement learning (SQDQN). The algorithm has been validated for effectiveness in simulation and real vehicle testing, with a 9.5% reduction in path length and a 75% reduction in curvature fluctuation in unstructured scenarios; The decision delay in structured scenarios has been reduced from 180ms to 102ms, and the obstacle avoidance success rate has been increased to 97.6%. By utilizing CUDA parallel computing and model lightweight design, the algorithm is ensured to meet real-time requirements on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier platform. The research results provide theoretical support and technical solutions for the full scenario path planning of autonomous driving. In the future, we will further explore multimodal information fusion and multi-agent collaborative optimization to enhance the algorithm's generalization ability in complex traffic environments."

In simulation experiments, DeepPath LC reduced task completion time by 13.3% and unit carbon emissions by 14.3% compared to A * algorithm in a single AGV static environment; In multi AGV dynamic scenarios, the collision rate is reduced by 82.3% and the load imbalance rate is reduced by 42%. In high-density task environments, the model achieves a 15.4% reduction in task completion time and a 19% increase in carbon efficiency compared to the DQN-PER algorithm through dynamic priority scheduling. Research has shown that the model effectively achieves intelligent and green collaborative optimization by optimizing the decision architecture, improving the experience replay mechanism, and implementing multi-objective collaborative strategies."

Thanks to sensors and machine learning algorithms, it is possible to gather information on the state of health of individual seedlings, fruits controlling the injection of nutrients, water and plat protection products within hydroponic greenhouse taking also into account energy efficiency in the design of new control loops for automation in this domain. In this article, we present the architectural proposal of a robotic handling system designed to optimize the positioning of the seeds inside a domestic hydroponic greenhouse, aiming to achieve an automatic and more precise seedlings process. The main contribution of the article is to highlight the relevance on obtaining the optimal positioning of seeds for future growth of plants in the controlled environment.

While various vertical applications of surgical robots offer different levels of autonomy, from complete human control to reduced levels of human input for a limited range of surgical tasks, the applications of spine surgical robots still remain at an infancy stage. Big players such as Medtronic Mazor X Stealth Edition and Globus ExcelsiousGPS mainly focus on the navigation and imaging system. Although most companies are actively exploring the possibilities of automating part or all tasks during a spine procedure, few companies have realized that at clinical or commercial stage. Vista Robotics is one of the few close to enabling automation in specific tasks during a spine surgery at the clinical stage, such as discectomy and endplate preparation. The paper explains from theoretical, product development and clinical aspects how certain artificial intelligence applications on active robotic assisted spine surgery are being realized at development and clinical stages. Applications include but are not limited to: automated discectomy and endplate preparation, self-regulated intra-operative navigation, AI-enhanced preoperative surgical planning, automated endoscopic decompression, automated laminectomy.

10.1109/WI-IAT59888.2023.00062,Implementing BDI Continual Temporal Planning for Robotic Agents,"Making autonomous agents effective in real-life applications requires the ability to decide at run-time and a high degree of adaptability to unpredictable and uncontrollable events. Reacting to events is still a fundamental ability for an agent, but it has to be boosted up with proactive behaviors that allow the agent to explore alternatives and decide at run-time for optimal solutions. This calls for a continuous planning as part of the deliberation process that makes an agent able to reconsider plans on the base of temporal constraints and changes of the environment. Online planning literature offers several approaches used to select the next action on the base of a partial exploration of the solution space. In this paper, we propose a BDI continuous temporal planning framework, where interleave planning and execution loop is used to integrate online planning with the BDI control-loop. The framework has been implemented with the ROS2 robotic framework and planning algorithms offered by JavaFF."
10.1109/WRCSARA60131.2023.10261787,Bayesian Optimization of Double-SAC Robotic Arm Path Planning Using Recent Prioritized Experience Replay,"As for the path planning of robotic arms, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have recently been developed. However, the high-dimensional action space and state space will result in reward sparsity and low training efficiency of robotic arm path planning. We propose a Bayesian optimization of Double-SAC algorithm using recent priority experience replay to solve these issues. We first propose the sampling method of recent prioritized experience replay (RPER), which combines recent sampling and prioritized experience replay (PER). The interval of experience pool is divided according to the recent sampling method, and sampling is performed according to the sample priority of the interval. Then we adopt a Bayesian optimization method that reduces the variance of the random strategy and improve the quality of the sampled actions. The larger variance is more beneficial for exploring the environment. Smaller variance is advantageous for exploiting good experiences to obtain higher returns. Our approach finds a good balance between exploration and exploitation. We train two Soft Actor Critic (SAC) agents to obtain two independent probability distributions, and a Bayesian optimizer is adopted to combine the two distributions to design a hybrid strategy. The hybrid strategy can output better actions according to the uncertainty estimation of the distribution, and further enhance training efficiency and stability. Finally, simulation tests are performed on the ROS-Gazebo platform, and the simulation results illustrate that the algorithm proposed in this paper converges faster and has a shorter training time than the original algorithm in terms of path planning performance."

This paper develops a new simulation platform for the robot soccer game, and it has the advantage of open architecture, such that the formation control scheme, the path planning strategy for multiple robots, and many other algorithms can be implemented and tested. Specifically, both a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) scheme and a role-assignment-based method have been successfully realized in this platform to drive multiple robots to play the soccer game, including 2V2,3V3,4V4, and so on. It is believed that the developed simulation environment can be used for data collection and transfer learning (TL), hence bridging the gap of Sim2Real technique in actual implementations."

Simulation of these hybrid control approaches to robotics can be a useful validation tool for robot users and architecture designers, but presents the key challenge of working with discrete and continuous representations of the robot, its environment and its mission plans. In this work we address this challenge showcasing a unified DEVS-based hybrid simulation platform. We model and simulate the hybrid robotic software architecture of a fixed-wing UAV, including the full stack of controllers involved: discrete, hybrid and continuous. We validate the approach experimentally on a typical UAV mapping mission and show that with our unified approach we are able to achieve simulation speed-ups up to one order of magnitude above our previous Software In The Loop simulation setup."

10.1117/12.3013861,"Modular, Hierarchical Machine Learning for Sequential Goal Completion","Given a maze populated with different objects, one may task a robot with a sequential goal completion task, e.g. 1) pick up a key then 2) unlock the door then 3) unlock the treasure chest. A typical machine learning (ML) solution would involve a monolithically trained artificial neural network (ANN). However, if the sequence of goals or the goals themselves change, then the ANN must be significantly (or, at worst, completely) retrained. Instead of a monolithic ANN, a modular ML component would be 1) independently optimizable (task-agnostic) and 2) arbitrarily reconfigurable with other ML modules. This work describes a modular, hierarchical ML framework by integrating two emerging ML techniques: 1) cognitive map learners (CML) and 2) hyperdimensional computing (HDC). A CML is a collection of three single layer ANNs (matrices) collaboratively trained to learn the topology of an abstract graph. Here, two CMLs were constructed, one describing locations on in 2D physical space and the other the relative distribution of objects found in this space. Each CML node states was encoded as a high-dimensional vector to utilize HDC, an ML algebra, for symbolic reasoning over these high-dimensional “symbol” vectors. In this way, each sub-goal above was described by algebraic equations of CML node states. Multiple, independently trained CMLs were subsequently assembled together to navigate a maze to solve a sequential goal task. Critically, changes to these goals required only localized changes in the CML-HDC architecture, as opposed to a global ANN retraining scheme. This framework therefore enabled a more traditional engineering approach to ML, akin to digital logic design. © 2024 SPIE."
10.1145/3319502.3374779,Decision-Making for Bidirectional Communication in Sequential Human-Robot Collaborative Tasks,"Communication is critical to collaboration; however, too much of it can degrade performance. Motivated by the need for effective use of a robot's communication modalities, in this work, we present a computational framework that decides if, when, and what to communicate during human-robot collaboration. The framework, titled CommPlan, consists of a model specification process and an execution-time POMDP planner. To address the challenge of collecting interaction data, the model specification process is hybrid : where part of the model is learned from data, while the remainder is manually specified. Given the model, the robot's decision-making is performed computationally during interaction and under partial observability of human's mental states. We implement CommPlan for a shared workspace task, in which the robot has multiple communication options and needs to reason within a short time. Through experiments with human participants, we confirm that CommPlan results in the effective use of communication capabilities and improves human-robot collaboration."
10.1145/3319502.3374832,When Humans Aren't Optimal: Robots that Collaborate with Risk-Aware Humans,"In order to collaborate safely and efficiently, robots need to anticipate how their human partners will behave. Some of today's robots model humans as if they were also robots, and assume users are always optimal. Other robots account for human limitations, and relax this assumption so that the human is noisily rational. Both of these models make sense when the human receives deterministic rewards: i.e., gaining either $100 or $130 with certainty. But in real-world scenarios, rewards are rarely deterministic. Instead, we must make choices subject to risk and uncertainty-and in these settings, humans exhibit a cognitive bias towards suboptimal behavior. For example, when deciding between gaining $100 with certainty or $130 only 80\% of the time, people tend to make the risk-averse choice-even though it leads to a lower expected gain! In this paper, we adopt a well-known Risk-Aware human model from behavioral economics called Cumulative Prospect Theory and enable robots to leverage this model during human-robot interaction (HRI). In our user studies, we offer supporting evidence that the Risk-Aware model more accurately predicts suboptimal human behavior. We find that this increased modeling accuracy results in safer and more efficient human-robot collaboration. Overall, we extend existing rational human models so that collaborative robots can anticipate and plan around suboptimal human behavior during HRI."

There are possible applications for such mechanisms where low moving inertia is required. One of the challenges in the design of cable-driven mechanisms is to identify the regions where cables remain in tension. However, routing of the cables through multiple links i.e., cable co-sharing, alters the performance characteristics of the manipulator. This paper discusses the effect of cable co-sharing on the workspace of serial chain systems. Further, changes to be made in architecture to facilitate co-sharing is discussed. A planar 2 link cable-driven serial chain manipulator is considered for the analysis to present the advantages offered by co-sharing architecture in designing a compact system."

The design aims at finding the link parameters of the arm in such a manner that it possesses a singularity-free region that is bigger than a specified volume, in the shape of a cylinder. It is also required that the static performance of the manipulator, over this region, is better than a specified nominal level, quantified in terms of the actuator torques required to carry a fixed payload. The design problem is posed as a bi-objective optimisation problem, and solved using a GA-based optimiser code, namely, NSGA-II. The method is demonstrated via a numerical example. The Pareto-optimal solutions are obtained in a reasonable time, and the design achieves the required targets, thus demonstrating its efficacy."

Considering the architectural space key exits and doors as network nodes, the paper presents combining dynamic crowd model and reinforcement learning strategy. The strategy with high training efficiency considering obstacles setup, crowd movement, and exits environment, the learning agent interacts dynamically with surrounding environment, and learns the shortest time path to exit.

It is appearing in smart materials and machinic intelligence, for diverse purposes, being inspired by natural processes and organisms. The main application of Biomimicry has been to produce artifacts and ideas from what we know that nature has already done. While the mimesis has been removed from the vocabulary of Art, the works of some artists are still full of possibilities to discuss under the concept of Biomimetics. Many artists have dedicated themselves to the development of works using the poiesis of hybridization and mimicry. How close is the approach of Biomimetics? As examples, are brought Walmor Corr\^{e}a, Patr\'{\i}cia Piccinini, Liu Xue, Alessandro Boezio, Joan Fontcoberta and Pere Formiguera. This discussion is the starting point for my project ""VIRIDIUM"", in which Im developing some semiautonomous and translucent robots, printed in 3D. The poetic is the capacity that nature has of hybridizing and evolving, spontaneously, as well as being hybridized by genetic manipulation. I propose the development of objects / beings that do not exist in the nature but refer and simulate behaviors of those who inhabit the world, in different kingdoms of Nature. I describe the first stage of the project, which focuse the Plantae kingdom (also known as Metaphyta). Besides the Biomimicry (Biomimetics) concepts I bring the concept of Artification [3][16], as a possible model of understanding the poetic process, both in ""VIRIDIUM"" and in the works of the artists chosen."
10.1145/3366423.3382668,Architectures for Autonomy: Towards an Equitable Web of Data in the Age of AI,"Today, the Web connects over half the world's population, many of whom use it to stay connected to a multiplicity of vital digital public and private services, impacting every aspect of their lives. Access to the Web and underlying Internet is seen as essential for all—even a fundamental human right [7]. However, many contend that the power structure on large swaths of the Web has become inverted; they argue that instead of being run for and by users, it has been made to serve the platforms themselves, and the powerful actors that sponsor such platforms to run targeted advertising on their behalf. In such an ad-driven platform ecosystem, users, including their beliefs, data, and attention, have become traded commodities [13].There is concern that the emergence of powerful data analytics and AI techniques threaten to further entrench the power of these same platforms, by putting the control of powerful and valuable new capabilities in their hands rather than the users who produce the data [10]. The fear is that it is giving rise to data and AI monopolies [2,6]. Individuals have no long-term control or agency over their personal data or many of the decisions made using it.This may be one reason we are witnessing a so called Renaissance of Ethics - a plethora of initiatives and activities that call out the range of threats to individual autonomy, self-determination and privacy, the lack of transparency and accountability, a concern around bias and fairness, equity and access in our data driven ecosystem. This keynote will argue as the remaining half of the world's population comes online, we need digital infrastructures that will promote a plurality of methods of data sovereignty and governance instead of imposing a ’single policy fits-all’ platform governance model, which has strained and undermined the ability for governments to protect and support their citizens digital rights.This is an opportunity to re-imagine and re-architect elements of the Web, data, algorithms and institutions so as to ensure a more equitable distribution of these new digital potentialities. Based on our existing research we have been developing methods and tech-nologies pertaining to the following core principles: informational self-determination and autonomy, balanced and equitable access to AI and data, accountability and redress of AI/algorithmic decisions, and new models of ethical participation and contribution.The technology that underpins the modern web has seen exponential rates of change that have continuously improved the capabilities of the processors, memory and communications upon which it depends. This has enabled huge amounts of data to be linked and stored as well as providing for increasing use of AI. A variety of projects will be described where we sought to unlock the potential of this increasingly powerful infrastructure [1, 4, 5, 9]. The lessons learnt through various efforts to develop the Seman-tic Web [8] and the insights gained through the release of open data at scale will be reviewed [11]. We will review our attempts to understand how the blending of humans, algorithms and data at scale results in social machines whose emergent properties results in behaviour and problem solving which any of the individual elements would not have been able to achieve [12]. Understanding these emergent properties of the web was one of the motivating factors behind the establishment of Web Science [3]. We will briefly review the prospects for Web Science.The importance of data as infrastructure to enable wide spread innovation, accountability and trusted reproducible science will be stressed. Recent work will be described that seeks to promote an equitable and balanced Web environment in which privacy can be upheld and better mutualities realised. Developments in technical and institutional architectures that could underpin an Ethical Web of data will be outlined."
10.1145/3369759,Parallel Data Distribution Management on Shared-memory Multiprocessors,"The problem of identifying intersections between two sets of d-dimensional axis-parallel rectangles appears frequently in the context of agent-based simulation studies. For this reason, the High Level Architecture (HLA) specification—a standard framework for interoperability among simulators—includes a Data Distribution Management (DDM) service whose responsibility is to report all intersections between a set of subscription and update regions. The algorithms at the core of the DDM service are CPU-intensive, and could greatly benefit from the large computing power of modern multi-core processors. In this article, we propose two parallel solutions to the DDM problem that can operate effectively on shared-memory multiprocessors. The first solution is based on a data structure (the interval tree) that allows concurrent computation of intersections between subscription and update regions. The second solution is based on a novel parallel extension of the Sort Based Matching algorithm, whose sequential version is considered among the most efficient solutions to the DDM problem. Extensive experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms confirm their effectiveness on taking advantage of multiple execution units in a shared-memory architecture."

The rapid growth in this area is usually hindered by the long-standing problem of data scarcity as these systems are expected to learn syntax, grammar, decision making, and reasoning from insufficient amounts of task-specific dataset. The recently introduced pre-trained language models have the potential to address the issue of data scarcity and bring considerable advantages by generating contextualized word embeddings. These models are considered counterpart of ImageNet in NLP and have demonstrated to capture different facets of language such as hierarchical relations, long-term dependency, and sentiment. In this short survey paper, we discuss the recent progress made in the field of pre-trained language models. We also deliberate that how the strengths of these language models can be leveraged in designing more engaging and more eloquent conversational agents. This paper, therefore, intends to establish whether these pre-trained models can overcome the challenges pertinent to dialogue systems, and how their architecture could be exploited in order to overcome these challenges. Open challenges in the field of dialogue systems have also been deliberated."

In this article, we study how adaptive coaching interactions can be designed to help people develop sustainable healthy behaviors. We leverage the common model of cognition (CMC) [31] as a framework for unifying several behavior change theories that are known to be useful in human–human coaching. We motivate a set of interactive system desiderata based on the CMC-based view of behavior change. Then, we propose PARCoach, an interactive system that addresses the desiderata. PARCoach helps a trainee pick a relevant health goal, set an implementation intention, and track their behavior. During this process, the trainee identifies a specific goal-directed behavior as well as the situational context in which they will perform it. PARCCoach uses this information to send notifications to the trainee, reminding them of their chosen behavior and the context. We report the results from a 4-week deployment with 60 participants. Our results support the CMC-based view of behavior change and demonstrate that the desiderata for proposed interactive system design is useful in producing behavior change."

This paper is to investigate the accuracy of two methods to detect Pulmonary Tuberculosis based on the patient chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Various image preprocessing methods are tested to find the combination that yields the highest accuracy. Moreover, a hybrid approach using the original statistical computer-aided detection method combined with Neural Networks was also investigated. Simulations have been carried out based on 406 normal images \&amp; 394 abnormal images. The simulations show that a cropped region of interest coupled with contrast enhancement yields excellent results. When further enhancing the images with the hybrid method even better results are achieved."

Nowadays, new gadgets and devices are bringing innovative solutions to make problems simplified and effortless in our daily life. So, the innovation of an autonomous dust sweeper bot can make cleaning tasks effortless and user-friendly. For the last few years, self-directed cleaners have taken major attention by providing customer satisfaction because of its usefulness in helping humans by minimizing physical effort in day to day cleaning purposes. Consequently, a new type of vacuum cleaner bot is implemented by using local resources which can solve the dust problem automatically. One of the additional features of this vacuum cleaner bot is its running capability using a hybrid plugin/solar energy. This bot can repeatedly keep clean places like industries, hospitals, and universities. This bot follows a predetermined line in automatic mode or can be controlled by a joystick. This structure also can detect obstacles on its following path to avoid accidents. It has the charging capability using solar radiation or can be charged from the mains during cloudy days. It collects dust by its cyclone separator vacuum cleaner \& cleaning brush, which is designed for the first time by our team. This bot is designed to run on ultra-low power (only 80 W), whereas the lowest power of a conventional vacuum cleaner in the market is around 1800W.Finally, we can say that this renewable energy-driven smart cyclone separator vacuum cleaner bot is the finest bot that can solve the dust problem by itself. It has far-reaching potential to be the best commercial product in the cleaning era with the assurance of a healthy environment."
10.1145/3377812.3381398,Towards DO-178C certification of adaptive learning UAV agents designed with a cognitive architecture,"Adaptive and Learning Agents (ALAs) bring computational intelligence to their Cyber Physical host systems to adapt to novel situations encountered in their complex operational environment. They do so by learning from their experience to improve their performance. RTCA DO-178C specifies a stringent certification process for airborne software which represents several challenges when applied to an ALA in regards of functional completeness, functional correctness, testability and adaptability. This research claims that it is possible to certify an Adaptive Learning Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Agent designed as per a Cognitive Architecture with current DO-178C certification process when leveraging a qualified tool (DO-330), Model-Based Development and Verification (DO-331) and Formal Methods (DO-333). The research consists in developing, as a case study, an ALA embedded in a UAV aimed at neutralizing rogue UAVs in the vicinity of civil airports and test it in the field. This article is the plan to complete, by end 2022, a dissertation currently in its confirmation phase."
10.1145/3383652.3423893,Spontaneous Facial Behavior Revolves Around Neutral Facial Displays,"With forty-six Action Units (AUs) forming the building blocks in the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), millions of facial configurations can be formed. Most research has focused on a subset of combinations to determine the link between facial configurations and emotions. Despite the value of this research for psychological and computational reasons, it is not clear what the most common combinations of AUs are to form the most commonly expressed facial configurations. We used three diverse corpora with human coded facial action units for a computational analysis. The analysis demonstrated that the largest portion of facial behavior consists of the absence of AU activations, yielding only one specific facial configuration, that of the neutral face. These results are important for cognitive scientists, computer graphics designers and virtual human developers alike. They suggest that only a relatively small number of AU combinations are initially needed for the creation of natural facial behavior in Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs)."

With the population growing constantly, there are inventions of new means in the production of food to cater for those demands. Improvement in a variety of technologies is one of such effort conducted for the cause. Robotics or chemical technologies may not be the only improvements that could be exercised. Internet of Things (IoT) technology is one of an application widely used currently. The study aims to establish a less manpower plantation in smart city with the use of IoT technology to improve the crop cultivation. In preliminary, a wireless soil moisture monitoring and irrigation system was developed. The system aims to monitor the moisture and properties of soil for plants. At the same time, with a self-sufficient and self-organized irrigation system based on the water-control algorithm. The developed system covered the three layers in IoT architecture: perception layer, network layer and application layer. In perception layer, a microcontroller, soil moisture sensors and solenoid valves acted as the sensors, transducers and actuators. Wireless networking technology (WiFi) was used as the communication for data transmitting and receiving. Through the developed application, humidity and irrigation volume were collected, recorded and analyzed. These preliminary results help in visualizing the concept of a less manpower plantation in smart city."
10.1145/3387939.3391591,Software architecture and task plan co-adaptation for mobile service robots,"Self-adaptive systems increasingly need to reason about and adapt both structural and behavioral system aspects, such as in mobile service robots, which must reason about missions that they need to achieve and the architecture of the software executing them. Deciding how to best adapt these systems to run time changes is challenging because it entails considering mutual dependencies between the software architecture that the system is running and the outcome of plans for completing tasks, while also considering multiple trade-offs and uncertainties. Considering all these aspects in planning for adaptation often yields large solution spaces which cannot be adequately explored at run time. We address this challenge by proposing a planning approach able to consider the impact of mutual dependencies between software architecture and task planning on the satisfaction of mission goals. The approach is able to reason quantitatively about the outcome of adaptation decisions handling both the reconfiguration of the system's architecture and adaptation of task plans under uncertainty and in a rich trade-off space. Our results show: (i) feasibility of run-time decision-making for self-adaptation in an otherwise intractable solution space by dividing-and-conquering adaptation into architecture reconfiguration and task planning sub-problems, and (ii) improved quality of adaptation decisions with respect to decision making that does not consider dependencies between architecture and task planning."
10.1145/3387940.3391501,MSABot: A Chatbot Framework for Assisting in the Development and Operation of Microservice-Based Systems,"Microservice architecture (MSA) has become a popular architectural style. The main advantages of MSA include modularization and scalability. However, the development and maintenance of Microservice-based systems are more complex than traditional monolithic architecture. This research plans to develop a novel Chatbot system, referred to as MSABot (Microservice Architecture Bot), to assist in the development and operation of Microservice-based systems by using Chatbots. MSABot integrates a variety of tools to allow users to understand the current status of Microservice development and operation, and to push the information of system errors or risks to users. For the operators who take over the maintenance of Microservices, MSABot also allows them to quickly understand the overall service architecture and the operation status of each service. Besides, we invited multiple users who are familiar with the technology of Microservice or ChapOps to evaluate MSABot. The results of the survey show that more than 90\% of the respondents believe that MSABot can adequately support the development and maintenance of Microservice-based systems."
10.1145/3388218.3388225,Multiple Waypoint Mobile Robot Path Planning Using Neighborhood Search Genetic Algorithms,"In this paper, we present a Neighborhood Search Genetic Algorithms (NSGAs) for mobile robot path planning. GAs have been used successfully in a variety of path planning problem because they can search the space of all possible paths and provide the optimal one. The convergence process of GAs might be lengthy compared to traditional search techniques that depend on local search methods. We propose a hybrid approach that allows GAs to combine both the advantages of GAs and local search algorithms. GAs will create a multiple waypoint path allowing a mobile robot to navigate through static obstacles and finding the optimal path in order to approach the target location without collision. The proposed NSGAs has been examined over four different path planning case studies with varying complexity. The performance of the enhanced GA has been compared with A-star algorithm (A*) standard GA, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The obtained results show that the proposed approach is able to get good results compared to other algorithms."
10.1145/3392858,C-Reference: Improving 2D to 3D Object Pose Estimation Accuracy via Crowdsourced Joint Object Estimation,"Converting widely-available 2D images and videos, captured using an RGB camera, to 3D can help accelerate the training of machine learning systems in spatial reasoning domains ranging from in-home assistive robots to augmented reality to autonomous vehicles. However, automating this task is challenging because it requires not only accurately estimating object location and orientation, but also requires knowing currently unknown camera properties (e.g., focal length). A scalable way to combat this problem is to leverage people's spatial understanding of scenes by crowdsourcing visual annotations of 3D object properties. Unfortunately, getting people to directly estimate 3D properties reliably is difficult due to the limitations of image resolution, human motor accuracy, and people's 3D perception (i.e., humans do not ""see"" depth like a laser range finder). In this paper, we propose a crowd-machine hybrid approach that jointly uses crowds' approximate measurements of multiple in-scene objects to estimate the 3D state of a single target object. Our approach can generate accurate estimates of the target object by combining heterogeneous knowledge from multiple contributors regarding various different objects that share a spatial relationship with the target object. We evaluate our joint object estimation approach with 363 crowd workers and show that our method can reduce errors in the target object's 3D location estimation by over 40\%, while requiring only $35$\% as much human time. Our work introduces a novel way to enable groups of people with different perspectives and knowledge to achieve more accurate collective performance on challenging visual annotation tasks."

We propose an experiment to test the development of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents to learn to vary a daily grid price signal to optimize behavioral energy shift in office workers. We describe our application of Batch Constrained Q Learning and Soft Actor Critic (SAC) as RL agents and Social Cognitive Theory, LSTM networks, and linear regression as planning models. We report limited success within simulation with SAC and linear regression. Finally, we propose an experiment timeline for consideration."
10.1145/3400302.3415759,DaDu series: fast and efficient robot accelerators,"Research on accelerators for robotics is increasing. This article introduces the kinematics, motion planning and collision detection algorithms and our accelerators in robotics, and then analyzes their advantages, disadvantages and bottlenecks. In view of the shortcomings of the existing accelerators, this paper will show a series accelerators named ""DaDu"" that we have proposed. For kinematics, we have proposed Dadu [1] to accelerate the inverse kinematics algorithm, which achieves 1700x speedup than the CPU implementation, 30x speedup than the GPU implementation, and 776x higher energy efficiency than the GPU implementation. For motion planning, we have proposed Dadu-P [2] to accelerate the PRM algorithm. It can get 26.5x speedup than an existing CPU-based approach for collision detection. Furthermore, with an incremental approach, the performance of motion planning can further be improved by 10x while the solution quality is degraded by 10\% only. For the collision detection algorithm in motion planning, the proposed accelerator Dadu-CD [3] elaborates the in-memory processing architecture, achieving at least 5x speedup than Dadu-P in the total planning time and 9.55x lower energy consumption than Dadu-P."
10.1145/3404555.3404639,Urban Driving Based on Condition Imitation Learning and Multi-Period Information Fusion,"In recent years, autonomous driving has become a hot topic, especially in the complex urban road environment. The visual algorithm is the most used scheme for autonomous driving. The traditional condition imitation learning adopts the end-to-end deep learning network. But it lacks interpretability, and the ability of feature extraction and expression of network is limited. There are still some problems in the local planning and detail implementation. To solve these problems, we propose to use the deep residual network architecture and add the dual attention module to learn driving skills, which are closer to human beings. To further improve the detailed feature extraction ability of the network, the deeper residual network architecture is used. To adaptively integrate the global context long-range dependence of the image in the spatial and feature dimensions, the dual attention module is adopted to improve the ability of network expression. At the same time, in order to make full use of the multi-period attribute information of the camera image itself, we redesign the network architecture, extract, integrate the three-way temporal information features and the high-level semantics, and increase the interpretability of the temporal information of the model. This method is tested on the CARLA simulator. The experimental results show that compared with the benchmark algorithm, it achieves better driving effect. Deeper feature extraction and multi-period information fusion can effectively improve the driving ability and driving completion of the agent."
10.1145/3411564.3411656,Web Accessibility Evolution in the Brazilian Government,"The Brazilian Federal Government has published many pieces of legislation to assure the rights of people with disabilities with respect to both architectural and digital accessibility. Unfortunately, studies conducted in 2015 and 2017 have shown that the web portals of many federal agencies, including those with ministry status, failed to fully comply with the current legislation in many aspects. The aim of this paper is to re-evaluate the web portals of the Brazilian Federal Ministries to assess how much they evolved since 2015 concerning their compliance with the Brazilian Accessibility Model (e-MAG); usage of the Digital Government Identity; publication of the Circumstantial Report and Accessibility Work Plan; and usage of recommended Content Management Systems. The results of our evaluation show that compliance with the e-MAG standard with ratings based on the different types of guidelines violated slightly improved, but the number of instances of violations of guidelines significantly dropped; the usage of the Digital Government Identity has increased satisfactorily as well as the usage of recommended tools for developing and maintaining web portals; and only few web portals published the Circumstantial Report and Accessibility Work Plan."
10.1145/3411764.3445109,Disagree? You Must be a Bot! How Beliefs Shape Twitter Profile Perceptions,"In this paper, we investigate the human ability to distinguish political social bots from humans on Twitter. Following motivated reasoning theory from social and cognitive psychology, our central hypothesis is that especially those accounts which are opinion-incongruent are perceived as social bot accounts when the account is ambiguous about its nature. We also hypothesize that credibility ratings mediate this relationship. We asked N = 151 participants to evaluate 24 Twitter accounts and decide whether the accounts were humans or social bots. Findings support our motivated reasoning hypothesis for a sub-group of Twitter users (those who are more familiar with Twitter): Accounts that are opinion-incongruent are evaluated as relatively more bot-like than accounts that are opinion-congruent. Moreover, it does not matter whether the account is clearly social bot or human or ambiguous about its nature. This was mediated by perceived credibility in the sense that congruent profiles were evaluated to be more credible resulting in lower perceptions as bots."
10.1145/3411764.3445124,Empowering Dyads of Older Adults With Mild Cognitive Impairment And Their Care Partners Using Conversational Agents,"Conversational agents (CAs) such as Google Home or Alexa offer empowering opportunities for dyads composed of older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and their care partners. CAs support coordination and planning between the two, and can amplify the support that the care partner needs to provide. In this study, we observed how ten such dyads interacted with a Google Home over 10 weeks. We logged and analyzed 3,878 total interactions, interviewed the dyads to better understand their experiences, and also surveyed their individual preferences and priorities for automated assistance in the home. We found that CAs empowered both the people who had MCI, and their care partners. We observed that the utility of the CA in the day-to-day lives of users largely depended on how much the care partner scaffolded promising functionality, setting it up and contextualizing it for specific needs and desires."
10.1145/3411764.3445540,”Naked and on Fire”: Examining Player Agency Experiences in Narrative-Focused Gameplay,"Player agency is central to interactive narrative and games. While previous work focuses on analyzing player perception of agency through various lenses and phenomena, like meaningful choice and expectations, it is largely theoretical. Few user studies within games explore how players reason about and judge their own agency within interactive narratives. We present an interview study where participants rated their agency experiences within narrative-focused games and described their reasoning. The analysis suggests that agency perception depends on multiple factors beyond meaningful choice, such as social investment and genre-conventions. Participants described varying preferences and value judgements for different factors, indicating that individual differences have a deep impact on agency perception in narrative-focused gameplay. We discuss the implications of these cognitive variables on design, how they can be leveraged with other factors, and how our findings can help future work enhance and measure player agency, within interactive narrative and beyond."
10.1145/3412370,Finding the Largest Successful Coalition under the Strict Goal Preferences of Agents,"Coalition formation has been a fundamental form of resource cooperation for achieving joint goals in multiagent systems. Most existing studies still focus on the traditional assumption that an agent has to contribute its resources to all the goals, even if the agent is not interested in the goal at all. In this article, a natural extension of the traditional coalitional resource games (CRGs) is studied from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, in which each agent has uncompromising, personalized preferences over goals. Specifically, a new CRGs model with agents’ strict preferences for goals is presented, in which an agent is willing to contribute its resources only to the goals that are in its own interest set. The computational complexity of the basic decision problems surrounding the successful coalition is reinvestigated. The results suggest that these problems in such a strict preference way are complex and intractable. To find the largest successful coalition for possible computation reduction or potential parallel processing, a flow-network–based exhaust algorithm, called FNetEA, is proposed to achieve the optimal solution. Then, to solve the problem more efficiently, a hybrid algorithm, named 2D-HA, is developed to find the approximately optimal solution on the basis of genetic algorithm, two-dimensional (2D) solution representation, and a heuristic for solution repairs. Through extensive experiments, the 2D-HA algorithm exhibits the prominent ability to provide reassurances that the optimal solution could be found within a reasonable period of time, even in a super-large-scale space."
10.1145/3412841.3441942,The interplay of a conversational ontology and AI planning for health dialogue management,"Health dialogue systems are required to respect some special requirements such as predictability and reliability. While knowledge based approaches still seem to be the most appropriate for these systems, the automated generation of reliable policies remains an open problem. This work proposes an approach that integrates a conversational ontology (Convology) and Artificial Intelligence planning with the aim of automating the generation of a dialogue manager capable of handling goal-oriented dialogues for the health domain. The resulting dialogue manager is aimed to be integrated into a suitable architecture that provides the natural language components. We illustrate our approach by describing how it has been implemented into PuffBot, a multi-turn goal-oriented conversational agent for supporting patients affected by asthma."
10.1145/3424953.3426510,Analyzing the socioenactive dimensions of creative learning environments with preschool children,"Several published papers discuss how to encourage creativity in the classroom. An emerging concept is creative learning, which attempts to understand, experiment, and define methodologies and learning environments designed to promote creativity. Enaction theorists, a new thread of cognitive science, understand that cognition and creativity always emerge through real-time interaction with the environment and other agents in that environment. Socioenactive systems are extensions to the enactive system concept, bringing attention to socio-cultural values in the dynamic coupling of the human (through the body senses) and technology. This work aims to explore and understand the creative process of preschool children during their interaction with a tangible programming environment (TaPrEC+mBot) that allows programming of a robot car by arranging wooden blocks. The analysis draws on the physical, digital, and social dimensions of socioenactive systems. The results show that the children felt especially involved through their bodies and engaged in the activity of creating their own programming scenario. They also suggest that the children's reasoning and behavior seem to be connected or influenced by their body movements and their physical, social and digital experience and interaction with the tangible programming environment."
10.1145/3426425.3426942,Behavior trees in action: a study of robotics applications,"Autonomous robots combine a variety of skills to form increasingly complex behaviors called missions. While the skills are often programmed at a relatively low level of abstraction, their coordination is architecturally separated and often expressed in higher-level languages or frameworks. Recently, the language of Behavior Trees gained attention among roboticists for this reason. Originally designed for computer games to model autonomous actors, Behavior Trees offer an extensible tree-based representation of missions. However, even though, several implementations of the language are in use, little is known about its usage and scope in the real world. How do behavior trees relate to traditional languages for describing behavior? How are behavior tree concepts used in applications? What are the benefits of using them?  We present a study of the key language concepts in Behavior Trees and their use in real-world robotic applications. We identify behavior tree languages and compare their semantics to the most well-known behavior modeling languages: state and activity diagrams. We mine open source repositories for robotics applications that use the language and analyze this usage. We find that Behavior Trees are a pragmatic language, not fully specified, allowing projects to extend it even for just one model. Behavior trees clearly resemble the models-at-runtime paradigm. We contribute a dataset of real-world behavior models, hoping to inspire the community to use and further develop this language, associated tools, and analysis techniques."

In instances like these, a planning model of human behavior may greatly help. We present an experimental setup for the development and testing of an Soft Actor Critic (SAC) V2 RL architecture for several different neural architectures for planning models: an autoML optimized LSTM, an OLS, and a baseline model. We present the effects of including a planning model in agent learning within a simulation of the office, currently reporting a limited success with the LSTM."
10.1145/3428300,Koord: a language for programming and verifying distributed robotics application,"A robot’s code needs to sense the environment, control the hardware, and communicate with other robots. Current programming languages do not provide suitable abstractions that are independent of hardware platforms. Currently, developing robot applications requires detailed knowledge of signal processing, control, path planning, network protocols, and various platform-specific details. Further, porting applications across hardware platforms remains tedious. We present Koord—a domain specific language for distributed robotics—which abstracts platform-specific functions for sensing, communication, and low-level control. Koord makes the platform-independent control and coordination code portable and modularly verifiable. Koord raises the level of abstraction in programming by providing distributed shared memory for coordination and port interfaces for sensing and control. We have developed the formal executable semantics of Koord in the K framework. With this symbolic execution engine, we can identify assumptions (proof obligations) needed for gaining high assurance from Koord applications. We illustrate the power of Koord through three applications: formation flight, distributed delivery, and distributed mapping. We also use the three applications to demonstrate how platform-independent proof obligations can be discharged using the Koord Prover while platform-specific proof obligations can be checked by verifying the obligations using physics-based models and hybrid verification tools."

To a certain extent, it represents the overall level of the regional informatization. It is also a data exchange and sharing platform connecting the basic systems of local various medical and health institutions, and it is also the base and carrier to integrate the regional information system. This paper introduces the local regional medical informatization construction, planning architecture, data center construction mode and technical realization methods. Through this project, the informatization level of basic health agencies and all hospitals will have been greatly improved. It can provide more convenient and high-quality medical service for patients, alleviates ""difficulty and expensive"" problem effectively."
10.1145/3434074.3446911,Who Wants to Grant Robots Rights?,"The robot rights debate has thus far proceeded without any reliable data concerning the public opinion about robots and the rights they should have. We have administered an online survey (n = 200) that investigates layman's attitudes towards granting particular rights to robots. Furthermore, we have asked them for what reasons they are willing to grant them those rights. Finally, we have administered general perceptions of robots regarding appearance, capacities, and traits. Results show that rights can be divided in sociopolitical and computing dimensions, and reasons into cognition and compassion dimensions. People generally have a positive view on robot interaction capacities. Attitudes towards robot rights depend on age and experience as well as on the cognitive and affective capacities people believe robots will ever possess. Our results suggest that the robot rights debate stands to benefit greatly from a common understanding of the capacity potentials of future robots."
10.1145/3434490,Discrete-Event Modeling and Simulation of Diffusion Processes in Multiplex Networks,"A variety of phenomena (such as the spread of diseases, pollution in rivers, etc.) can be studied as diffusion processes over networks (i.e., the diffusion of the phenomenon over a set of interconnected entities). This research introduces a method to study such diffusion processes in multiplex dynamic networks. We use a formal Modeling and Simulation methodology (in our case, DEVS, Discrete-Event System Specification). We use DEVS formal models to integrate models defined using Agent-Based Modeling and Network Theory. We present (1) an Architecture to study Diffusion Processes in Multiplex dynamic networks (ADPM) and (2) a systematic Process to define, implement, and simulate diffusion processes over such networks. We show a theoretical definition and a concrete implementation of ADPM. We show how to use ADPM and the process in a case study based on a real nuclear emergency plan; this illustrates the application of the process, the architecture, and the developed software. Different scenarios are studied as Diffusion Processes to demonstrate the usability of ADPM."
10.1145/3444369,Developing Conversational Agents for Use in Criminal Investigations,"The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in environments that involve high risk and high consequence decision-making is severely hampered by critical design issues. These issues include system transparency and brittleness, where transparency relates to (i) the explainability of results and (ii) the ability of a user to inspect and verify system goals and constraints; and brittleness, (iii) the ability of a system to adapt to new user demands. Transparency is a particular concern for criminal intelligence analysis, where there are significant ethical and trust issues that arise when algorithmic and system processes are not adequately understood by a user. This prevents adoption of potentially useful technologies in policing environments. In this article, we present a novel approach to designing a conversational agent (CA) AI system for intelligence analysis that tackles these issues. We discuss the results and implications of three different studies; a Cognitive Task Analysis to understand analyst thinking when retrieving information in an investigation, Emergent Themes Analysis to understand the explanation needs of different system components, and an interactive experiment with a prototype conversational agent. Our prototype conversational agent, named Pan, demonstrates transparency provision and mitigates brittleness by evolving new CA intentions. We encode interactions with the CA with human factors principles for situation recognition and use interactive visual analytics to support analyst reasoning. Our approach enables complex AI systems, such as Pan, to be used in sensitive environments, and our research has broader application than the use case discussed."
10.1145/3448734.3450793,An Efficient RRT-based Framework for Planning Short and Smooth Alige.x Robot Motion,"Autonomous navigation is a crucial technology for the automatic operation of mobile robots, in which path planning is the core part. In a complicated and dynamic environment, planning efficiency is crucial. In this paper, we propose a hybrid path planning scheme for a differentially driven wheeled robot with dynamical constraints by combining global path planning and local hierarchical architectures in a complex dynamic environment. In path planning under the hybrid structure, first, we generate a global path based on the adaptive goal-directed RRT algorithm. This way can achieve Efficiency. Local path planning uses the DWA with PID controller instead of the cost function for real-time motion control. A seamless interface between the global and local path planning mechanisms is designed to contribute to the whole hybrid path planning scheme. Finally, the experimental results on the grid map prove the potency and feasibility of our method."
10.1145/3448734.3450894,Kinematics Analysis of Anti-Terrorism Robot with Rigid-Flexible Parallel Closed Loop Linkage Mechanism,"The flexible linkage and parallel mechanism is gradually introduced to the structural design of various types of the robots. For anti-terrorism robot, this article put forward a kind of rigid-flexible hybrid parallel close looped linkage mechanism. Firstly, the plane rigid-flexible hybrid close looped system model is established. On this basis, dynamic model is established by using Lagrange and assumed mode methods. Finally, the model which has been developed was simulated, and it was compared and analyzed with the rigid system. The results show that the rules of the energy variation of the new model are similar to general rigid system. Therefore it can be applied to the same applicable situation. Under external force, the change curve of kinetic energy of rigid-flexible system is gentler. It has a more significant characteristic of smoothening impact and is more applicative where there is more impact as a result."
10.1145/3449639.3459301,An efficient computational approach for automatic itinerary planning on web servers,"The automatic itinerary planning service requires to generate multiple-day schedules automatically under user-specified POIs and constraints. Knowing as an NP-Hard optimization problem, the task is commonly solved by (meta-)heuristic algorithms such as the genetic algorithms (GAs). However, considering the concurrent requests received by a web server in practice, the time efficiency of the existing itinerary planners can be rather unsatisfactory. To address the issue, this paper proposes a computational approach that hybridizing a GA with the reinforcement learning (RL) technology. The benefit is that we no longer need to re-execute the GA for each new request arrived. Instead, the approach keeps the historical solutions in track and maintains a RL agent to sequentially decide how to handle each new request. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to stably provide high-quality solutions, while greatly reducing the average time overhead of the web server."
10.1145/3452296.3472902,Network planning with deep reinforcement learning,"Network planning is critical to the performance, reliability and cost of web services. This problem is typically formulated as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. Today's practice relies on hand-tuned heuristics from human experts to address the scalability challenge of ILP solvers.In this paper, we propose NeuroPlan, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to solve the network planning problem. This problem involves multi-step decision making and cost minimization, which can be naturally cast as a deep RL problem. We develop two important domain-specific techniques. First, we use a graph neural network (GNN) and a novel domain-specific node-link transformation for state encoding, in order to handle the dynamic nature of the evolving network topology during planning decision making. Second, we leverage a two-stage hybrid approach that first uses deep RL to prune the search space and then uses an ILP solver to find the optimal solution. This approach resembles today's practice, but avoids human experts with an RL agent in the first stage. Evaluation on real topologies and setups from large production networks demonstrates that NeuroPlan scales to large topologies beyond the capability of ILP solvers, and reduces the cost by up to 17\% compared to hand-tuned heuristics."
10.1145/3453892.3461332,Benchmarking Force Control Algorithms,"Force control is nowadays a mature technology and it is becoming more and more common in robotic applications. A specific and significant example are robotic devices for rehabilitation. Despite this, an effective standardized and comprehensive method to assess force control performance does not exist. Defining the performance of a force-controlled system is not a trivial task, and one of the reasons is that performance does not only depend on the dynamics of the robot, but also on the dynamics of the environment, which are usually uncertain and time-varying. Exerting a force on a soft environment is different from exerting a force on a rigid environment. Indeed, the same force-controlled robot can have different force responses in different environments. This paper proposes a methodology to standardize the benchmarking of force control algorithms applied to different actuation architectures and considering a wide set of possible environments and disturbances, defined by the application of interest."
10.1145/3457682.3457759,Multi-Perspective Reasoning Transformers,"Machine Reading Comprehension is defined as the ability of machines to read and understand unstructured text and answer questions about it. It is considered as a challenging task with wide range of enterprise applications. Wide range of natural language understanding and reasoning tasks are found embedded within machine reading comprehension datasets. This requires effective models with robust relational reasoning capabilities to answer complex questions. Reasoning in natural language is a long-term machine-learning goal and is critically needed for building intelligent agents. However, most papers heavily depend on underlying language modeling and thus pay little to no attention on creating effective reasoning models. This paper proposes a modified transformer architecture that effectively combines soft and hard attention to create multi-perspective reasoning model capable of tackling wide range of reasoning tasks. An attention mechanism that highlights the relational significance of input signals is considered as well. The result from this study shows performance gain as compared to its counterpart the transformer network on bAbI dataset, a natural language reasoning tasks."
10.1145/3459104.3459125,Development of a Hybrid Control Algorithm Based on Neural Networks for Mobile Autonomous Robot Navigation,"A control algorithm based on adaptive neural networks is developed to control the navigation of a mobile autonomous ground-based explorer robot. A simulation was performed in the Matlab program to verify the operation of the algorithm, where the set of proximity sensors used by the robot for the detection and evasion of obstacles was simulated.The algorithm was developed using three neural network architectures: Adaline-type linear adaptive network, Perceptron neural network, and Feedforward neural network. The mathematical study of each of the adaptive neural network architectures proposed for the recognition of training patterns, corresponding to wall following patterns was carried out; their comparison was made and based on the results of the simulation, the one that showed the best output responses was selected to form part of the algorithm.This algorithm is in charged of the main tasks of obstacle avoidance and the target searching, generating as control outputs: the angle of rotation of the robot concerning its current position and its forward speed, to solve the problem of high difficulty concave obstacles encountered in the robot's path to the target. This is a hybrid algorithm, made up of a local path planning algorithm, in charge of obstacle wall fallowing and a global path planning algorithm, in charge of finding the final objective.This work focused on solving the problem of evasion of high difficulty concave obstacles, formed by curves in the form of a loop, also called dead-end traps, in which a situation of local minimum is presented. In this work different types of obstacles were simulated, being able to create almost any shape; the algorithm was tested with obstacles created from arrays of bars or lines forming simple corners, with obstacles such as U-shaped, snail-shaped, labyrinth-shaped, among other complicated shapes.The developed algorithm autonomously generates an obstacle-free navigation path, with a speed control of the robot, during the entire movement until reaching the final target.Besides, the simulation shows that the designed algorithm works adequately to solve the problem of concave obstacles, and compared with results of other mobile robot navigation techniques such as potential fields, diffuse controller-based techniques, and techniques based on rule learning (pure neural network); that in general, they present great limitations to solve the type of problem posed, difficult concave-type obstacles, remaining stuck in local minima or entering into infinite cycles with no exit, without reaching the final target; therefore, the robustness of the developed algorithm is shown."
10.1145/3459996,Tactile Perception for Teleoperated Robotic Exploration within Granular Media,"The sense of touch is essential for locating buried objects when vision-based approaches are limited. We present an approach for tactile perception when sensorized robot fingertips are used to directly interact with granular media particles in teleoperated systems. We evaluate the effects of linear and nonlinear classifier model architectures and three tactile sensor modalities (vibration, internal fluid pressure, fingerpad deformation) on the accuracy of estimates of fingertip contact state. We propose an architecture called the Sparse-Fusion Recurrent Neural Network (SF-RNN) in which sparse features are autonomously extracted prior to fusing multimodal tactile data in a fully connected RNN input layer. The multimodal SF-RNN model achieved 98.7\% test accuracy and was robust to modest variations in granular media type and particle size, fingertip orientation, fingertip speed, and object location. Fingerpad deformation was the most informative modality for haptic exploration within granular media while vibration and internal fluid pressure provided additional information with appropriate signal processing. We introduce a real-time visualization of tactile percepts for remote exploration by constructing a belief map that combines probabilistic contact state estimates and fingertip location. The belief map visualizes the probability of an object being buried in the search region and could be used for planning."
10.1145/3460210.3493585,Cutting Events: Towards Autonomous Plan Adaption by Robotic Agents through Image-Schematic Event Segmentation,"Autonomous robots struggle with plan adaption in uncertain and changing environments. Although modern robots can make popcorn and pancakes, they are incapable of performing such tasks in unknown settings and unable to adapt action plans if ingredients or tools are missing. Humans are continuously aware of their surroundings. For robotic agents, real-time state updating is time-consuming and other methods for failure handling are required. Taking inspiration from human cognition, we propose a plan adaption method based on event segmentation of the image-schematic states of subtasks within action descriptors. For this, we reuse action plans of the robotic architecture CRAM and ontologically model the involved objects and image-schematic states of the action descriptor cutting. Our evaluation uses a robot simulation of the task of cutting bread and demonstrates that the system can reason about possible solutions to unexpected failures regarding tool use."
10.1145/3461615.3485413,Get Together in the Middle-earth: a First Step Towards Hybrid Intelligence Systems,"In the last decade, the number of computer systems using AI has increased dramatically. To date, indeed, AI is present in almost all the aspects of the human everyday life. This resulted in the attempt of scholars in Computer Science to endow machines with human-like socio-cognitive skills and/or human-like embodiment to try to improve interactions. Such an approach, however, highlights several crucial issues related to the substantial differences between fine-grained human skills and what machines can do and learn. So, although being expensive and sophisticated tools, machines tend to be “idiots savants”. Hybrid Intelligence (HI) is aimed to tackle this issue by proposing, as Akata and colleagues say, “systems that operate as mixed teams, where humans and machines cooperate synergistically, proactively, and purposefully to achieve shared goals”. To our knowledge, however, HI is at a very early exploratory stage, and few concrete solutions to deal with it exist. In this position paper we introduce and briefly describe “Middle-Earth”, a conceptual and experimental ground to study HI. Moreover, we present a first prototype of a software platform based on immersive VR environments, on which we plan to carry out in the future the first pioneering experiments on teams of humans and/or AI-driven agents getting together in Middle Earth to perform collaborative tasks."
10.1145/3461702.3462515,A Multi-Agent Approach to Combine Reasoning and Learning for an Ethical Behavior,"The recent field of Machine Ethics is experiencing rapid growth to answer the societal need for Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms imbued with ethical considerations, such as benevolence toward human users and actors. Several approaches already exist for this purpose, mostly either by reasoning over a set of predefined ethical principles (Top-Down), or by learning new principles (Bottom-Up). While both methods have their own advantages and drawbacks, only few works have explored hybrid approaches, such as using symbolic rules to guide the learning process for instance, combining the advantages of each. This paper draws upon existing works to propose a novel hybrid method using symbolic judging agents to evaluate the ethics of learning agents' behaviors, and accordingly improve their ability to ethically behave in dynamic multi-agent environments. Multiple benefits ensue from this separation between judging and learning agents: agents can evolve (or be updated by human designers) separately, benefiting from co-construction processes; judging agents can act as accessible proxies for non-expert human stakeholders or regulators; and finally, multiple points of view (one per judging agent) can be adopted to judge the behavior of the same agent, which produces a richer feedback. Our proposed approach is applied to an energy distribution problem, in the context of a Smart Grid simulator, with continuous and multi-dimensional states and actions. The experiments and results show the ability of learning agents to correctly adapt their behaviors to comply with the judging agents' rules, including when rules evolve over time."
10.1145/3461702.3462520,Alienation in the AI-Driven Workplace,"This paper asks whether explanations of one's workplace and economic institutions are valuable in and of themselves. In doing so, it departs from much of the explainability literature in law, computer science, philosophy, and the social sciences, which examine the instrumental values that explainable AI has: explainable systems increase accountability and user trust, or reduce the risk of harm due to increased robustness. Think, however, of how you might feel if you went to your local administrative agency to apply for some benefit, or you were handed down a decision by a judge in a court. Let's stipulate that you know that the decision was just, even though neither the civil servant nor the judge explain to you why the decision was made, and you don't know the relevant rules; you just brought all the information you had about yourself, and hoped for the best. Is such a decision process defective? I argue that such a decision process is defective because it prevents individuals from accessing the normative explanations that are necessary to form an appropriate practical orientation towards their social world. A practical orientation is a reflective stance towards one's social world, which is expressed in one's actions and draws on one's cognitive architecture that allows one to navigate the various social practices and institutions. A practical orientation can range from rejection to silent endorsement, and is the sort of attitude for which there are the right kind of reasons, based in the world's normative character. It also determines how one fills out one's role obligations, and, more broadly, guides one's actions in the relevant institution: a teacher in the American South during the time of enforced racial segregation, for example, might choose where to teach on the basis of her rejection of the segregation of education. To form an appropriate practical orientation, one must have an understanding of the social world's normative character, which required a normative explanation And, since we spend so much of our lives at work and are constrained by economic institutions, we must understand their structure and how they function."
10.1145/3469127,Struggling to Keep Tabs on Capstone Projects: A Chatbot to Tackle Student Procrastination,"Capstone projects usually represent the most significant academic endeavor with which students have been involved. Time management tends to be one of the hurdles. On top, University students are prone to procrastinatory behavior. Inexperience and procrastination team up for students failing to meet deadlines. Supervisors strive to help. Yet heavy workloads frequently prevent tutors from continuous involvement. This article looks into the extent to which conversational agents (a.k.a. chatbots) can tackle procrastination in single-student capstone projects. Specifically, chatbot enablers put in play include (1) alerts, (2) advice, (3) automatic rescheduling, (4) motivational messages, and (5) reference to previous capstone projects. Informed by Cognitive Behavioural Theory, these enablers are framed within the three phases involved in self-regulation misalignment: pre-actional, actional, and post-actional. To motivate this research, we first analyzed 77 capstone-project reports. We found that students’ Gantt charts (1) fail to acknowledge review meetings (70\%) and milestones (100\%) and (2) suffer deviations from the initial planned effort (16.28\%). On these grounds, we develop GanttBot, a Telegram chatbot that is configured from the student’s Gantt diagram. GanttBot reminds students about close landmarks, it informs tutors when intervention might be required, and it learns from previous projects about common pitfalls, advising students accordingly. For evaluation purposes, course 17/18 acts as the control group ( N=28 ) while course 18/19 acts as the treatment group ( N=25  students). Using “overdue days” as the proxy for procrastination, results indicate that course 17/18 accounted for an average of 19 days of delay (SD = 5), whereas these days go down to 10 for the intervention group in course 18/19 (SD = 4). GanttBot is available for public usage as a Telegram chatbot."
10.1145/3469213.3470712,Design and Realization of Distance Intelligent Learning System Based on Bayesian Network Training,"Modern long-distance teaching utilizes the advantages of Internet information technology, making it not only comparable to traditional teaching in certain typical indicators, but also able to integrate with relevant educational technology, and develop new teaching models that cannot be supported by traditional teaching environments. However, judging from the current situation, most of the distance teaching systems have shortcomings in design. They only digitize the existing teaching models and existing teaching materials and move them to the Internet, which makes the system lacks intelligence and adaptability. It is difficult to provide personalized learning guidance for students' learning differences, and the quality of distance teaching cannot be well guaranteed. This paper proposes an intelligent teaching model based on Bayesian network and multi-agent technology. The teaching model can be different from person to person to formulate and implement guidance strategies, actively collect the most interesting information for learners through the intelligent agent proxy server, and automatically generate various questions and exercises. At the same time, the model uses agent communication protocol to process information through reasonable planning and adjustment of learning content and progress, and allows users to browse. The system can predict user needs, actively formulate learning plans, adjust learning progress, and diagnose learning progress. Problems and errors make them more in line with the learner's knowledge base and cognitive characteristics. Therefore, the teaching model has a certain pertinence and forward-looking."
10.1145/3469410.3469419,Plant(e)tecture: Towards a Multispecies Media Architecture Framework for amplifying Plant Agencies,"More-than-human media architecture is gaining increased attention as a response to the planet's environmental emergency and in turn allowing us to envision a more desirable future compared to tech-utopian smart cities. New types of digital technologies have emerged into the human mindscape, and with that a new potential for bridging human understanding and multispecies geographies. Emphasising the agency of plants, this paper attempts to answer the following research questions: how can twenty-first-century media technologies, such as media architecture, be used to better incorporate plant/flora perspectives? This paper begins by providing a review of multispecies ontology, exploration of plant agency and how media architecture can visualise and amplify plant agency based on Whitehead's Process Philosophy, Mark Hansen's Feed-Forward concept and Feenberg's technical agency framework. Hortum Machina B, terra0, and Elowan are explored as three examples of Plant(e)tecture where the multispecies actors “plants'' are coupled with technologies and analysed for agency and autonomy. Synthesising the three case studies, the paper discusses the role of media architecture in (i) enabling plant agency; (ii) engaging multispecies actors in autonomous decision-making, and; (iii) the creation of technology to amplify the agency of plants in a design process that transcends human sensibilities. The paper closes on the prospect of the multispecies-techno agency framework to enable human designers, makers, decision-makers and thinkers to move beyond human-centric determinism prevalent in media architecture. The framework offers new ways of thinking of the purpose of technical agency in multispecies assemblages."
10.1145/3472813.3473197,"The Contemporary Issues in Medico-Social, Sanitary Protection of Mother and Child; Health Care Facilities, Awareness and Management of Primary Health Care Services in Nigeria","This study is focused on contemporaneous longer-term acute issues for mother child under five. It is an expository work targeted to uncover lack of access to Primary Health Care Services (PHCS) which has consistently posed serious health risks in Nigerian society, especially in rural areas, where health facilities are largely inadequate or absent in extreme cases. COVID-19 has played an important role in disclosing lapses of health facilities in most countries around the world and Nigeria is not an exception. Therefore, it takes cognizance of the mother and child health, pre and post antenatal well-being. Previous studies examination indicated that about one in every six children dies before age five in Nigeria. This suggests that improved access to adequate health care holds great potential for improved child survival. However, there has not been an enough systematic attempt to examine the effects of these barriers to health care on under-five mortality in Nigerian rural areas. This study is designed to address this knowledge gap. Method and materials: Online survey monkey tool (OSMT) aims to collect data and measure accuracy performance for proper feedback was employed. A structured questionnaire was used to send across 107 pregnant women in some rural areas in Nigeria for a period of one month and 2 weeks and they responded through emails, Facebook etc. due to Covid-19 protocol and restrictions. A total of 67 persons responded. Their feedback was processed, analyzed and presented in graphics. Objective: To ascertain the health situation of mother and child in Nigerian rural communities and the other prevalence factors influencing access to primary health care services. Results and discussion- We found 95.52\% respondents align with the fact that health of the mothers and children is a public health priority, 79.10\% agreed that progress in newborn health does not require expansive technology. 83.82\% subscribed to the idea that an urgent need is required t develop effective ways to organizing continuity of care during those first weeks after birth etc. Conclusion: Findings of this study stressed the need for improved access to adequate health care in rural areas through the elimination of barriers to access and education awareness. This study would enable health agencies and planners in the country to achieve a significant reduction in childhood and mother mortality in the long run."
10.1145/3477314.3507270,Rating consistency is consistently underrated: an exploratory analysis of movie-tag rating inconsistency,"Content-based and hybrid recommender systems rely on item-tag ratings to make recommendations. An example of an item-tag rating is the degree to which the tag ""comedy"" applies to the movie ""Back to the Future (1985)"". Ratings are often generated by human annotators who can be inconsistent with one another. However, many recommender systems take item-tag ratings at face value, assuming them all to be equally valid. In this paper, we investigate the inconsistency of item-tag ratings together with contextual factors that could affect consistency in the movie domain. We conducted semi-structured interviews to identify potential reasons for rating inconsistency. Next, we used these reasons to design a survey, which we ran on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We collected 6,070 ratings from 665 annotators across 142 movies and 80 tags. Our analysis shows that ~45\% of ratings are inconsistent with the mode rating for a given movie-tag pair. We found that the single most important factor for rating inconsistency is the annotator's perceived ease of rating, suggesting that annotators are at least tacitly aware of the quality of their own ratings. We also found that subjective tags (e.g. ""funny"", ""boring"") are more inconsistent than objective tags (e.g. ""robots"", ""aliens""), and are associated with lower tag familiarity and lower perceived ease of rating."

A safe range for pure tensile load has been estimated using FEM simulation to confirm usability in prototyping. Three modules have been designed to produce active, passive, and joint locking functionalities in the revolute joints and the fourth connectivity module helps to achieve the connectivity in between revolute joints of different linkages. It has been shown by developing the prototype for two different complex planer hybrid manipulators as examples, that these modules work as tools for the designer to design a customized manipulator. CAD modelling has been used for preparing a complete manipulator structure which, using AM, can be given the physical form.In the design and manufacturing of robotic manipulators, incorporating modular libraries makes the design customizable as well as makes the process easier. With this approach, the user follows a drag and drop approach to customize a design using an already available set of modular components fulfilling different purposes. Further work will demonstrate the technique by preparing models some randomly selected linkages based upon the designed modules."
10.1145/3481585,"A Cloud-based Robot System for Long-term Interaction: Principles, Implementation, Lessons Learned","Making the transition to long-term interaction with social-robot systems has been identified as one of the main challenges in human-robot interaction. This article identifies four design principles to address this challenge and applies them in a real-world implementation: cloud-based robot control, a modular design, one common knowledge base for all applications, and hybrid artificial intelligence for decision making and reasoning. The control architecture for this robot includes a common Knowledge-base (ontologies), Data-base, “Hybrid Artificial Brain” (dialogue manager, action selection and explainable AI), Activities Centre (Timeline, Quiz, Break and Sort, Memory, Tip of the Day,  ( ldots  ) ), Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA, i.e., robot and avatar), and Dashboards (for authoring and monitoring the interaction). Further, the ECA is integrated with an expandable set of (mobile) health applications. The resulting system is a Personal Assistant for a healthy Lifestyle (PAL), which supports diabetic children with self-management and educates them on health-related issues (48 children, aged 6–14, recruited via hospitals in the Netherlands and in Italy). It is capable of autonomous interaction “in the wild” for prolonged periods of time without the need for a “Wizard-of-Oz” (up until 6 months online). PAL is an exemplary system that provides personalised, stable and diverse, long-term human-robot interaction."
10.1145/3485114.3485122,The new analog: A protocol for linking design and construction intent with algorithmic planning for robotic assembly of complex structures,"Construction robotics are increasingly popular in the architectural fabrication community due to their accuracy and flexibility. Because of their high degree of motion freedom, these tools are able to assemble complex structures with irregular designs, which advances architectural aesthetics and structural performance. However, automated task and motion planning (TAMP) for a robot to assemble non-repetitive objects can be challenging due to (1) a non-repetitive assembly pattern (2) the need for a continuous robotic motion throughout a sequence of movement (3) a congested construction scene and (4) occasional robot configuration constraints due to taught positions. Recent work has already begun to address these challenges for repetitive assembly processes, where the robot repeats a pattern of primitive behaviors (e.g. brick stacking or spatial extrusion). Yet, there are many assembly processes that can benefit from a non-repetitive pattern. For example, processes can change tools on an element-by-element level to accommodate a wider range of geometry. Our work is motivated by the necessity of robotic modeling and planning for a recently published timber assembly process which utilizes distributed robotic clamps to press together interlocking joints. In addition to pick-and-place operations, the robot needs to move numerous tools within the construction scene, similar to a tool-change operation. In order to facilitate an agile process for architectural design, construction process design, and TAMP, we introduce a flowchart-based specification language which allows various designers to describe their design and construction intent and knowledge. A compiler can then translate the assembly description, sequence, process flowchart, and robotic setup into a plan skeleton. Additionally, we present a linear and a non-linear solving algorithm that can solve the plan skeleton for a full sequence of robot motions. This algorithm can be customized to take into account designer intuition, which can speed up the planning process. We provide a comparison of the two algorithms using the timber assembly process as our case study. We validate our results by robotically executing and constructing a large-scale real-world timber structure. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of our flowchart by showing how custom assembly actions are modeled in our case study. We also demonstrate how other recently published robotic assembly processes can be formulated using our flowcharts to demonstrate generalizability."
10.1145/3488241,Stop Ignoring Me! On Fighting the Trivialization of Social Robots in Public Spaces,"Service and social robot in public scenarios will face various tasks in future applications, such as guiding people or admonishing them to provide assistance or convey social norms. Robots in public spaces might also incorporate roles of authority figures who might admonish people (e.g., security or guard robots). However, recent investigations showed that people ignore the admonishment of robots. Thus, in this work, we are looking at the reasons why people might ignore robots based on the Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT). We present the results of two consecutive field observations where a robot admonishes participants (i.e., pedestrians in a shopping mall) and requests them to stop using a smartphone while walking, which is considered an unmoral behavior. In the first field observation, we approached 160 participants over four days and conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 of them. Approximately half of the people ignored the robot, and half of them followed the instructions. Our interview results show that people who ignore the robot indeed use trivialization as a cognitive dissonance reduction strategy to justify ignoring the robot. Based on our analysis of the results, we developed a counter-trivialization strategy that anticipates this dissonance reduction strategy. We admonished 167 participants in our second field observation over four days, and our results show that significantly fewer people ignore the instructions of the robot when the robot uses a counter-trivialization strategy."
10.1145/3491102.3501992,Rediscovering Affordance: A Reinforcement Learning Perspective,"Affordance refers to the perception of possible actions allowed by an object. Despite its relevance to human–computer interaction, no existing theory explains the mechanisms that underpin affordance-formation; that is, how affordances are discovered and adapted via interaction. We propose an integrative theory of affordance-formation based on the theory of reinforcement learning in cognitive sciences. The key assumption is that users learn to associate promising motor actions to percepts via experience when reinforcement signals (success/failure) are present. They also learn to categorize actions (e.g., “rotating” a dial), giving them the ability to name and reason about affordance. Upon encountering novel widgets, their ability to generalize these actions determines their ability to perceive affordances. We implement this theory in a virtual robot model, which demonstrates human-like adaptation of affordance in interactive widgets tasks. While its predictions align with trends in human data, humans are able to adapt affordances faster, suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms."

Aiming at the problem that the amplitude of angular velocity and angular acceleration of 3-5-3 hybrid polynomial interpolation algorithm is too high, a 3-3-5 hybrid polynomial interpolation trajectory planning method is proposed. Firstly, the D-H (Denavit-Hartenberg) model of the rail inspection robot is used to compute its kinematics equation. Secondly, according to the constraints of motion curve (angle, angular velocity, angular acceleration continuous), kinematics constraints are obtained and interpolation points are determined. Thirdly, the coefficient expression of the hybrid polynomial interpolation algorithm is solved by substituting kinematics constraints and interpolation points into the formula of the 3-3-5 hybrid polynomial interpolation algorithm. Finally, the 3-3-5 hybrid polynomial interpolation algorithm is simulated in MATLAB. The results show that the 3-3-5 hybrid polynomial interpolation algorithm can effectively reduce the amplitude of the angular velocity and angular acceleration, reduce the jerk of the motor, and improve the overall motion performance of the inspection robot."
10.1145/3503161.3547886,Dilated Context Integrated Network with Cross-Modal Consensus for Temporal Emotion Localization in Videos,"Understanding human emotions is a crucial ability for intelligent robots to provide better human-robot interactions. The existing works are limited to trimmed video-level emotion classification, failing to locate the temporal window corresponding to the emotion. In this paper, we introduce a new task, named Temporal Emotion Localization in videos (TEL), which aims to detect human emotions and localize their corresponding temporal boundaries in untrimmed videos with aligned subtitles. TEL presents three unique challenges compared to temporal action localization: 1) The emotions have extremely varied temporal dynamics; 2) The emotion cues are embedded in both appearances and complex plots; 3) The fine-grained temporal annotations are complicated and labor-intensive. To address the first two challenges, we propose a novel dilated context integrated network with a coarse-fine two-stream architecture. The coarse stream captures varied temporal dynamics by modeling multi-granularity temporal contexts. The fine stream achieves complex plots understanding by reasoning the dependency between the multi-granularity temporal contexts from the coarse stream and adaptively integrates them into fine-grained video segment features. To address the third challenge, we introduce a cross-modal consensus learning paradigm, which leverages the inherent semantic consensus between the aligned video and subtitle to achieve weakly-supervised learning. We contribute a new testing set with 3,000 manually-annotated temporal boundaries so that future research on the TEL problem can be quantitatively evaluated. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our approach on temporal emotion localization. The repository of this work is at https://github.com/YYJMJC/TemporalEmotion-Localization-in-Videos."
10.1145/3503161.3548281,Target-Driven Structured Transformer Planner for Vision-Language Navigation,"Vision-language navigation is the task of directing an embodied agent to navigate in 3D scenes with natural language instructions. For the agent, inferring the long-term navigation target from visual-linguistic clues is crucial for reliable path planning, which, however, has rarely been studied before in literature. In this article, we propose a Target-Driven Structured Transformer Planner (TD-STP) for long-horizon goal-guided and room layout-aware navigation. Specifically, we devise an Imaginary Scene Tokenization mechanism for explicit estimation of the long-term target (even located in unexplored environments). In addition, we design a Structured Transformer Planner which elegantly incorporates the explored room layout into a neural attention architecture for structured and global planning. Experimental results demonstrate that our TD-STP substantially improves previous best methods' success rate by 2\% and 5\% on the test set of R2R and REVERIE benchmarks, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/YushengZhao/TD-STP."
10.1145/3503510,A Workflow Architecture for Cloud-based Distributed Simulation,"Distributed Simulation has still to be adopted significantly by the wider simulation community. Reasons for this might be that distributed simulation applications are difficult to develop and access to multiple computing resources are required. Cloud computing offers low-cost on-demand computing resources. Developing applications that can use cloud computing can be also complex, particularly those that can run on different clouds. Cloud-based Distributed Simulation (CBDS) is potentially attractive, as it may solve the computing resources issue as well as other cloud benefits, such as convenient network access. However, as possibly shown by the lack of sustainable approaches in the literature, the combination of cloud and distributed simulation may be far too complex to develop a general approach. E-Infrastructures have emerged as large-scale distributed systems that support high-performance computing in various scientific fields. Workflow Management Systems (WMS) have been created to simplify the use of these e-Infrastructures. There are many examples of where both technologies have been extended to use cloud computing. This article therefore presents our investigation into the potential of using these technologies for CBDS in the above context and the WORkflow architecture for cLoud-based Distributed Simulation (WORLDS), our contribution to CBDS. We present an implementation of WORLDS using the CloudSME Simulation Platform that combines the WS-PGRADE/gUSE WMS with the CloudBroker Platform as a Service. The approach is demonstrated with a case study using an agent-based distributed simulation of an Emergency Medical Service in REPAST and the Portico HLA RTI on the Amazon EC2 cloud."
10.1145/3503795,Enabling Morally Sensitive Robotic Clarification Requests,"The design of current natural language-oriented robot architectures enables certain architectural components to circumvent moral reasoning capabilities. One example of this is reflexive generation of clarification requests as soon as referential ambiguity is detected in a human utterance. As shown in previous research, this can lead robots to (1) miscommunicate their moral dispositions and (2) weaken human perception or application of moral norms within their current context. We present a solution to these problems by performing moral reasoning on each potential disambiguation of an ambiguous human utterance and responding accordingly, rather than immediately and naively requesting clarification. We implement our solution in the Distributed Integrated Cognition Affect and Reflection robot architecture, which, to our knowledge, is the only current robot architecture with both moral reasoning and clarification request generation capabilities. We then evaluate our method with a human subjects experiment, the results of which indicate that our approach successfully ameliorates the two identified concerns."

Adequate knowledge of the atmospheric temperature of an environment is therefore essential for radio wave propagation planning. In this study, thirty-four (34)-year (1981-2014) atmospheric temperature data of 10 selected weather stations across the climatic zones of Nigeria, obtained from the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET) through the data bank of the West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adaptive Land Use (WASCAL) of the Federal University of Technology Minna, Nigeria was used in Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the prediction of mean monthly atmospheric temperature. The ANN architecture comprised of 2 inputs (the climatic zones and the corresponding month for the mean monthly atmospheric temperature), 1 hidden layer and 1 output (atmospheric temperature). Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was used with 9 different pairs of activation functions formed from 3 activation functions (logsig, purelin and tansig). The number of neurons in the hidden layer was varied from 33-39 with an increasing steps of 2 (33, 35, 37 and 39). The network architecture of 2-37-1 (2 inputs, 37 neurons in the hidden layer and 1 output), with tansig/tansig pair of activation functions had the least mean square error value of 2.2280, and was used for the prediction process. The computed correlation values for measured and predicted atmospheric temperature ranged from 0.9733 to 0.8787, depicting strong positive correlation and good accuracy of the developed model. Comparisons of the measured and the ANN predicted atmospheric temperature across selected stations in the climatic zones of Nigeria, showed that the developed model can effectively predict mean monthly atmospheric temperature, using month and climatic zone as input parameters."
10.1145/3510822,FAtiMA Toolkit: Toward an Accessible Tool for the Development of Socio-emotional Agents,"More than a decade has passed since the development of FearNot!, an application designed to help children deal with bullying through role-playing with virtual characters. It was also the application that led to the creation of FAtiMA, an affective agent architecture for creating autonomous characters that can evoke empathic responses. In this article, we describe the FAtiMA Toolkit, a collection of open-source tools that is designed to help researchers, game developers, and roboticists incorporate a computational model of emotion and decision-making in their work. The toolkit was developed with the goal of making FAtiMA more accessible, easier to incorporate into different projects, and more flexible in its capabilities for human-agent interaction, based upon the experience gathered over the years across different virtual environments and human-robot interaction scenarios. As a result, this work makes several different contributions to the field of Agent-Based Architectures. More precisely, the FAtiMA Toolkit’s library-based design allows developers to easily integrate it with other frameworks, its meta-cognitive model affords different internal reasoners and affective components, and its explicit dialogue structure gives control to the author even within highly complex scenarios. To demonstrate the use of the FAtiMA Toolkit, several different use cases where the toolkit was successfully applied are described and discussed."
10.1145/3512290.3528728,A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with new reproduction and decomposition mechanisms for the multi-point dynamic aggregation problem,"An emerging optimisation problem from real-world applications, named the multi-point dynamic aggregation (MPDA) problem, has become an active research of the multi-robot system. This paper focuses on a multi-objective MPDA (MO-MPDA) problem which is to design execution plans of robots for minimising the cost of used robots and maximising the efficiency of task execution. The MOMPDA problem has the issues of conflicting objectives, redundant representation, and variable-length encoding, posing extra challenges to address the MO-MPDA problem effectively. Combining the ∊-constraint method and decomposition mechanisms, a novel multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm selects the efficiency objective as the main objective and converts the cost objective as constraints. Thus, the multi-objective problem is decomposed into a series of scalar constrained optimisation subproblems by assigning each subproblem with an upper bound constraint. All the subproblems are optimised and evolved simultaneously with the transferring knowledge from other sub-problems to solve the MO-MPDA problem parallelly and efficiently. Besides, considering the characteristics of parent individuals, this paper designs a hybrid reproduction mechanism to transmit effective information to offspring individuals for tackling the encoding redundancy and varying-length. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of most-used metrics."

Within CSCW, there has been an interest in understanding how individuals seek and share support on social media and in online communities. However, less attention has been paid to how collaboration as an aspect of self-management of depression unfolds in people's daily lives. In this paper, we explore the collaborative self-management work of 28 individuals managing depression who live in the United States. Data collection included remote semi-structured interviews with an associated cognitive mapping exercise. Our findings describe who participants turn to for day-to-day collaborative support, how collaborative activities are enacted (across both mood-focused and preventative support practices), and where these often technology-mediated interactions occur across text, phone, video, and picture-based channels. We discuss collaborative self-management in the depression support context, including key characteristics: agency, reciprocity, time, and interaction. We also present a four-step model of how the process occurs over time (awareness, planning, interaction, and reflection). We conclude by discussing how technology ecosystems support individuals' collaborative self-management."
10.1145/3512943,Human-AI Collaboration for UX Evaluation: Effects of Explanation and Synchronization,"Analyzing usability test videos is arduous. Although recent research showed the promise of AI in assisting with such tasks, it remains largely unknown how AI should be designed to facilitate effective collaboration between user experience (UX) evaluators and AI. Inspired by the concepts of agency and work context in human and AI collaboration literature, we studied two corresponding design factors for AI-assisted UX evaluation: explanations and synchronization. Explanations allow AI to further inform humans how it identifies UX problems from a usability test session; synchronization refers to the two ways humans and AI collaborate: synchronously and asynchronously. We iteratively designed a tool-AI Assistant-with four versions of UIs corresponding to the two levels of explanations (with/without) and synchronization (sync/async). By adopting a hybrid wizard-of-oz approach to simulating an AI with reasonable performance, we conducted a mixed-method study with 24 UX evaluators identifying UX problems from usability test videos using AI Assistant. Our quantitative and qualitative results show that AI with explanations, regardless of being presented synchronously or asynchronously, provided better support for UX evaluators' analysis and was perceived more positively; when without explanations, synchronous AI better improved UX evaluators' performance and engagement compared to the asynchronous AI. Lastly, we present the design implications for AI-assisted UX evaluation and facilitating more effective human-AI collaboration."
10.1145/3513091,Assured Mission Adaptation of UAVs,"The design of systems that can change their behaviour to account for scenarios that were not foreseen at design time remains an open challenge. In this article, we propose an approach for adaptation of mobile robot missions that is not constrained to a predefined set of mission evolutions. We implement an adaptive software architecture and show how controller synthesis can be used both to guarantee correct transitioning from the old to the new mission goals with runtime architectural reconfiguration to include new software actuators and sensors if necessary. The architecture brings together architectural concepts that are commonplace in robotics such as temporal planning, discrete, hybrid and continuous control layers together with architectural concepts from adaptive systems such as runtime models and runtime synthesis. We validate the architecture flying several missions taken from the robotic literature for different real and simulated UAVs."
10.1145/3514094.3534182,Piecemeal Knowledge Acquisition for Computational Normative Reasoning,"We present a hybrid approach to knowledge acquisition and representation for machine ethics---or more generally, computational normative reasoning. Building on recent research in artificial intelligence and law, our approach is modeled on the familiar practice of decision-making under precedential constraint in the common law. We first provide a formal characterization of this practice, showing how a body of normative information can be constructed in a way that is piecemeal, distributed, and responsive to particular circumstances. We then discuss two possible applications: first, a robot childminder, and second, moral judgment in a bioethical domain."
10.1145/3514254,MetaCogs: Mitigating Executive Dysfunction via Agent-based Modeling for Metacognitive Strategy Development,"Executive functions (EF) are a collection of cognitive domains governing task initiation, motor planning, attention, and goal-oriented action. Difficulties with EF have marked impacts on adaptive living skills, learning outcomes, and quality of life for people with cognitive and psychosocial disabilities, as well as the broader population. While there is considerable research interest in EF training intervention for disabled populations, very few studies explore metacognitive intervention for people with cognitive disabilities. Metacognition comprises conscious beliefs and strategies around task management and goal setting. Metacognitive awareness has been shown to mediate the effects of executive function on self-regulated learning. Metacognitive interventions have also shown promise in general education, military training, and medical practice. We present a virtual reality experience deploying agent-based modeling to support explicit metacognitive strategy instruction for undergraduate students of all neurotypes. Our results support that explicit instructional material explaining executive function and metacognition in relation to problem-solving experiences influenced participant self-concept and awareness of personal traits and cognitive processes."

We present a GUI-driven, and efficient Genetic Programming (GP) system for this purpose. Our system, ABL-Unity3D, addresses challenges entailed in co-opting Unity3D: making the simulator serve agent learning rather than humans playing a game, lowering fitness evaluation time to make learning computationally feasible, and interfacing GP with an AI Planner to support hybrid algorithms that could improve performance. We achieve this through development of a GUI using the Unity3D editor's programmable interface, and performance optimizations. These optimizations result in at least a 3x speed up. We describe ABL-Unity3D by explaining how to use it for an example experiment using GP and AI Planning."

Such systems are characterized by close interactions, or even collaborations, between hardware and machinery on the one hand, and humans on the other. Furthermore, as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in general and robotic applications in particular typically operate in an emergent environment, unanticipated events may occur during their operation, making the need for runtime monitoring support a crucial yet often time-consuming task. Runtime monitoring typically requires establishing support for collecting data, aggregating and transporting the data to a monitoring framework for persistence and further processing, and finally, performing checks of functional and non-functional properties. In this paper, we present our initial efforts towards a flexible monitoring framework for ROS-based systems. We report on challenges for establishing runtime monitoring support and present our preliminary architecture that aims to significantly reduce the setup and maintenance effort when creating monitors and establishing constraint checks."

10.1145/3526109,Human-Robot Scaffolding: An Architecture to Foster Problem-solving Skills,"In order to give assertive support, robots need to understand the cognitive and emotional characteristics of learners while in the learning process. Also, if the task involves handling capacity, robots must have similar skills. Three concepts were explored to control the cognitive and emotional robot’s behavior: the psychological flow theory, the scaffolding pedagogic strategy, and the multiagents-software paradigm. Based on these concepts, the Human-Robot Scaffolding architecture was designed. It is divided into five blocks. First, the sensory block recognizes body gestures, speech, and task state. Second, the beliefs block estimates the skills and emotional state of learners. Third, the desires block validates the goals the robot can reach; the goals are grouped in skills development, emotional control, cognitive control, challenge control, life signals, and immediate support. Fourth, the intentions block, based on the goals competition strategy, selects the goal that the robot will perform. Finally, the action-planner block regulates the robot’s movements according to the robot’s emotions. The validation procedure was done with 53 learners ranging between 10 and 13 years old who study in public and private schools. Based on the research achievements, the robot fosters learning the Mean-Ends Analysis strategy and the solution of a problem. A video fragment that summarizes the research process is available in ."
10.1145/3527928,Neurophysiological and Behavioral Differences in Human-Multiagent Tasks: An EEG Network Perspective,"Effective human-multiagent teams will incorporate the cognitive skills of the human with the autonomous capabilities of the multiagent group to maximize task performance. However, producing a seamless fusion requires a greater understanding of the human’s cognitive state as it reacts to uncertainties in both the task environment and agent dynamics. This study examines external behaviors in concert with neurophysiological measures acquired via electroencephalography (EEG) to probe the interactions between cognitive processes, behaviors, and performance in a human-multiagent team task. We show that changes in the α (8–12 Hz) and θ (4–8 Hz) bands of EEG indicate a higher burden on the cognitive resources associated with visual-spatial reasoning required to estimate a more complex kinematic state of robotic agents. These results are reinforced by complementary behavioral shifts in gaze and pilot inputs. Additionally, higher-performing participants tend to engage more actively in the task by utilizing greater amounts of visual-spatial reasoning. Finally, we show that features based on EEG dynamic-network-metrics provide discriminative information that distinguishes gaze behaviors associated with the attention process."

10.1145/3532105.3535018,BlueSky: Combining Task Planning and Activity-Centric Access Control for Assistive Humanoid Robots,"In the not too distant future, assistive humanoid robots will provide versatile assistance for coping with everyday life. In their interactions with humans, not only safety, but also security and privacy issues need to be considered. In this Blue Sky paper, we therefore argue that it is time to bring task planning and execution as a well-established field of robotics with access and usage control in the field of security and privacy closer together. In particular, the recently proposed activity-based view on access and usage control provides a promising approach to bridge the gap between these two perspectives. We argue that humanoid robots provide for specific challenges due to their task-universality and their use in both, private and public spaces. Furthermore, they are socially connected to various parties and require policy creation at runtime due to learning. We contribute first attempts on the architecture and enforcement layer as well as on joint modeling, and discuss challenges and a research roadmap also for the policy and objectives layer. We conclude that the underlying combination of decentralized systems' and smart environments' research aspects provides for a rich source of challenges that need to be addressed on the road to deployment."
10.1145/3536167,Personal Space in Human-Robot Interaction at Work: Effect of Room Size and Working Memory Load,"A recent literature review on personal space in human-robot interaction identified a research gap for the influence of contextual factors. At the same time, psychological research on interpersonal distancing and theoretical considerations based on compensatory control models suggest the importance of considering these factors in robot path planning. To address this gap, we tested the effect of room size and working memory load on participants’ comfort distance toward an approaching robot. In a preregistered 3 \texttimes{} 2 within-subject design, N = 72 participants were approached by a mobile manufacturing robot in a corridor with varying room size and with and without a cognitive secondary task. As dependent variables, comfort distance, arousal, and perceived control were measured. While room size and working memory load had no significant direct effect on comfort distance, participants felt higher arousal and lower control in smaller rooms and in conditions with high working memory load, which in turn caused larger comfort distances (indirect effect). With experience, comfort distances decreased. Based on the indirect effects, future studies should test the effect of more extreme manipulations on comfort distances. Robots should adapt their path planning by keeping larger distances toward human workers in stressful environments to avoid discomfort."
10.1145/3539608,Social Relationship Analysis Using State-of-the-art Embeddings,"Detection of human relationships from their interactions on social media is a challenging problem with a wide range of applications in different areas, like targeted marketing, cyber-crime, fraud, defense, planning, and human resource, to name a few. All previous work in this area has only dealt with the most basic types of relationships. The proposed approach goes beyond the previous work to efficiently handle the hierarchy of social relationships. This article introduces a novel technique named Quantifiable Social Relationship (QSR) analysis for quantifying social relationships to analyze relationships between agents from their textual conversations. QSR uses cross-disciplinary techniques from computational linguistics and cognitive psychology to identify relationships. QSR utilizes sentiment and behavioral styles displayed in the conversations for mapping them onto level II relationship categories. Then, for identifying the level III relationship categories, QSR uses level II relationships, sentiments, interactions, and word embeddings as key features. QSR employs natural language processing techniques for feature engineering and state-of-the-art embeddings generated by word2vec, global vectors (glove), and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (bert). QSR combines the intrinsic conversational features with word embeddings for classifying relationships. QSR achieves an accuracy of up to 89\% for classifying relationship subtypes. The evaluation shows that QSR can accurately identify the hierarchical relationships between agents by extracting intrinsic and extrinsic features from textual conversations between agents."
10.1145/3543507.3583380,Response-act Guided Reinforced Dialogue Generation for Mental Health Counseling,"Virtual Mental Health Assistants (VMHAs) have become a prevalent method for receiving mental health counseling in the digital healthcare space. An assistive counseling conversation commences with natural open-ended topics to familiarize the client with the environment and later converges into more fine-grained domain-specific topics. Unlike other conversational systems, which are categorized as open-domain or task-oriented systems, VMHAs possess a hybrid conversational flow. These counseling bots need to comprehend various aspects of the conversation, such as dialogue-acts, intents, etc., to engage the client in an effective and appropriate conversation. Although the surge in digital health research highlights applications of many general-purpose response generation systems, they are barely suitable in the mental health domain – the prime reason is the lack of understanding in the mental health counseling conversation. Moreover, in general, dialogue-act guided response generators are either limited to a template-based paradigm or lack appropriate semantics in dialogue generation. To this end, we propose READER – a REsponse-Act guided reinforced Dialogue genERation model for the mental health counseling conversations. READER is built on transformer to jointly predict a potential dialogue-act dt + 1 for the next utterance (aka response-act) and to generate an appropriate response (ut + 1). Through the transformer-reinforcement-learning (TRL) with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we guide the response generator to abide by dt + 1 and ensure the semantic richness of the responses via BERTScore in our reward computation. We evaluate READER on HOPE, a benchmark counseling conversation dataset and observe that it outperforms several baselines across several evaluation metrics – METEOR, ROUGE, and BERTScore."
10.1145/3547578.3547592,A Real-time Smooth Lifting Path Planning for Tower Crane Based on TD3 with Discrete-Continuous Hybrid Action Space,"Smoothness and rapidity are two important performance indexes for crane lifting path planning. Traditionally, cranes are modeled as multi-freedom robots and use robot path planning algorithms to plan path in continuous space. However, the paths planned by these methods are not smooth enough to operate. In addition, presently, most of proposed lifting path planning algorithms focus on static environments, requiring accurate environmental information to build maps, which is too computation expensive to meet the requirement of real-time path planning. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based lifting path planning algorithm for hybrid action spaces. The network structure is developed based on TD3. A new reward function is designed and hindsight experience replay is used to solve the reward sparsity problem in long distance path planning. The planning path is smooth and can achieve real-time path planning in unknown environments. The result of simulation experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
10.1145/3548608.3559184,Research on position and attitude control method of planar motion of 5-DOF hybrid robot,"In the agriculture industry, scholars are increasingly paying attention to the advantages of hybrid robots and applying them in agricultural production. Agricultural products such as tree trunks or fruit stems is formed by growth. When the hybrid robot is working, It is easier to obtain the ideal end pose of the hybrid robot by describing the pose relationship of the robot end relative to the work object than the robot end relative to the world coordinate system. In order to realize the continuous motion control of the hybrid robot with a specified relative attitude relative to a certain plane in space, a method to realized planar motion based on 2SPU+U+RRR type five-degree-of-freedom hybrid robot position and attitude control is proposed. First, the trajectory of the task is discretized, according to the required posture, and the position and attitude matrix of each position on the trajectory is derived. Then through the inverse solution of the kinematic model, the five-degree-of-freedom hybrid robot is completely decoupled. The pose of the robot end is calculated to realize the plane motion control of the robot with a specified pose in Cartesian space according to the kinematic model of the hybrid robot based on the mechanism equivalent principle. Finally, the pose control method of the robot is tested. The experimental results show that the control method can realize the accurate planar motion control of the specified pose in Cartesian space during the repeated planar motion of the 2SPU+U+RRR type 5-DOF hybrid robot. This paper provides a five-degree-of-freedom hybrid robot theoretical model for the position and attitude synchronous motion control of arbitrary plane in Cartesian space."

A recent work investigated, using reactive synthesis, approaches to automate robot task planning, and execution. In this paper, we present a tool that realizes a model-at-runtime approach. The tool is integrated with a robot simulation tool, to automate efficient multi-robot choreography planning, and execution. We illustrate the tool using a multi-robot spot welding cell, inspired from an industrial case. Given a virtual model of the production cell, and user constraints definition, the tool can derive a specification for the reactive synthesis. The tool integrates the synthesized controller with the production cell execution, and in real time, optimizes the strategies by considering the uncertainties. The system can select among several correct, and safe actions, the optimal action using AI-based planning techniques, such as the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. We showcase our tool, illustrate its implementation architecture, including how it can support robot experts for automated planning and execution of production cells."
10.1145/3551708.3556203,MIXED REALITY MEDIA TECHNOLOGIES AS A CATALYST FOR ARCHITECTURAL AGENCY,"Though incredible strides have been made in the adoption of mixed reality technologies in the past decade, the reality is that they have often remained inaccessible for a variety of reasons including expense and expertise. While both the costs and learning curves of these technologies have flattened in recent years, they remain an esoteric component in contemporary pedagogy. This is fundamentally due to the lack of curricular and extracurricular application. This presentation demonstrates the effective adoption of virtual and augmented reality technologies in Canada's largest undergraduate accredited architecture program that has given agency to students in their academic design work and more noteworthy, their extracurricular initiatives. Through a comprehensive case study of a student project showcased at the recent international Winter Stations design exhibition, this paper demonstrates the effective inculcation, integration, and application of mixed reality tools in empowering students to bring their design ideas to built reality. The integration of innovative mixed reality technologies is no longer hampered by technological accessibility; it is mired by curricular inertia and dogma. The promise of breaking through conventional pedagogical frameworks with innovative technologies is reinforced and highlighted in this experiential learning precedent."
10.1145/3551902.3551962,Service Mesh Patterns,"As the benefits and applicability of microservice architectures become better understood by the software industry, and this architecture becomes increasingly more adopted for building stable, independent and scalable cloud applications, a new set of concerns have alerted developers regarding communication between the different microservices. A service mesh tries to address this issue by creating a clear separation of concerns between application logic and the infrastructure needed for the communication between the different services. This is accomplished by abstracting the cross-cutting concerns related with communication out of the internal services making it possible to be reused by the different services. Existing literature describes a service mesh pattern and a sidecar pattern. This paper leans on these patterns and proposes six patterns found by observing the, what is commonly called, good practices. The six patterns are service mesh, shared communication library, node agent, sidecar, service mesh team and control plane per cluster."
10.1145/3555776.3577657,Modeling a Conversational Agent using BDI Framework,"Building conversational agents to help humans in domain-specific tasks is challenging since the agent needs to understand the natural language and act over it while accessing domain expert knowledge. Modern natural language processing techniques led to an expansion of conversational agents, with recent pretrained language models achieving increasingly accurate language recognition results using ever-larger open datasets. However, the black-box nature of such pretrained language models obscures the agent's reasoning and its motivations when responding, leading to unexplained dialogues. We develop a belief-desire-intention (BDI) agent as a task-oriented dialogue system to introduce mental attitudes similar to humans describing their behavior during a dialogue. We compare the resulting model with a pipeline dialogue model by leveraging existing components from dialogue systems and developing the agent's intention selection as a dialogue policy. We show that combining traditional agent modelling approaches, such as BDI, with more recent learning techniques can result in efficient and scrutable dialogue systems."
10.1145/3564121.3564125,A Hybrid Planning System for Smart Charging of Electric Fleets,"Electric vehicle (EV) fleets are well suited for last-mile deliveries both from sustainability and operational cost perspectives. To ensure economic parity with non-EV options, even captive chargers for EV fleets need to be managed intelligently. Specifically, the EVs needs to be adequately charged for their entire delivery runs while handling reduced time flexibility between runs; limited number of chargers; and deviations from the planned schedule. Existing works either solve smaller instances of this problem optimally, or larger instances with significant sub-optimality. In addition, they typically consider either day-ahead or real-time planning in isolation. We complement existing works with a hybrid approach that first identifies a day-ahead plan for assigning EVs to chargers; and then uses online replanning to handle any deviations in real-time. For the day-ahead planning, we use a learning agent (LA) that learns to assign EVs to chargers over several problem instances. Because the agent solves a given instance during its testing phase, it achieves scale in problem size with limited sub-optimality. For the online replanning, we use a greedy heuristic that dynamically refines the day-ahead plan to handle delays in EV arrivals. We evaluate our approach using representative datasets. As baselines for the LA, we use an exact mixed-integer linear program (MILP) (greedy heuristic) for small (large) problem instances. As baselines for the replanning, we use no-planning and no-replanning. Our experiments show that LA performs better (8.5-14\%) than greedy heuristic in large problem instances, while being reasonably close (&lt; 22\%) to the optimal in smaller instances. For online replanning, our approach performs about 7-20\% better than no-planning and no-replanning for a range of delay profiles."
10.1145/3564121.3564817,Tutorial: Neuro-symbolic AI for Mental Healthcare,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for mental healthcare (MHCare) have been ever-growing after realizing the importance of early interventions for patients with chronic mental health (MH) conditions. Social media (SocMedia) emerged as the go-to platform for supporting patients seeking MHCare. The creation of peer-support groups without social stigma has resulted in patients transitioning from clinical settings to SocMedia supported interactions for quick help. Researchers started exploring SocMedia content in search of cues that showcase correlation or causation between different MH conditions to design better interventional strategies. User-level Classification-based AI systems were designed to leverage diverse SocMedia data from various MH conditions, to predict MH conditions. Subsequently, researchers created classification schemes to measure the severity of each MH condition. Such ad-hoc schemes, engineered features, and models not only require a large amount of data but fail to allow clinically acceptable and explainable reasoning over the outcomes. To improve Neural-AI for MHCare, infusion of clinical symbolic knowledge that clinicans use in decision making is required. An impactful use case of Neural-AI systems in MH is conversational systems. These systems require coordination between classification and generation to facilitate humanistic conversation in conversational agents (CA). Current CAs with deep language models lack factual correctness, medical relevance, and safety in their generations, which intertwine with unexplainable statistical classification techniques. This lecture-style tutorial will demonstrate our investigations into Neuro-symbolic methods of infusing clinical knowledge to improve the outcomes of Neural-AI systems to improve interventions for MHCare:(a) We will discuss the use of diverse clinical knowledge in creating specialized datasets to train Neural-AI systems effectively. (b) Patients with cardiovascular disease express MH symptoms differently based on gender differences. We will show that knowledge-infused Neural-AI systems can identify gender-specific MH symptoms in such patients. (c) We will describe strategies for infusing clinical process knowledge as heuristics and constraints to improve language models in generating relevant questions and responses."

Programmability in the data plane, cloud-native features like automatic scaling and failover, transparent acceleration of both network functions and applications and AI-driven optimizations are already present. We only need to integrate these different innovations into a consistent architecture and offer a simple yet powerful solution for the very different applications that would use future mobile networks. The application space is getting more and more heterogeneous, e.g., legacy Internet-based services still using the good old TCP protocol, future media services relying on multipath transport - always utilizing the best available connection, or control applications of robots or drones requiring extreme low and stable latency. The different applications will require very different Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) from the network. In this paper, we present a novel architecture called DESIRE6G (D6G) architecture that aims to fulfill these requirements by integrating the key technological innovations mentioned above. Besides supporting the diverse KPIs of future applications, the novel architecture should also simplify the mobile network itself by promoting modularity and service-based network function selection which can replace traditional control plane centric solutions, e.g., for handover."
10.1145/3565287.3617637,Toward a Better Understanding of the Emotional Dynamics of Negotiation with Large Language Models,"Current approaches to building negotiation agents rely either on model-based techniques that explicitly implement key principles of negotiation or model-free techniques leveraging algorithms developed via training on large amounts of human-generated text. We bridge these two approaches by combining a model-based approach with large language models for natural language understanding and generation. We find large language models perform well at recognizing dialogue acts and an opponent's emotions; perform reasonably well at recognizing opponents' preferences in the negotiation; and perform worse at understanding opponent offers. We also perform a qualitative comparison of the capabilities of our hybrid approach with a model-free method and find our hybrid agent provides safeguards against hallucinations and guarantees more control over aspects of negotiation such as emotional expressions, information sharing, and concession strategies."
10.1145/3583131.3590459,Using a Variational Autoencoder to Learn Valid Search Spaces of Safely Monitored Autonomous Robots for Last-Mile Delivery,"The use of autonomous robots for delivery of goods to customers is an exciting new way to provide a reliable and sustainable service. However, in the real world, autonomous robots still require human supervision for safety reasons. We tackle the real-world problem of optimizing autonomous robot timings to maximize deliveries, while ensuring that there are never too many robots running simultaneously so that they can be monitored safely. We assess the use of a recent hybrid machine-learning-optimization approach COIL (constrained optimization in learned latent space) and compare it with a baseline genetic algorithm for the purposes of exploring variations of this problem. We also investigate new methods for improving the speed and efficiency of COIL. We show that only COIL can find valid solutions where appropriate numbers of robots run simultaneously for all problem variations tested. We also show that when COIL has learned its latent representation, it can optimize 10\% faster than the GA, making it a good choice for daily re-optimization of robots where delivery requests for each day are allocated to robots while maintaining safe numbers of robots running at once."
10.1145/3583133.3596302,Quantum Enhancements for AlphaZero,"Reinforcement learning algorithms including AlphaZero are powerful artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, but are known to be resource intensive and unable to train within a reasonable budget. Speeding up learning would be valuable to further expand application areas for real world problems. In this paper, we investigate two quantum computing methods to enhance AlphaZero, with the goal of speeding up training. We evaluate the results by playing the board game Othello, an adversarial multi-agent turn based game similar to the game Go. First, parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) have been shown to train hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning agents in standard benchmark environments. With this inspiration, we replace the classical neural network with a PQC quantum neural network (QNN) in the AlphaZero architecture. Second, tensor-network quantum circuits have been used to extract important features for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks. Using this as inspiration, we use a tree tensor network (TTN) to extract features from the Othello game board, generating a new set of feature vectors for a classical neural network to estimate the policy and value. Results show both novel methods converge to master the game and achieve the same level of play compared to the classical AlphaZero agent."
10.1145/3586183.3606763,Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior,"Believable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive applications ranging from immersive environments to rehearsal spaces for interpersonal communication to prototyping tools. In this paper, we introduce generative agents: computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent’s experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty-five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors. For example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine’s Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent architecture—observation, planning, and reflection—each contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with computational interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior."
10.1145/3586996,CNN-based Robust Sound Source Localization with SRP-PHAT for the Extreme Edge,"Robust sound source localization for environments with noise and reverberation are increasingly exploiting deep neural networks fed with various acoustic features. Yet, state-of-the-art research mainly focuses on optimizing algorithmic accuracy, resulting in huge models preventing edge-device deployment. The edge, however, urges for real-time low-footprint acoustic reasoning for applications such as hearing aids and robot interactions. Hence, we set off from a robust CNN-based model using SRP-PHAT features, Cross3D&nbsp;[16], to pursue an efficient yet compact model architecture for the extreme edge. For both the SRP feature representation and neural network, we propose respectively our scalable LC-SRP-Edge and Cross3D-Edge algorithms which are optimized towards lower hardware overhead. LC-SRP-Edge halves the complexity and on-chip memory overhead for the sinc interpolation compared to the original LC-SRP&nbsp;[19]. Over multiple SRP resolution cases, Cross3D-Edge saves 10.32\%~73.71\% computational complexity and 59.77\%~94.66\% neural network weights against the Cross3D baseline. In terms of the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff, the most balanced version (EM) requires only 127.1 MFLOPS computation, 3.71 MByte/s bandwidth, and 0.821 MByte on-chip memory in total, while still retaining competitiveness in state-of-the-art accuracy comparisons. It achieves 8.59&nbsp;ms/frame end-to-end latency on a Rasberry Pi 4B, which is 7.26\texttimes{} faster than the corresponding baseline."
10.1145/3587259.3627561,Knowledge-enhanced Agents for Interactive Text Games,"Communication via natural language is a key aspect of machine intelligence, and it requires computational models to learn and reason about world concepts, with varying levels of supervision. Significant progress has been made on fully-supervised non-interactive tasks, such as question-answering and procedural text understanding. Yet, various sequential interactive tasks, as in text-based games, have revealed limitations of existing approaches in terms of coherence, contextual awareness, and their ability to learn effectively from the environment. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-injection framework for improved functional grounding of agents in text-based games. Specifically, we consider two forms of domain knowledge that we inject into learning-based agents: memory of previous correct actions and affordances of relevant objects in the environment. Our framework supports two representative model classes: reinforcement learning agents and language model agents. Furthermore, we devise multiple injection strategies for the above domain knowledge types and agent architectures, including injection via knowledge graphs and augmentation of the existing input encoding strategies. We experiment with four models on the 10 tasks in the ScienceWorld&nbsp;text-based game environment, to illustrate the impact of knowledge injection on various model configurations and challenging task settings. Our findings provide crucial insights into the interplay between task properties, model architectures, and domain knowledge for interactive contexts."
10.1145/3588432.3591510,Acting as Inverse Inverse Planning,"Great storytellers know how to take us on a journey. They direct characters to act—not necessarily in the most rational way—but rather in a way that leads to interesting situations, and ultimately creates an impactful experience for audience members looking on. If audience experience is what matters most, then can we help artists and animators directly craft such experiences, independent of the concrete character actions needed to evoke those experiences? In this paper, we offer a novel computational framework for such tools. Our key idea is to optimize animations with respect to simulated audience members’ experiences. To simulate the audience, we borrow an established principle from cognitive science: that human social intuition can be modeled as “inverse planning,” the task of inferring an agent’s (hidden) goals from its (observed) actions. Building on this model, we treat storytelling as “inverse inverse planning,” the task of choosing actions to manipulate an inverse planner’s inferences. Our framework is grounded in literary theory, naturally capturing many storytelling elements from first principles. We give a series of examples to demonstrate this, with supporting evidence from human subject studies."
10.1145/3589608.3595078,Poster: How to Raise a Robot - Beyond Access Control Constraints in Assistive Humanoid Robots,"Humanoid robots will be able to assist humans in their daily life, in particular due to their versatile action capabilities. However, while these robots need a certain degree of autonomy to learn and explore, they also should respect various constraints, for access control and beyond. We explore incorporating privacy and security constraints (Activity-Centric Access Control and Deep Learning Based Access Control) with robot task planning approaches (classical symbolic planning and end-to-end learning-based planning). We report preliminary results on their respective trade-offs and conclude that a hybrid approach will most likely be the method of choice. © 2023 Owner/Author."
10.1145/3592102,A Temporal Coherent Topology Optimization Approach for Assembly Planning of Bespoke Frame Structures,"We present a computational framework for planning the assembly sequence of bespoke frame structures. Frame structures are one of the most commonly used structural systems in modern architecture, providing resistance to gravitational and external loads. Building frame structures requires traversing through several partially built states. If the assembly sequence is planned poorly, these partial assemblies can exhibit substantial deformation due to self-weight, slowing down or jeopardizing the assembly process. Finding a good assembly sequence that minimizes intermediate deformations is an interesting yet challenging combinatorial problem that is usually solved by heuristic search algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new optimization-based approach that models sequence planning using a series of topology optimization problems. Our key insight is that enforcing temporal coherent constraints in the topology optimization can lead to sub-structures with small deformations while staying consistent with each other to form an assembly sequence. We benchmark our algorithm on a large data set and show improvements in both performance and computational time over greedy search algorithms. In addition, we demonstrate that our algorithm can be extended to handle assembly with static or dynamic supports. We further validate our approach by generating a series of results in multiple scales, including a real-world prototype with a mixed reality assistant using our computed sequence and a simulated example demonstrating a multi-robot assembly application."
10.1145/3594806.3596534,Voice-Based Conversational Agents and Knowledge Graphs for Improving News Search in Assisted Living,"As the healthcare sector faces major challenges, such as aging populations, staff shortages, and common chronic diseases, delivering high-quality care to individuals has become very difficult. Conversational agents have shown to be a promising technology to alleviate some of these issues. In the form of digital health assistants, they have the potential to improve the everyday life of the elderly and chronically ill people. This includes, for example, medication reminders, routine checks, or social chit-chat. In addition, conversational agents can satisfy the fundamental need of having access to information about daily news or local events, which enables individuals to stay informed and connected with the world around them. However, finding relevant news sources and navigating the plethora of online news articles can be overwhelming, particularly for those with limited technological literacy or health-related impairments. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative solution that combines knowledge graphs and conversational agents for news search in assisted living. By leveraging graph databases to semantically structure news data and implementing an intuitive voice-based interface, our system can help care-dependent people easily discover relevant news articles and give personalized recommendations. We explain our design choices, provide a system architecture, share insights of an initial user test, and give an outlook on planned future work."
10.1145/3598151.3598174,A Collision-free Path Planning Algorithm for Industrial Robots with Adaptive Search Mechanism,"In path planning for industrial robots, collision avoidance is a critical constraint. This paper studies the problem of collision-free motion planning for a spraying robot, i.e., obtaining a series of joint configurations along a given spraying waypoint that satisfies the collision constraints and satisfy the kinematics of the robot. Aiming at this problem, a collision-free motion optimization algorithm based on the adaptive search is proposed in this paper. First, a boundary volume hierarchy (BVH) of the robot and environment is quickly generated based on the GPU parallel architecture. Second, the redundancy of spray incidence angles is used to search for feasible spray incidence angle directions in the redundant space and update the robot's BVHs for collision detection. In addition, during the optimization iterations, the size of the search space is adaptively reduced according to the number of collision failures in the previous iterations to avoid falling into a local optimum. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulation on a six-degrees-of-freedom robot performing a spraying task."
10.1145/3598151.3598191,A Hierarchical Autonomous Exploration Algorithm for Large-scale and Complex Environments with Mobile Robot,"In order to solve the problem of low exploration efficiency caused by repeatedly backtracking the frontiers in large and complex environments, a hierarchical autonomous exploration algorithm is proposed. Firstly, based on the robot's static model to judge the environment's traversability, which allows robots to explore complex 3D environments. Following that, a hybrid strategy is used to filter out frontiers within a local planning horizon, thus complete exploration of the local area is achieved by solving the traveling salesman problem (TSP). Finally, the sparse global topology map generates transfer paths between sub-areas, transferring the robot to another sub-area to resume exploration. Compared to the RRT autonomous exploration algorithm and the GBP autonomous exploration algorithm, the method in this work reduces the exploration path by more than 13.8\% and the exploration time by more than 23.7\%. The results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the autonomous exploration efficiency of mobile robots in large and complex environments."
10.1145/3603269.3604860,EBB: Reliable and Evolvable Express Backbone Network in Meta,"We present the design, implementation, evaluation, deployment and production experiences of EBB (Express BackBone), a private WAN (Wide Area Network) connecting Meta's global data centers (DCs). Initiated in 2015, EBB now carries 100\% of DC-DC traffic, witnessing remarkable growth over the years. A key design aspect of EBB is its multi-plane architecture, facilitating seamless deployment of a new control plane while ensuring operational simplicity. This architecture allows for efficient failure mitigation, standard maintenance, and capacity expansion by draining one or two planes without impacting service level objectives (SLOs). Another critical design decision is the hybrid model, combining distributed control agents and a central controller. EBB's centralized traffic engineering utilizes an MPLS-TE based solution to allocate paths periodically for different traffic classes based on service requirements, while its distributed control agents enable fast local failure recovery by pre-installing pre-computed backup paths in the data plane. We delve into our eight-year production experience, highlighting the successful deployment of multiple generations of EBB."
10.1145/3604571.3604572,Empathy-Driven Innovation: Analysis of Five User-Centered Design Thinking Case Studies,"Design Thinking (DT) is widely used to drive innovation in companies. DT consists of five phases: empathy, define, ideation, prototype, and test. However, companies often skip the empathy process and go directly to the ideation phase. It is because empathy cannot immediately solve problems, is time- and resource-consuming, and is hindered by the cognitive bias that companies believe they already know what users or customers want. This article presents the process of empathy in five cases of Design Thinking (DT) projects in Indonesia carried out by postgraduate students who have worked in the companies for years. The projects discussed are a bank's marketing plan for ultra-micro entrepreneurs, the development of an online community platform by a software development company, the creation of tourist attractions in a forest area by the government tourism agency, the creation of an online ecosystem for the footwear industry by the government, and the development of a digital e-contract by a state-owned enterprise. We conducted a comparative case study analysis to examine the empathy process in meeting user needs and achieving innovation in these projects. This article argues that optimizing the empathic process in DT can lead to innovation. However, this empathic phase should continue through the ideation, prototyping, and testing phases. An individual who works in a company can initiate and carry out this empathy process. Nevertheless, the following phases require the support and involvement of all stakeholders in the company."
10.1145/3607720.3607796,"Tweets similarity classification based on Machine Learning Algorithms, TF-IDF and the Dynamic Case Based Reasoning","The research on the field of Twitter sentiment analysis, which aims to extract users’ sentiments through their public opinion about a given topic, has been increased and grown rapidly across a broad range of disciplines in the last decade. In this article, we propose a hybrid approach for Tweets similarity classification Based on Dynamic Case Based Reasoning approach, machine learning algorithms and Multi-Agent System. Our approach proposes a multi-agent adaptive system for Tweets similarity classification. It combines the Dynamic Case-Based Reasoning approach with the scientific measurement of keyword weight (Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency, TF-IDF). It consists of gathering and pre-processing tweets about a given topic and use a feature extraction to extract useful features. Machine Learning algorithms are then used for similarity content-based classification. Our approach is general and can be used to follow users’ tweets traces to predict their sentiments and provide them with an individualized content. In this study, Covid-19 tweets have been taken as an example."
10.1145/3610068,How Time Pressure in Different Phases of Decision-Making Influences Human-AI Collaboration,"Human cognitive and decision-making abilities depreciate under pressure, motivating the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) systems as decision support tools to assist people in performing tasks under stress. In this work, we study human decision-making behavior and task performance under time pressure---induced from limitedinitial observation time (time to perform the task before providing an initial response without AI input) andfinal decision time (time to weigh an AI's suggestion before reaching a collective human-AI team answer)---for spatial reasoning and count estimation tasks. Our results show that, while the impact of initial observation time on AI-assisted decision-making was dependent on task nature, participants were more likely to follow AI suggestions when they were provided with longer final decision time; moreover, although participants generally tended to adhere to their initial responses, they had more agency when they were more logically engaged in a task. Our results offer a nuanced understanding of human-AI collaboration under time pressure in different phases of the decision-making process."
10.1145/3610419.3610435,Mathematical modeling and control of Biomimetic Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (BAUV) based on flapping propulsion,"Bioinspired underwater vehicles which mimic motion from flapping gait of marine fishes can benefit from the flight efficiency and silent maneuver in aquatic environments. However, there is a very limited amount of research which focuses on mapping the flapping fin propulsion to model the complete dynamics of the bioinspired robot. Multiple parameters like amplitude of motion, flapping frequency and initial angle of attack affect the overall motion dynamics. In this work, the propulsive thrust generated from the undulating fin structure is numerically investigated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study. Further, this non-linear thrust map is used to formulate the mathematical model of the proposed biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicle (BAUV). To validate the trajectory tracking performance of the proposed system in 2D planar maneuver, coupled dynamics of the underactuated vehicle (with one caudal, and two dorsal fins) is derived and hybrid control strategy is implemented. Trajectory tracking control of the proposed structure is also studied which is challenging because of the oscillatory motions of the fins. For a L-shaped trajectory of edge length 200m, the proposed BAUV with a span-length of 2.5 m is capable to render the desired trajectory with permissible error of 0.2 m, maximum flapping frequency of 0.6 Hz and dorsal fin deflection of 25 degrees which verify the accuracy of the proposed BAUV model."
10.1145/3610419.3610475,Redundantly Actuated Hybrid Kinematic setup for high Manipulability,"Robot workspace and Manipulability analysis are essential for choosing the most optimum robot and planning the Toolpath for a particular task. Standard industrial robots can be modified to increase their workspace and overall Manipulability by moving their base on a predetermined optimum track, thus, increasing their overall effectivity. Hybrid robot kinematic chains can benefit from both the properties of having a serial and parallel chain, giving maneuverability and dexterity, along with good accuracy and rigidity. This paper aims to find the advantages of moving such a hybrid system on a curved track by comparing the Manipulability plots in the reachable workspace. The track can be optimized per the user’s demand for the lower limit of Manipulability, which may vary as per the task the machine has to perform."
10.1145/3610579.3611082,Explaining Unsolvability of Planning Problems in Hybrid Systems with Model Reconciliation,"A recent problem of interest in Explainable AI Planning is that of explaining the unsolvability of planning problems. Though there has been a lot of research on generating explanations of solutions to planning problems, explaining the absence of solutions remains a largely open and understudied problem. Model reconciliation has been a popular approach for generating explanations for such problems in recent literature, which involves an AI agent and a human planner, who have different models of the planning domain and each explains to the other the differences they have in their domain representations and attempt to arrive at a consensus. More often than not, it is assumed that the AI agent has a correct and complete view of the domain, of which the human only has a partial view. Through reconciliation, the human domain is updated to be consistent with what the AI agent has. Most of the works in this direction are targeted toward classical planning problems on domains represented typically as discrete state transition systems or variants. In this paper, we provide an approach towards model reconciliation for planning problems in hybrid systems represented as a mix of discrete and continuous domains. We assume that the agent has a complete model of the environment, while the human has a partial or erroneous model and expects a plan for the planning problem when there is none. The explanation problem is presented as a process of continuous reconciliation between these two entities (agent and human) to make the human domain consistent with that of the agent. To this effect, we use a mix of graph traversal and path analysis, along with Linear programming to carry out the reconciliation process. In particular, we use the concept of Irreducible Infeasible Sets (IIS) to generate explanations. Experimental results on 2 representative hybrid domains show the efficacy of our approach."
10.1145/3610661.3617514,Design of Generative Multimodal AI Agents to Enable Persons with Learning Disability,"The recent advances in Multimodal AI \&amp; Generative AI open doors to the possibilities of solving key challenges for Persons with Learning Disability. To assist individuals facing difficulty in visual or auditory perception, this paper designs \&amp; develops a multimodal AI agent using recent advances in the field. We aim to solve the challenge of enabling persons with Visual or Auditory Processing Disorders to learn \&amp; communicate. We do this by exploring a design that allows the transformation of information across visual and language modalities. This design can be realized with the recent advances in Generative Multimodal AI. Based on each individual's needs, the AI agent dynamically adapts the Human Computer interaction model. For instance, for a child with Visual Processing Disorder (VPD), given the child's hindered ability to make sense of information taken in through the eyes, the Multimodal AI agent transforms any visual information into auditory user interaction. In another instance, for a person with Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), given the hindrance in the individual's ability to analyze information taken in through the ears, the AI dynamically translates any speech modality into visual cues. Thus the AI agent adapts dynamically to the strengths and abilities of the individual. To enable students with VPD to learn, the design allows the student to ask questions about an image. This design is realized as a Visual Question Answering task in Vision Language Transformer models. We explore interactive multimodal conversations with Few shot Learning and In-Context Instruction Tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models to address difficulty in visual reasoning. To enable persons with CAPD to learn, the design translates audio lectures into visual cues. This visual cue consists of a combination of words using speech recognition and Large Language Models based re-phrasing to simpler words, cross-modal retrieval of images to address auditory memory challenges, and AI-generated images. To identify the strengths of each child, we also explore Multimodal embedding based Multimodal latent space arithmetic to link AI across senses. To effectively integrate the proposed design into the mainstream, we explore a universal design based inclusive approach to extend the use case to create AI assistants for assisting children with different learning styles such as visual learners or auditory learners. To enable future research on the proposed design, we explore an architecture to compose a pipeline of AI models, and to connect with external systems via plugin connectors. We implement lab scale prototypes of this design and present a demo on the project webpage at https://sites.google.com/view/multimodallearningdisability."
10.1145/3613904.3642465,The Adaptive Architectural Layout: How the Control of a Semi-Autonomous Mobile Robotic Partition was Shared to Mediate the Environmental Demands and Resources of an Open-Plan Office,"A typical open-plan office layout is unable to optimally host multiple collocated work activities, personal needs, and situational events, as its space exerts a range of environmental demands on workers in terms of maintaining their acoustic, visual or privacy comfort. As we hypothesise that these demands could be coped by optimising the environmental resources of the architectural layout, we deployed a mobile robotic partition that autonomously manoeuvres between predetermined locations. During a five-weeks in-the-wild study within a real-world open-plan office, we studied how 13 workers adopted four distinct adaptation strategies when sharing the spatiotemporal control of the robotic partition. Based on their logged and self-reported reasoning, we present six initiation regulating factors that determine the appropriateness of each adaptation strategy. This study thus contributes to how future human-building interaction could autonomously improve the experience, comfort, performance, and even the health and wellbeing of multiple workers that share the same workplace."
10.1145/3614321.3614356,Enterprise architecture adoption in government: a public value perspective,"Substantial research has been conducted to investigate the value that Enterprise Architecture (EA) can generate for organizations. However, there is also a need to empirically explore the mechanisms involved in creating this value. Against this backdrop, this paper aims to answer the research question: “Which mechanisms contribute to generating value through using Enterprise Architecture in government?” The research was conducted through a survey administered to Swedish government organizations, directed by a public value framework. The data analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics and an inductive analysis of open-text answers. The findings reveal values associated with the use of EA in government and corresponding value-generating mechanisms. Core activities in the municipalities consist of establishing digital value chains where values are generated for citizens and the internal administration. National agencies engage more in creating strategic value through intrinsic enhancements enabled via EA to establish organizational commonalities. Our findings informed a conceptual framework, which encompasses organizing principles, core EA activities, and applications. This research contributes to the literature on the use of EA in government by highlighting EA activities related to the strategic orientation of organizational operations and enablers for deriving valuable results from these activities. Our framework, informed by theories of public value and results from practice, provides a roadmap for public managers to plan and operationalize their architectural work. By doing so, we contribute to establishing an important link between research on EA in the public sector and public value theory. We conclude the paper with suggesting additional research on two identified research gaps: 1. Using EA for participatory processes, 2. Further investigation of evaluation practices."
10.1145/3623263.3623359,Reinforcement learning for scaffold-free construction of spanning structures,"In construction robotics, a conventional design-to-fabrication workflow starts with designing a structure, followed by task and robotic motion planning, and ultimately, fabrication. However, this approach can prove unsuccessful, as we may only discover the infeasibility of a design at the final stages of the process. This can result in rework and a considerable waste of time and resources. To overcome this challenge, we propose a design method based on reinforcement learning (RL) where the agent makes decisions at every step of the sequential assembly of the structure while considering assembly’s stability. In this way, we take the construction constraints into consideration at the design stage. The research particularly focuses on the design of spanning structures that multiple robot arms can construct without the need for scaffolding. A series of experiments were conducted using both a centralized and a decentralized learning setup. Our results show that while the decentralized setup was successful in constructing smaller structures, only the centralized setup allowed active collaboration between robot arms, resulting in structures with larger spans. To validate our approach, we fabricated two of the designed structures with two collaborating robot arms, which confirmed the feasibility of these designs. In summary, the proposed method opens exciting possibilities for generating innovative designs that push the boundaries of architectural creativity while simultaneously fulfilling fabrication-related constraints."
10.1145/3623385,“Do This Instead”—Robots That Adequately Respond to Corrected Instructions,"Natural language instructions are effective at tasking autonomous robots and for teaching them new knowledge quickly. Yet, human instructors are not perfect and are likely to make mistakes at times and will correct themselves when they notice errors in their own instructions. In this article, we introduce a complete system for robot behaviors to handle such corrections, during both task instruction and action execution. We then demonstrate its operation in an integrated cognitive robotic architecture through spoken language in two tasks: a navigation and retrieval task and a meal assembly task. Verbal corrections occur before, during, and after verbally taught sequences of tasks, demonstrating that the proposed methods enable fast corrections not only of the semantics generated from the instructions but also of overt robot behavior in a manner shown to be reasonable when compared to human behavior and expectations."
10.1145/3623387,"UHTP: A User-Aware Hierarchical Task Planning Framework for Communication-Free, Mutually-Adaptive Human-Robot Collaboration","Collaborative human-robot task execution approaches require mutual adaptation, allowing both the human and robot partners to take active roles in action selection and role assignment to achieve a single shared goal. Prior works have utilized a leader-follower paradigm in which either agent must follow the actions specified by the other agent. We introduce the User-aware Hierarchical Task Planning (UHTP) framework, a communication-free human-robot collaborative approach for adaptive execution of multi-step tasks that moves beyond the leader-follower paradigm. Specifically, our approach enables the robot to observe the human, perform actions that support the human’s decisions, and actively select actions that maximize the expected efficiency of the collaborative task. In turn, the human chooses actions based on their observation of the task and the robot, without being dictated by a scheduler or the robot. We evaluate UHTP both in simulation and in a human subjects experiment of a collaborative drill assembly task. Our results show that UHTP achieves more efficient task plans and shorter task completion times than non-adaptive baselines across a wide range of human behaviors, that interacting with a UHTP-controlled robot reduces the human’s cognitive workload, and that humans prefer to work with our adaptive robot over a fixed-policy alternative."
10.1145/3625156.3625189,Efficient Mobile Robot Navigation with D* Lite and Bellman Ford Hybrid Algorithm,"Robotics is a challenging area which is highly employed in various fields, including industry, logistics, healthcare, and transportation. They need effective and reliable path planning algorithms to navigate in complicated and dynamic situations. Due to its effectiveness and optimality, the hybridized algorithm has recently become a well-liked approach for resolving path planning issues in robotics. In this article, the D* Lite algorithm's implementation was done using Bellman ford Shortest Path Algorithm to achieve improved path quality and their performance assessment was done using different 2D maps. The theoretical foundation of the algorithm, its simulation implementation, and practical findings proving its efficiency regarding computing time, path distance and various other metrics are all presented in this article. It has been verified through both theoretical and empirical results that the novel hybrid technique can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the D*Lite. Simulation results are very much effective as D* lite implementation includes bellman ford algorithm for achieving nearly 25\% reduced computation time as well as 36\% improved optimal path length."
10.1145/3627611.3627616,Engaging Cities: From Urban Space to Media Interface,"Technology in this millennium has evolved to become a conduit for communication, creative expression and knowledge transmission. Central to this is the designer's agentic role in mediating the percolation of the digital into the built environment to produce new and transformative experiences incorporating mixed reality. Through discussing two speculative projects, this paper poses the question of what instigative role media might play in efforts to boost spatial ambience and social agency. The first reimagines an AR media architecture experience: by expanding the scope of screen media to include touch media and mobile media, handheld devices fulfil a fresh function, to re-center the urban experience alongside encouraging multidimensional user interaction. Meanwhile, a virtually mediated tour conceived to explore interactions between media and architecture, user agency and behavior, redefines an appreciation for the mimetic. While VR is unable to replicate the randomness and complexity of real-world experience, the sensorial richness of the lived environment and in-person interactions, insights can still be gleaned by how people navigate in cities, even in a simulated environment. These examples reconfirm how our relationship with urban space has been irrevocably altered by digital affordance, through interpretation, interactions and interventions. They open up a dialogue on other alternatives to traditional notions and practices of media architecture. Given the proliferation of digital and online tools and platforms, it stands to reason that now is the opportune time to enskill and empower designers to seize control of the technological ensemble, and exploit what the digital affords, to interpret new and meaningful uses."
10.1145/3632410.3632430,DSDF: Coordinated look-ahead strategy in multi-agent reinforcement learning with noisy agents,"Existing methods of Multi-Agent Reinforcement learning, involving Centralized Training and Decentralized execution, attempt to train the agents towards learning a pattern of coordinated actions to arrive at optimal joint policy. However, during the execution phase, if some of the agents degrade and perform noisy actions (not the same actions suggested by policy) to varying degrees, the above methods provide poor coordination. In this paper, we show how such random noise in agents, which could be a result of the degradation or aging of robots, can add to the uncertainty in coordination and thereby contribute to unsatisfactory global rewards. In such a scenario, the agents which are in accordance with the policy have to understand the behavior and limitations of the noisy agents while the noisy agents have to plan in cognizance of their limitations. In our proposed method, Deep Stochastic Discount Factor (DSDF), based on the degree of degradation the algorithm tunes the discount factor for each agent uniquely, thereby altering the global planning of the agents. Moreover, given the degree of degradation in some agents is expected to change over time, our method provides a framework under which such changes can be incrementally addressed without extensive retraining. Results on benchmark environments show the efficacy of the DSDF approach when compared with existing approaches."

A new aspect is artificial intelligence, which Smart Cities could greatly benefit from. A central problem for urban designers is the unavailability of data to make relevant decisions. Agent-based simulations enable a view of the dynamic properties of the urban system, generating data in its course. However, the simulation must remain sufficiently simple to remain in the realm of computability. The research question of this paper is: How can we make agents behave more realistically to analyze citizens’ mobility behavior? To solve this problem, we first created a simulated virtual environment, where agents can move freely in a small part of a city, the harbor area in Hamburg, Germany. We assumed that happiness is a crucial motivating factor for the movement of citizens. A survey of 130 citizens provided the weights that govern the simulated environment and the happiness score assignation of places. As an AI method, we then used Reinforcement Learning as a general model and Q-learning as an algorithm to generate a baseline. Through randomly traversing the model environment a baseline was created. We are in the process of enhancing Reinforcement Learning with a Deep Q-Network to make the actors learn. Early experiments show a significant improvement over a tabular Q-learning approach. This paper contributes to the literature of urban planning, and data-driven architectural design. The main contribution is replacing the inefficient search for a global maximum of the happiness function, with an efficient local solution global maximum. This has implications for further research in the generation of synthetic data through simulations."
10.1145/3638529.3654013,Towards Multi-Morphology Controllers with Diversity and Knowledge Distillation,"Finding controllers that perform well across multiple morphologies is an important milestone for large-scale robotics, in line with recent advances via foundation models in other areas of machine learning. However, the challenges of learning a single controller to control multiple morphologies make the 'one robot one task' paradigm dominant in the field. To alleviate these challenges, we present a pipeline that: (1) leverages Quality Diversity algorithms like MAP-Elites to create a dataset of many single-task/single-morphology teacher controllers, then (2) distills those diverse controllers into a single multi-morphology controller that performs well across many different body plans by mimicking the sensory-action patterns of the teacher controllers via supervised learning. The distilled controller scales well with the number of teachers/morphologies and shows emergent properties. It generalizes to unseen morphologies in a zero-shot manner, providing robustness to morphological perturbations and instant damage recovery. Lastly, the distilled controller is also independent of the teacher controllers - we can distill the teacher's knowledge into any controller model, making our approach synergistic with architectural improvements and existing training algorithms for teacher controllers."
10.1145/3638530.3654431,Quality Diversity for Robot Learning: Limitations and Future Directions,"Quality Diversity (QD) has shown great success in discovering high-performing, diverse policies for robot skill learning. While current benchmarks have led to the development of powerful QD methods, we argue that new paradigms must be developed to facilitate open-ended search and generalizability. In particular, many methods focus on learning diverse agents that each move to a different xy position in MAP-Elites-style bounded archives. Here, we show that such tasks can be accomplished with a single, goal-conditioned policy paired with a classical planner, achieving O(1) space complexity w.r.t. the number of policies and generalization to task variants. We hypothesize that this approach is successful because it extracts task-invariant structural knowledge by modeling a relational graph between adjacent cells in the archive. We motivate this view with emerging evidence from computational neuroscience and explore connections between QD and models of cognitive maps in human and other animal brains. We conclude with a discussion exploring the relationships between QD and cognitive maps, and propose future research directions inspired by cognitive maps towards future generalizable algorithms capable of truly open-ended search. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."
10.1145/3638530.3664116,Improving Efficiency of Evolving Robot Designs via Self-Adaptive Learning Cycles and an Asynchronous Architecture,"Algorithmic frameworks for the joint optimisation of a robot's design and controller often utilise a learning loop nested within an evolutionary algorithm to refine the controller associated with a newly generated robot design. Intuitively, it is reasonable to assume that the length of the learning period required is directly related to the complexity of the new design. Therefore, we propose a novel self-adaptive criterion that modifies the learning budget for each individual robot based on setting a target for the progress to be achieved during learning. This stopping criterion can lead to wide variance in learning times per robot evaluated. Research in other domains where variable evaluation time is also observed has suggested that asynchronous architectures are preferable in this situation, leading to improved objective performance and efficiency. We conduct a systematic comparison of synchronous and asynchronous architectures using the new learning stopping criterion in a joint optimisation task, showing that a judicious choice of target learning progress used in conjunction with an asynchronous framework provides considerably better results in terms of fitness and computational efficiency than a synchronous framework --- in the latter, the choice of target learning progress has no significant influence."

However, current design systems are policy-driven, which limits the ability to redesign the 5G network adaptively for requirements or traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose Conrad, an autonomous and intent-driven framework that can allocate resources efficiently to meet 5G slice requirements. Via the use of a cognitive intent handling engine, the requirements are transformed to goals that may be solved using machine reasoning techniques. Four agents are registered for forecasting, design planning, evaluation and actuation to enable dynamic re-design of the 5G slices. Exploiting automated planning techniques, proposals are provided to optimally provision the network slice resources. This process is demonstrated over a radio access network (RAN) slicing use case with intents on average expected throughput."

Plant-robot hybrids that grow and decay incorporate unpredictable and gradual transformations inherent across living organisms and suggest an alternative to the design principles of immediacy, responsiveness, control, accuracy, and durability commonly found in robotic design. To explore this, we present a design space of primitives for plant-driven robotic actuators. Proof-of-concept prototypes illustrate how concepts like slow change, slow movement, decay, and destruction can be incorporated into robotic forms.

However, while these robots need a certain degree of autonomy to learn and explore, they also should respect various constraints, for access control and beyond. We explore the novel field of incorporating privacy, security, and access control constraints with robot task planning approaches.

From analyzing their trade-offs, we conclude that a hybrid approach is necessary, and thereby present a new use case for the emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence."

10.1145/3652628.3652670,Multi-Constraint Flexible Job Scheduling Algorithm Based on DDQN: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Solving Practical Job Scheduling Problems,"As an important part of intelligent manufacturing, reasonable scheduling of production planning is very important for reducing costs and increasing efficiency. This paper considers that the current algorithms related to intelligent scheduling do not consider the actual constraints enough, and the solution efficiency cannot satisfy the application requirements. Considering the actual industrial production and a variety of practical constraints including employee attendance time and machine start-up time, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning algorithm. The goal of this research is to minimize the total production cost including product processing costs, employee overtime costs, order back-order costs, finished and semi-finished product inventory costs. In this paper, the intelligent scheduling problem is modeled as a Markov decision-making process, and the agent selects and executes actions according to the state at each decision-making stage. In this paper, the Double DQN neural network architecture is built. Seven features are extracted from the scheduling environment to form a feature vector representation state, and six composite scheduling rules are designed to form an action set considering the optimization goal. A reward function closely related to the goal is designed. Numerical experiments show that the quality of the solution set obtained by the reinforcement learning algorithm is better than or similar to that of the genetic algorithm, and the solution speed is significantly better than that of other algorithms, which proves the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm."
10.1145/3652628.3652828,Robot trajectory optimization design based on hybrid ant colony algorithm,"This thesis investigates the innovative integration and application of algorithms of hybrid ant colony algorithm in solving intelligent robot path optimization problems. Among the many branches of intelligent robots, the path planning problem is a particularly important one, and with the development of science and technology and the wide application of intelligent robots, the design of robot trajectory optimization is facing new challenges. The native ant colony algorithm is easy to fall into the local optimal solution in dealing with the problem of robot path planning. Through algorithm analysis, a hybrid ant colony algorithm is proposed. When integrating genetic algorithm and incorporating crossover and mutation factors into the hybrid ant colony algorithm, it not only enhances the diversity of the population, but also speeds up the convergence speed of the algorithm and improves the quality of the optimal solution. The case study shows that the combination of ant colony algorithm and genetic algorithm effectively avoids the problems of instability and poor robustness of the traditional ant colony algorithm, and a more efficient and stable path planning solution can be obtained, which further improves the working effect of the intelligent robot."

10.1145/3654439,The IDEA of Us: An Identity-Aware Architecture for Autonomous Systems,"Autonomous systems, such as drones and rescue robots, are increasingly used during emergencies. They deliver services and provide situational awareness that facilitate emergency management and response. To do so, they need to interact and cooperate with humans in their environment. Human behaviour is uncertain and complex, so it can be difficult to reason about it formally. In this article, we propose IDEA: an adaptive software architecture that enables cooperation between humans and autonomous systems, by leveraging the social identity approach. This approach establishes that group membership drives human behaviour. Identity and group membership are crucial during emergencies, as they influence cooperation among survivors. IDEA systems infer the social identity of surrounding humans, thereby establishing their group membership. By reasoning about groups, we limit the number of cooperation strategies the system needs to explore. IDEA systems select a strategy from the equilibrium analysis of game-theoretic models that represent interactions between group members and the IDEA system. We demonstrate our approach using a search-and-rescue scenario, in which an IDEA rescue robot optimises evacuation by collaborating with survivors. Using an empirically validated agent-based model, we show that the deployment of the IDEA system can reduce median evacuation time by 13.6\%."
10.1145/3657054.3657119,Digital Government Ecosystem: Adaptive Architecture for Digital and ICT Investment Decision Making,"Agencies, while operating in the federated digital government ecosystem, need to make significant investments in digital and information and communication technology (ICT) for providing services to people and businesses. A whole-of-government adaptive architecture driven approach seems appropriate for supporting common language and consistent digital and ICT investment decision making. It enables adaptive planning and implementation with a view to make an optimal use of public funds and aligned with the strategic direction and priorities in digital and ICT investments. However, the challenge is how to establish the adaptive architecture for supporting digital and ICT investment decision making in the complex and federated digital government ecosystem. This paper proposes the adaptive enterprise architecture (AEA) meta-framework for digital ecosystems, as a lens, to systematically integrate the Australian Government Architecture (AGA), and Digital and ICT Oversight Investment Framework (IOF) in establishing the adaptive architecture for assisting digital and ICT investment decisions within complex digital government ecosystems. The proposed approach is demonstrated and evaluated with the help of an example scenario for an Australian digital government service. The results of this study indicate that the adaptive architecture driven approach involving AGA and IOF seems useful for architecting and supporting complex digital and ICT investment decision making to deliver the holistic outcomes of data and digital government strategy objectives."
10.1145/3659061,Generating Pattern-Based Conventions for Predictable Planning in Human–Robot Collaboration,"For humans to effectively work with robots, they must be able to predict the actions and behaviors of their robot teammates rather than merely react to them. While there are existing techniques enabling robots to adapt to human behavior, there is a demonstrated need for methods that explicitly improve humans’ ability to understand and predict robot behavior at multi-task timescales. In this work, we propose a method leveraging the innate human propensity for pattern recognition in order to improve team dynamics in human–robot teams and to make robots more predictable to the humans that work with them. Patterns are a cognitive tool that humans use and rely on often, and the human brain is in many ways primed for pattern recognition and usage. We propose pattern-aware convention-setting for teaming (PACT), an entropy-based algorithm that identifies and imposes appropriate patterns over a robot’s planner or policy over long time horizons. These patterns are autonomously generated and chosen via an algorithmic process that considers human-perceptible features and characteristics derived from the tasks to be completed, and as such, produces behavior that is easier for humans to identify and predict. Our evaluation shows that PACT contributes to significant improvements in team dynamics and teammate perceptions of the robot, as compared to robots that utilize traditionally ‘optimal’ plans and robots utilizing unoptimized patterns."
10.1145/3664647.3681657,StableMoFusion: Towards Robust and Efficient Diffusion-based Motion Generation Framework,"Thanks to the powerful generative capacity of diffusion models, recent years have witnessed rapid progress in human motion generation. Existing diffusion-based methods employ disparate network architectures and training strategies. The effect of the design of each component is still unclear. In addition, the iterative denoising process consumes considerable computational overhead, which is prohibitive for real-time scenarios such as virtual characters and humanoid robots. For this reason, we first conduct a comprehensive investigation into network architectures, training strategies, and inference process. Based on the profound analysis, we tailor each component for efficient high-quality human motion generation. Despite the promising performance, the tailored model still suffers from foot skating which is an ubiquitous issue in diffusion-based solutions. To eliminate footskate, we identify foot-ground contact and correct foot motions along the denoising process. By organically combining these well-designed components together, we present StableMoFusion, a robust and efficient framework for human motion generation. Extensive experimental results show that our StableMoFusion performs favorably against current state-of-the-art methods."
10.1145/3665331,Generating and Evaluating Data of Daily Activities with an Autonomous Agent in a Virtual Smart Home,"Training machine learning models to identify human behavior is a difficult yet essential task to develop autonomous and adaptive systems such as smart homes. These models require large and diversified amounts of labeled data to be trained effectively. Due to the high variety of home environments and occupant behaviors, collecting datasets that are representative of all possible homes is a major challenge. In addition, privacy and cost are major hurdles to collect real home data. To avoid these difficulties, one solution consists of training these models using purely synthetic data, which can be generated through the simulation of home and their occupants. Two challenges arise from this approach: designing a methodology with a simulation able to generate credible simulated data and evaluating this credibility. In this article, we explain the methodology used to generate diversified synthetic data of daily activities, through the combination of an agent model to simulate an occupant and a simulated 3D house enriched with sensors and effectors to produce such data. We demonstrate the credibility of the generated synthetic data by comparing their efficacy for training human context understanding models against the efficacy generated by real data. To achieve this, we replicate a real dataset collection setting with our smart home simulator. The occupant is replaced by an autonomous agent following the same experimental protocol used for the real dataset collection. This agent is a BDI-based model enhanced with a scheduler designed to offer a balance between control and autonomy. This balance is useful in synthetic data generation since strong constraints can be imposed on the agent to simulate desired situations while allowing autonomous behaviors outside these constraints to generate diversified data. In our case, the constraints are those imposed during the real dataset collection that we want to replicate. The simulated sensors and effectors were configured to react to the agent’s behaviors similarly to the real ones. We experimentally show that data generated from this simulation are valuable for two human context understanding tasks: current human activity recognition and future human activity prediction. In particular, we show that models trained solely with simulated data can give reasonable predictions about real situations occurring in the original dataset. We also report experimental results regarding statistical analysis and C2ST to assess the credibility of generated data. We discuss the generality of our approach for evaluating the credibility of simulated data from their use as training data."
10.1145/3665939.3665963,CopycHats: Question Sequencing with Artificial Agents,"Schema Matching, the task of finding correspondences among attributes of different schemata, plays an important role in data integration. The task has been extensively researched, leading to the development of multiple algorithmic approaches, many of which incorporate humans to some extent, by performing the matching, validating algorithmic solutions, or generating reliable ground truth for algorithms to be trained against. Human matching is a temporal process, in which previous decisions and ongoing cognitive processes influence future behavior. Therefore, planning a human matching task necessitates careful consideration, for example, the ordering of questions posed to the matcher. Various strategies exist for optimally choosing the sequence of matching questions and evaluating them may be limited by notable inherent human limitations. In this work, we propose to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to create artificial agents that emulate human agents in order to evaluate question sequencing strategies. We offer an alternative to traditional human-based evaluations, which overcome those limitations. We test our suggested evaluation framework and discuss the similarities and differences between artificial and human agents in the context of schema matching evaluation."
10.1145/3670998,Interpersonal Communication Interconnection in Media Convergence Metaverse,"The metaverse aims to provide immersive virtual worlds connecting with the physical world. To enable real-time interpersonal communications between users across the globe, the metaverse places high demands on network performance, including low latency, high bandwidth, and fast network speeds. This paper proposes a novel Media Convergence Metaverse Network (MCMN) framework to address these challenges. Specifically, the META controller serves as MCMN's logically centralized control plane, responsible for holistic orchestration across edge sites and end-to-end path computation between metaverse users. We develop a model-free deep reinforcement learning-based metaverse traffic optimization algorithm that learns to route flows while satisfying the Quality of Service (QoS) boundaries. The network slicing engine leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to create isolated, customized virtual networks tailored for metaverse traffic dynamics on demand. It employs unsupervised and reinforcement learning techniques using network telemetry from the META controller to understand application traffic patterns and train cognitive slicer agents to make quality of service -aware decisions accordingly. Optimized delivery of diverse concurrent media types necessitates routing intelligence to meet distinct requirements while mitigating clashes over a shared infrastructure. Media-aware routing enhances traditional shortest-path approaches by combining topological metrics with workflow sensitivities. We realize an edge-assisted rendering fabric to offload complex processing from bandwidth-constrained endpoints while retaining visual realism. Extensive simulations demonstrate MCMN's superior performance compared to conventional networking paradigms. MCMN shows great promise to enable seamless interconnectivity and ultra-high fidelity communications to unlock the true potential of the metaverse."

However, the systems of the governments are very different and even within a country there are distinctions between the federal, state, local and agency levels according to their specific context and capabilities. Among the governmental systems, electronic procurement is critical as they are related to a significant part of public spending. The purpose of this paper is to describe an assessment of the current state of digitization of procurement processes of innovative governments to deduce components of a common architecture from their best practices experiences that can be utilized for benchmark evaluation. This study employed an Action Design Research approach to identify, stakeholders, processes, system applications, technological components, and standards of a generic architecture for e-procurement. As a result, it was possible to deduce from countries implemented cases and validate through an organization benchmarking action case a generic architecture with four main system components: (1) e-planning of government procurement, (2) e-selection of suppliers, and (3) e-provisioning of goods and services from suppliers (4) e-services to citizens. The most developed component in government cases is e-selection, however, further developments should be carried out in e-planning and e-provisioning, mainly the integration with e-services. This work demonstrates how management research can create references for digital transformation. As a practical implication, the architectural model provides professionals with a tool for benchmark assessments, for decision-make on the evolution of functionalities and system requirements for government e-procurement."

We present the architecture of the integrated LLM-simulation system, demonstrate the initial results, and discuss the challenges of the current approach, related to LLM's understanding of spatial information and spatial relationships, their reasoning capabilities, and model performance and scalability."
10.1145/3689218.3689233,The Application of the LSTM Neural Networks on the Hydrology Forecast,"In this research, we utilize the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast water flows at various reservoir sites. Utilizing historical meteorological data, we forecast the flow volumes for the following 30 hours based on the data from the first 15 hours. Our approach involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and performance evaluation. Results indicate promising accuracy in flow prediction across multiple sites. Accurate streamflow forecasting is essential for effective water resource management and flood resilience planning. Traditional numerical models often face limitations in computational efficiency and inability to fully capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics of hydrological systems. With the recent advancements in deep learning, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, there is an opportunity to enhance streamflow predictions. This paper explores the application of LSTM networks for hourly streamflow forecasting at multiple catchments in the United States. Leveraging extensive, near-real-time hydrological and meteorological data from agencies such as the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the study develops an LSTM-based model to predict water flow. The model integrates historical data on temperature, precipitation, and flow measurements, and is trained to forecast streamflow at hourly intervals. Results demonstrate that the LSTM model effectively captures temporal dependencies, outperforming traditional methods. This study highlights the potential of LSTM networks to provide accurate and computationally efficient streamflow predictions, contributing to improved water management and flood forecasting capabilities. Future research directions include the incorporation of additional features and the exploration of advanced neural network architectures to further enhance prediction performance."
10.1145/3689933.3690834,Automated APT Defense Using Reinforcement Learning and Attack Graph Risk-based Situation Awareness,"Advanced Persistent Threats pose significant risks to communication and infrastructure systems. While both heuristic and reinforcement learning have been applied to address this challenge, current approaches rely on fixed assumptions or use simplistic state representations and reward functions, compromising adaptability and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel intelligent agent system that enhances security against APTs by leveraging MulVAL attack graphs and quantitative risk assessment. Our approach translates complex MulVAL attack graph states into a compact RL state representation, enabling efficient learning in dynamic network environments. We integrate quantitative attack graph-based risk assessment into the RL framework, employing a hybrid reward function that incorporates residual risk, risk reduction, control efficacy, and cost. This risk-based approach provides enhanced context and situation awareness to the RL agent, facilitating more informed long-term decision-making. Using both Q-learning and Proximal Policy Optimization algorithms, we train and evaluate our system on an emulated industrial control system environment under realistic APT attacks. Experimental results demonstrate the significant benefits of our risk-based approach in guiding RL agents. Compared to non-risk configurations, our method shows improved success rates in APT mitigation, reduced control costs, which imply better long-term strategic planning."

10.1145/3696410.3714765,Division-of-Thoughts: Harnessing Hybrid Language Model Synergy for Efficient On-Device Agents,"The rapid expansion of web content has made on-device AI assistants indispensable for helping users manage the increasing complexity of online tasks. The emergent reasoning ability in large language models offer a promising path for next-generation on-device AI agents. However, deploying full-scale Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource-limited local devices is challenging. In this paper, we propose <u>D</u>ivision-<u>o</u> f-<u>T</u>houghts (DoT), a collaborative reasoning framework leveraging the synergy between locally deployed Smaller-scale Language Models (SLMs) and cloud-based LLMs. DoT leverages a Task Decomposer to elicit the inherent planning abilities in language models to decompose user queries into smaller sub-tasks, which allows hybrid language models to fully exploit their respective strengths. Besides, DoT employs a Task Scheduler to analyze the pair-wise dependency of sub-tasks and create a dependency graph, facilitating parallel reasoning of sub-tasks and the identification of key steps. To allocate the appropriate model based on the difficulty of sub-tasks, DoT leverages a Plug-and-Play Adapter, which is an additional task head attached to the SLM that does not alter the SLM's parameters. To boost adapter's task allocation capability, we propose a self-reinforced training method that relies solely on task execution feedback. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that our DoT significantly reduces LLM costs while maintaining competitive reasoning accuracy. Specifically, DoT reduces the average reasoning time and API costs by 66.12\% and 83.57\%, while achieving comparable reasoning accuracy with the best baseline methods."

However, challenges such as limited advisor availability can hinder effective support. Generative AI, particularly AI-powered chatbots, offers the potential to enhance student advising in higher education by providing personalized guidance. These technologies help college students find the information and resources needed to create degree plans aligned with their academic goals. This research introduces ARGObot, an intelligent advising system that facilitates student navigation of university policies through automated interpretation of the student handbook as its primary knowledge base. ARGObot enhances accessibility to critical academic policies and procedures, supporting incoming students' success through personalized guidance. Our system integrates a multifunctional agent enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM). The architecture employs multiple external tools to enhance its capabilities: a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system accesses verified university sources; email integration facilitates Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) interaction; and a web search function expands the system's knowledge base beyond predefined constraints. This approach enables the system to provide contextually relevant and verified responses to various student queries. This architecture evolved from our initial implementation based on Gemini 1 Pro, which revealed significant limitations due to its lack of agent-based functionality, resulting in hallucination issues and irrelevant responses. Subsequent evaluation demonstrated that our enhanced version, integrating GPT-4 with the text-embedding-ada-002 model, achieved superior performance across all metrics. This paper also presents a comparative analysis of both implementations, highlighting the architectural improvements and their impact on system performance."

10.1145/3701716.3715247,"Meta-Agent-Workflow: Streamlining Tool Usage in LLMs through Workflow Construction, Retrieval, and Refinement","Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown significant advancements and are increasingly used as key components in automated agents for various web-based tasks. Typically, this agentization is achieved by carefully prompting LLMs to guide their behavior in using tools for specific tasks. However, this approach can be limited by the complexity of tasks and the inherent capabilities of LLMs. To enhance task-specific performance, a pre-defined workflow approach can be employed, reducing repetitive and error-prone planning for particular tasks. This workflow-driven process is especially well-suited for industrial applications, where task-specific agents can be easily configured using visual interfaces supported by various open-source platforms. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called Meta-Agent-Workflowto create, retrieve, and refine agent workflows. Experiments on ToolBench demonstrate that our framework effectively transforms LLM tool-reasoning processes into task-specific workflows, retrieves workflows for different tasks based on various queries, and updates them based on execution feedback. We also open-source our code and follow the workflow architecture of an open-source agent platform (e.g., Dify) to facilitate further industrial and community use. The Meta-Agent-Workflow will be open-sourced in https://github.com/testlbin/meta_agent_workflows."

Traditional Rubik's Cube robots, relying on complex vision systems and fixed algorithms, often struggle to adapt to complex and dynamic scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we introduce CubeRobot, a novel vision-language model (VLM) tailored for solving 3x3 Rubik's Cubes, empowering embodied agents with multimodal understanding and execution capabilities. We used the CubeCoT image dataset, which contains multiple-level tasks (43 subtasks in total) that humans are unable to handle, encompassing various cube states. We incorporate a dual-loop VisionCoT architecture and Memory Stream, a paradigm for extracting task-related features from VLM-generated planning queries, thus enabling CubeRobot to independent planning, decision-making, reflection and separate management of high- and low-level Rubik's Cube tasks. Furthermore, in low-level Rubik's Cube restoration tasks, CubeRobot achieved a high accuracy rate of 100\%, similar to 100\% in medium-level tasks, and achieved an accuracy rate of 80\% in high-level tasks."

The system uses a modular approach to natural language understanding and task execution, utilizing specialized agents for query processing. Our system features a Multi-Agent Block that consists of agents for general inquiries, Text2SQL, visualization, and information consolidation. These agents work together to handle complex queries. The Answer Generation component then integrates these results into coherent responses. We demonstrate our system’s efficiency using a complex query processed by a Text2SQL agent. In this scenario, the agent interacts with multiple endpoints, including an enterprise database and LLM endpoints, while employing techniques like RISE (Recursive Introspection for Results Improvements) and STaR (Self-Taught Reasoner) to enhance reasoning. Additionally, we use an open-source utility, LLMLingua, to compress prompts and reduce computational overhead.

10.1145/3704919,Model-checking Strategic Abilities in Information-sharing Systems,"We introduce a subclass of concurrent game structures (CGS) with imperfect information in which agents are endowed with private data-sharing capabilities. Importantly, our CGSs are such that it is still decidable to model-check these CGSs against a relevant fragment of ATL. These systems can be thought as a generalization of architectures allowing information forks, that is, cases where strategic abilities lead to certain agents outside a coalition privately sharing information with selected agents inside that coalition. Moreover, in our case, in the initial states of the system, we allow information forks from agents outside a given set  (A)  to agents inside this group (A) . For this reason, together with the fact that the communication in our models underpins a specialized form of broadcast, we call our formalism  (A)  -cast systems. To underline, the fragment of ATL for which we show the model-checking problem to be decidable over  (A) -cast is a large and significant one; it expresses coalitions over agents in any subset of the set  (A) . Indeed, as we show, our systems and this ATL fragments can encode security problems that are notoriously hard to express faithfully: terrorist-fraud attacks in identity schemes."

Building on the potential of LLMs to generate coherent narratives with commonsense reasoning, we contribute Jupybara, an AI-enabled assistant for actionable EDA and storytelling implemented as a Jupyter Notebook extension. Jupybara employs two strategies—design-space-aware prompting and multi-agent architectures—to operationalize our design space. An expert evaluation confirms Jupybara’s usability, steerability, explainability, and reparability, as well as the effectiveness of our strategies in operationalizing the design space framework with LLMs."

In this work, we survey existing methodologies to introduce ToM in Human-Robot Interaction, focusing on two main formalizations: Cognitive ToM, focusing on reasoning about beliefs and intentions in a more task oriented way, and Affective ToM, which requires the agent to recognize and adapt to others’ emotional states. While both approaches have advanced robot adaptability and user engagement, they are often developed in isolation. For this reason, we will discuss the need for integrated models that combine cognitive and affective reasoning, and outline future directions for more socially intelligent and emotionally aware robotic systems."

While these extract precise hidden patterns in motion data, they are often task-specific and lack a semantic understatement of motion. Symbolic systems that mirror human cognition and explicit expressive processes are necessary for richer motion synthesis and analysis, enabling physical reasoning and expert knowledge encoding. In this work, we propose a neurosymbolic framework that combines Labanotation and Laban Movement Analysis (LMA), originally developed for dance, to represent and analyze human motion symbolically. We expand the existing LabanEditor to support full-body annotation and integrate it with AMASS, Mediapipe, and Kinect inputs through a SMPL-based format. Our system supports automatic annotation for the local functional and expressive aspects of motion, and enables bidirectional conversion between symbols and motion. While still a work in progress, this framework lays the groundwork for explainable, expressive motion modeling that can support human-robot interaction, motion preservation, and psychomotor learning systems."

The primary challenge addressed is the efficient training of an RL agent to navigate mazes ranging from simple 17x17 grids to complex 263x263 grids. Our approach integrates curriculum learning to increase the complexity of mazes during training gradually and employs hybrid exploration strategies to balance exploration and exploitation effectively. Although the experiments were conducted in a simulated environment, the methods developed hold significant promise for real-world microrobot applications. We benchmarked our RL framework, which is built on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), against traditional pathfinding algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), A-star, and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). We trained our model on the subset of the ‘Curriculum - Lost in Maze Dataset,’ consisting of 3.1 million maze images, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize and efficiently solve unseen mazes. The model achieved an average loss of 12.67 across all maze sizes and adapted to new ones with an average time of 21.69. The proposed methodology results in significant improvements, with a 16.54\% increase in success rate and a 51.49\% improvement in path efficiency compared to the average of the two baseline methods. Our proposed approach potentially contributes to microrobot manipulation, where precise path planning is crucial for avoiding obstacles in real-time within a vision-based control system limited to a monocular top view by the optical microscope [1], [2], [3]."

Existing image database retrieval methods are limited by the impracticality of storing sufficient visual records of global landmarks. Recently, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated the capability of geo-localization through Visual Question Answering (VQA), enabling a solution that does not require external geo-tagged image records. However, the performance of a single LVLM is still limited by its intrinsic knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce smileGeo, a novel visual geo-localization framework that leverages multiple Internet-enabled LVLM agents operating within an agent-based architecture. By facilitating inter-agent communication, smileGeo integrates the inherent knowledge of these agents with additional retrieved information, enhancing the ability to effectively localize images. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a dynamic learning strategy that optimizes agent communication, reducing redundant interactions and enhancing overall system efficiency. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conducted experiments on three different datasets, and the results show that our approach significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

This article explores the transformative potential of integrating Large Language Models into Multi-Agent (LMA) systems for addressing complex challenges in software engineering (SE). By leveraging the collaborative and specialized abilities of multiple agents, LMA systems enable autonomous problem-solving, improve robustness, and provide scalable solutions for managing the complexity of real-world software projects. In this article, we conduct a systematic review of recent primary studies to map the current landscape of LMA applications across various stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). To illustrate current capabilities and limitations, we perform two case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art LMA frameworks.

10.1145/3712255.3734367,Evolvability in Rule-Making: A Self-Amendment Game Among LLM Agents,"We introduce the Self-Amendment Game, a simulation framework where Large Language Model (LLM) agents iteratively propose, vote on, and revise the very rules that govern them. Inspired by the self-modifying game Nomic, this system enables agents to operate within a fully amendable environment in which institutional constraints are themselves subject to change. Using leading LLMs, we examine two agent strategies: ""Add"" agents that focus on introducing new rules, and ""Modify"" agents that refine existing ones. Add agents tend to generate denser but less stable rule systems, with rapid point accumulation and high leadership turnover. Modify agents foster greater stability, with fewer but more consistent leaders. Analyzing the semantic structure of proposals, we find that varied justification styles often lead to instability, while coherence in reasoning promotes rule adoption. Our findings highlight a crucial trade-off between innovation and governance stability, offering a foundation for studying adaptive, self-governing systems involving both artificial agents and hybrid human-AI institutions."
10.1145/3712285.3759887,STELLAR: Storage Tuning Engine Leveraging LLM Autonomous Reasoning for High Performance Parallel File Systems,"I/O performance is crucial to efficiency in data-intensive scientific computing; but tuning large-scale storage systems is complex, costly, and notoriously manpower-intensive, making it inaccessible for most domain scientists. To address this problem, we propose STELLAR, an autonomous tuner for high-performance parallel file systems. Our evaluations show that STELLAR almost always selects near-optimal configurations for the parallel file systems within the first five attempts, even for previously unseen applications. STELLAR’s human-like efficiency is fundamentally different from existing autotuning methods, which often require hundreds of thousands of iterations to converge. STELLAR achieves this through autonomous end-to-end agentic tuning. Powered by large language models (LLMs), STELLAR is capable of (1) accurately extracting tunable parameters from software manuals, (2) analyzing I/O trace logs generated by applications, (3) selecting initial tuning strategies, (4) rerunning applications on real systems and collecting I/O performance feedback, (5) adjusting tuning strategies and repeating the tuning cycle, and (6) reflecting on and summarizing tuning experiences into reusable knowledge for future optimizations. STELLAR integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), external tool execution, LLM-based reasoning, and a multiagent design to stabilize reasoning and combat hallucinations. We evaluate how each of these components impacts optimization outcomes, thus providing insight into the design of similar systems for other optimization problems. STELLAR’s architecture and empirical validation open new avenues for tackling complex system optimization challenges, especially those characterized by vast search spaces and high exploration costs. Its highly efficient autonomous tuning will broaden access to I/O performance optimizations for domain scientists with minimal additional resource investment."
10.1145/3712672,A Cyber-War Between Bots: Cognitive Attackers are More Challenging for Defenders than Strategic Attackers,"Adversary emulation is commonly used to test cyber-defense performance against known threats to organizations. However, many adversary emulation methods often rely on automated planning and underplay the role of human cognition. Consequently, defenders are often underprepared for human attackers who can think creatively and adapt their strategies. In this article, we propose the design of adversarial cognitive agents that are dynamic, adaptable, and able to learn from experience. These cognitive agents are built based on the theoretical principles of Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT) of experiential choice in dynamic tasks, making them more challenging than strategically optimal adversaries for human defenders. Our research offers three main contributions. First, in a simulation experiment, we demonstrate how IBL attacker agents can learn from experience and become as efficient as optimal strategic algorithms against a strategic defender. In a second simulation experiment, the IBL attackers are pitted against an IBL defender, showing that the IBL attacker can be a more challenging adversary for the IBL defender, while the IBL defender can learn to counter carefully crafted optimal attack strategies. To test these observations, we conducted a third experiment, where humans played the role of defenders against both strategic and IBL attackers in an interactive task. The results confirm the predictions of the second simulation experiment: Cognitive attackers are more challenging for human defenders than strategic attackers. These insights contribute to informing future adversary emulation efforts and training of cyber defenders."

This study focuses on developing and evaluating algorithms for a low-power wearable infrared eye-tracking system conceived to work 24/7. The system includes a custom-built prototype that integrates infrared LEDs and photodiodes, strategically positioned on smart eyewear to estimate gaze direction. A humanoid robot, Ami Desktop, was utilized to create a controlled and robust dataset. Two deep learning architectures were investigated: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a tailored Hierarchical Neural Network (HNN). Variants of these models incorporating dimensionality reduction techniques were implemented to optimize performance and efficiency for low-power microcontrollers. The results demonstrate the superior accuracy and reasonable computational demands of the HNN models, highlighting their potential for continuous, real-time and portable eye-tracking applications."
10.1145/3715709,Thinking Fast and Slow in Human and Machine Intelligence,"When working to build machines that have a form of intelligence, it is natural to be inspired by human intelligence. Of course, humans are very different from machines, in their embodiment and myriad other ways. Humans exploit their bodies to experience the world, create an internal model of it, and use this model to reason, learn, and make contextual and informed decisions. Machines lack the same embodiment, but often have access to both more memory and more computing power. Despite these crucial disanalogies, it is still useful to leverage our knowledge of how the human mind reasons and makes decisions to design and build machines that demonstrate behaviors similar to that of a human. In this article, we present a novel AI architecture, Slow and Fast AI (SOFAI), that is inspired by the “thinking fast and slow” cognitive theory of human decision making. SOFAI is a multi-agent architecture that employs both “fast” and “slow” solvers underneath a metacognitive agent that is able to both choose among a set of solvers as well as reflect on and learn from past experience. Experimental results on the behavior of two instances of the SOFAI architecture show that, compared to using just one of the two decision modalities, SOFAI is markedly better in terms of decision quality, resource consumption, and efficiency.Modeling AI systems on dual-process theories of human cognition can improve their ability to flexibly handle diverse tasks."
10.1145/3715761,Integrating Large Language Models and Reinforcement Learning for Non-linear Reasoning,"Large Language Models (LLMs) were shown to struggle with long-term planning, which may be caused by the limited way in which they explore the space of possible solutions. We propose an architecture where a Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agent guides an LLM's space exploration: (1) the Agent has access to domain-specific information, and can therefore make decisions about the quality of candidate solutions based on specific and relevant metrics, which were not explicitly considered by the LLM's training objective; (2) the LLM can focus on generating immediate next steps, without the need for long-term planning. We allow non-linear reasoning by exploring alternative paths and backtracking. We evaluate this architecture on the program equivalence task, and compare it against Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT). We assess both the downstream task, denoting the binary classification, and the intermediate reasoning steps. Our approach compares positively against CoT and ToT."
10.1145/3716553.3750759,Using a Secondary Channel to Display the Internal Empathic Resonance of LLM-Driven Agents for Mental Health Support,"Conversational agents are becoming increasingly popular for digital mental health support. However, while empathy is essential for effective emotional support, the unimodal request-response interaction of such systems limits empathic communication. We address this limitation through a secondary channel that displays an agent’s inner reflections, similar to how nonverbal feedback in human interaction conveys cognitive and emotional states. We implemented a chatbot that generates not only conversational responses but also describes internal reasoning and emotional resonance. A user study involving N = 188 participants indicated a statistically significant increase in perceived empathy ( (+14.7\%) ) when the agent’s internal reflections were displayed. Our findings demonstrate a practical method to enhance empathic interaction with LLM-based chatbots in empathy-critical contexts. Additionally, this work opens possibilities for multimodal systems where LLM-generated reflections may serve as input for generating nonverbal feedback."
10.1145/3716553.3750771,A Multifaceted Multi-Agent Framework for Zero-Shot Emotion Analysis and Recognition of Symbolic Music,"This paper presents the first attempt at zero-shot music emotion recognition (MER) to map musical pieces, represented in symbolic formats (e.g., ABC notation), onto the valence-arousal space. Conventional MER approaches typically train an end-to-end deep neural network (DNN). However, the performance of such supervised methods is limited due to the multifaceted and ambiguous nature of music emotions, compounded by the scarcity of MER datasets. To address this, we leverage knowledge transfer from large language models (LLMs) pre-trained on vast text and symbolic data. We hypothesize that LLMs possess capabilities in low-level music description and high-level emotion reasoning (not necessarily in a musical context). Accordingly, we propose a multi-agent framework that performs zero-shot MER by associating objective musical attributes (harmony, melody, rhythm, and structure) with subjective attributes (valence and arousal). Our system employs a hierarchical architecture comprising (i) musical element descriptors, (ii) chain-of-thought emotion analysts, and (iii) comprehensive predictors. Knowledge injection and zero-shot prompting are utilized to mitigate inherent model biases. Evaluations on the EMOPIA dataset demonstrate that our system, built on the Gemini-2.0-Flash backbone, significantly outperforms baseline LLM models, including ultra-large models and mixture-of-experts (MoE) systems, and performs comparably to fully supervised or fine-tuned models."
10.1145/3717413.3717418,Utilizing Autonomous Airport Parking Facilities as Virtual Power Plants to Provide Frequency Containment Reserve,"With the rise of inverter-based renewables, grid stability is increasingly strained. Electric vehicles (EVs) offer unique potential in enhancing this stability through intelligent (dis-)charging control; by aggregation, they can provide significant balancing services to network operators. To exploit this opportunity, airport parking is particularly well suited due to the large number of vehicles with predictable departure times. By using the novel Automated Valet Charging (AVC) technology, parking facilities can optimally schedule EVs---autonomously maneuvering cars to and from charge points and connecting them robotically. We propose using AVC-capable parking facilities as virtual power plants (VPPs), providing fast-acting frequency containment reserve (FCR). This study's key contributions are: 1) presenting the AVC VPP concept and formalizing its two core optimization tasks, 2) developing a modular co-simulation architecture for comprehensive evaluation, 3) performing preliminary experiments, to assess feasibility and to identify simulation challenges, and 4) outlining strategic recommendations for practical AVC VPP implementation. The results suggest the concept's potential in utilizing airport EV parking for FCR, promising additional revenue for parking operators without sacrificing customer satisfaction. However, for conclusive assessment, extended simulation models are necessary. Furthermore, prequalification emerges as a significant obstacle to profitable real-world applications. Ultimately, AVC VPPs may help with transforming EVs from being a burden on the grid to a valuable asset."
10.1145/3717511.3747067,"BEE: Belief-Value-Aligned, Explainable, and Extensible Cognitive Framework for Conversational Agents","Recent advances in large language models have enabled virtual agents to exhibit increasingly believable social behaviors. However, creating social agents that remain consistent with a defined profile and explain their reasoning remains challenging. We introduce a cognitive framework designed to address these gaps. Our framework features a graph-based memory module (concept pool) and a decision-making process inspired by human cognition. The concept pool contains an agent’s beliefs, values, and background stories for context-dependent retrieval. The decision-making process uses the concept pool to produce belief-value aligned responses of the virtual agent and intuitive, human-readable explanations of the reasoning. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we created two virtual agents based on historical figures and compared them to baseline agents. Our evaluation combined quantitative assessments of belief-value alignment with a user study (n=48) examining explainable agency. Results show that our framework exhibits model-agnostic improved belief-value alignment and produces more detailed, relevant, and understandable explanations. By grounding virtual agent behavior in structured memories and cognitive principles, our framework offers a compelling step toward more coherent and socially intelligent virtual agents."
10.1145/3723498.3723702,Evaluating Large Language Models through Communication Games: An Agent-Based Framework Using Werewolf in Unity,"In this study, we explore the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the context of the social communication game Werewolf, aiming to evaluate their performance in managing complex system states commonly found in computer games. Our agent architecture gathers data, refines them into detailed information, and plans actions based on this knowledge. To demonstrate the feasibility of using LLM based agents in computer games, we developed a simulation and evaluation tool using the Unity game engine. This software enables users to experiment with various LLMs and agent architectures and to measure model performance within the application.For evaluation, we tested three models: GPT-3.5 Turbo, Mistral-7B-OpenOrca, and Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13B. The results show that even smaller models can perform reasonably well in Werewolf. However, their error rate is significantly higher, highlighting the need for additional software modules or fine-tuning to improve their accuracy."
10.1145/3725783.3764388,Between Promise and Pain: The Reality of Automating Failure Analysis in Microservices with LLMs,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as general-purpose assistants for infrastructure operations, helping automate tasks like querying data, analyzing logs, and suggesting fixes. In this paper, we consider the more general and ambitious problem of fully automating root cause analysis (RCA) in microservice systems, where LLMs must collect information, reason about it, and interact with the environment to detect, localize and resolve issues. Anecdotal evidence offers useful insights and partial solutions, but the broader challenge remains unresolved. We systematically evaluate multiple LLM agent architectures across a range of incident scenarios. We study how different tool-augmented agents perform, and shed light on common failure modes, including hallucinated reasoning paths and inefficient use of context. Our findings reveal both the promise and the limitations of current approaches, and point to concrete directions for more robust and effective use of LLMs in this domain."
10.1145/3728725.3728759,A Guided-learning Network for Brain Tumor Segmentation with Missing Modalities,"Accurate segmentation of brain tumors is essential for clinical assessment and treatment planning, as it leverages multiple MRI modalities to provide complementary diagnostic information. However, missing modalities are frequently en- countered in clinical practice due to factors such as image degradation, artifacts, protocol inconsistencies, or patient con- traindications to contrast agents. While certain unified models are designed to accommodate various missing modality scenarios, their performance declines markedly when multiple modalities are absent, particularly in cases where only a single modality is available. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a Guided- learning Network that leverages dynamic FFT filters. This network trains multiple specialized models designed for different missing modality scenarios, achieving outstanding performance. The architecture comprises two distinct learning paths: one dedicated to capturing multimodal information and another focused on generating modality-specific representations for the missing modality. A guided-learning strategy connects these two paths. Initially, the multimodal path is trained and its parameters are locked, enabling the missing modality path to learn under its guidance. The training process incorporates several key com- ponents: adversarial learning to align high-level features across paths, frequency-domain adaptive filtering using dynamic FFT filters to extract global features, and mutual information transfer to ensure critical information is retained even when modality data is missing. Experiments conducted on the BraTS2018 dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms comparable state-of- the-art methods in all missing modality cases."
10.1145/3730824,Learning to Assemble with Alternative Plans,"We present a reinforcement learning framework for constructing assemblies composed of rigid parts, which are commonly seen in many historical masonry buildings and bridges. Traditional construction methods for such structures often depend on dense scaffolding to stabilize their intermediate assembly steps, making the process both labor-intensive and time-consuming. This work utilizes multiple robots to collaboratively assemble structures, offering temporary support by holding parts in place without additional scaffolding. Precomputing the robotic assembly process to ensure structural stability involves a time-consuming offline process due to the combinatorial nature of its search space. However, the precomputed assembly plans may get disrupted during real-world execution due to unforeseen changes, such as setup modifications or delays in part delivery. Recomputing these plans using traditional offline methods results in significant project delays. Therefore, we propose a reinforcement learning-based approach in which a neural network is trained to efficiently generate alternative assembly plans for a given structure online, enabling adaptation to external changes. To enable effective and efficient training, we introduce three key innovations: a GPU-based stability simulator for parallelizing simulations, a novel curriculum-based training scheme to address sparse rewards during training, and a new graph neural network architecture for efficiently encoding assembly geometry. We validate our approach by training reinforcement learning agents on various assemblies and evaluating their performance on unseen assembly tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in planning multi-robot assembly processes, effectively handling disruptions in both simulation and physical environments."
10.1145/3731599.3767401,Agentic AI vs ML-based Autotuning: A Comparative Study for Loop Reordering Optimization,"High Performance Computing (HPC) applications rely heavily on code optimizations to achieve good performance on modern CPU and GPU architectures. Traditional Machine Learning autotuning approaches have demonstrated success in exploring high-dimensional spaces, but they often require expensive compile-run evaluations and lack adaptability for large HPC applications. The recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Agentic AI systems raise intriguing questions about the potential of these approaches to address specific optimization methodologies. This work aims to answer an essential question for the HPC community: ""How Agentic AI Systems Compare to Traditional ML Autotuning Techniques?"" To address this question, we present a comparative analysis between a traditional ML-based optimization approach and an Agentic AI system, evaluating their respective capabilities and limitations for loop-level optimization. In addition, we introduced a new Agentic AI system named LoopGen-AI using three different Large Language Models: GPT-4.1, Claude 4.0, and Gemini 2.5. A key finding is that LoopGen-AI achieves competitive performance with only a few program runs, the reasoning logs from the agents revealed that their decisions rely heavily on the combination of semantic understanding of the target kernel with dynamic feedback from the environment, highlighting a promising new dimension in performance tuning. In contrast, ML-based autotuners focus on statistical exploration, and require orders of magnitude more runs to reach peak performance. Additionally, our analysis shows that prompt engineering, particularly using Persona + Context Manager patterns, significantly impacts the effectiveness of Agentic AI. Our results indicate that while Agentic AI systems are not yet a complete replacement for ML-based autotuners, it can effectively complement traditional methods."
10.1145/3731715.3733393,MMCNav: MLLM-empowered Multi-agent Collaboration for Outdoor Visual Language Navigation,"Navigating through real-world environments, such as urban street views, poses a significant challenge for agents searching for a clear path to the destination based on environmental information. Although existing methods leveraging large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable achievements, they often struggle to tackle scenarios that require complex visual understanding. Inspired by the classical perception-cognition-action feedback loop in cognitive neuroscience, we present a multimodal large language models (MLLMs) empowered multi-agent collaborative outdoor navigation system that significantly enhances the capability to accomplish outdoor navigation tasks by extending a single agent into multiple cooperative agents. Each agent assumes a specific role in this system and collaborates to perform their respective tasks effectively. The system begins with agents interpreting human-written navigation instructions into detailed plans. At each step of the plan, agents analyze and caption the multimodal scenarios to improve their understanding of the environment. Then agents determine the search direction based on observational captions and historical decisions. At the end of the navigation, agents adopt the map of the search process to perform a two-stage reflection for error correction. Comprehensive experiments and analyses conducted on two outdoor navigation datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, outperforming previous methods in terms of performance. The repository of this project is available at https://github.com/zzhaesc/MMCNav."
10.1145/3733155.3733196,Assistive Robots for Older Adults: A Human-Robot Interaction Study,"The progressive population ageing is rapidly transforming our societies. Assistive robots become an opportunity to favour the ageing in place allowing elderlies to remain in the home environment while increasing safety, healthy lifestyles, and remote monitoring for facilitating early intervention in an emergency. The present pilot work aims to compare two different human-robot interactions based on both usability and user-experience standardized scales and semi-structured interviews administered to a group of 10 elderly people to identify the factors affecting technology acceptance. The use of two different robots based on touch screen (Temi) and oral communication (Ohmni) equipped with specific sensors is investigated in four different scenarios with both clinical and social purposes: cognitive stimulation, nutritional control, physiological parameters monitoring, and entertainment. The study's findings report that the initial distrust in innovative and unusual technologies may be reduced by approaching them in a controlled environment. However, the perception of the usefulness and usability of robots, and more generally of technology, is also influenced by the personal nature of the user and the reason for use. Indeed, robots appear to be a threat to older adults’ independence, especially those who stay fit and behave independently. Concerning the robots’ interaction modes, most users preferred a combined interaction based on both vocal and written communication to make up for hearing or visual problems. Moreover, a robot exhibiting both a static and dynamic mode was preferred. However, further studies should be devoted to the optimization of the adopted technologies considering the users’ feedback for improved adaptivity and technology acceptance."
10.1145/3733155.3733211,Indoor Turn-By-Turn Navigation Assistance for Robotic Rollators,"Navigating indoor environments poses significant challenges for individuals with mobility and cognitive impairments, impacting their independence and quality of life. While robotic rollators have shown potential in providing mobility assistance, existing systems often rely on static navigation approaches that lack a capacity to dynamically adapt to path changes and unforeseen deviations. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a dynamic turn-by-turn navigation system designed to provide real-time, user-centered guidance. The system aims to enhance spatial orientation and wayfinding through online dynamic planning, addressing critical limitations of current solutions. We present results from user trials in a simulated environment, which show its potential to improve mobility. Possible areas of improvement are also discussed, paving the way for more effective assistive technologies in real-world settings."
10.1145/3744333.3747807,Enhancing Passenger Trust Toward Cooperative Autonomous Vehicles Using Simulated Augmented Reality Displays,"Adoption of Fully Autonomous Vehicles (FAVs) depends on trust, which is defined as confidence in a vehicle’s dependability, safety, and predictability. In cooperative driving scenarios, trust must exceed ego vehicles to include other autonomous vehicles and their coordination. This is challenged by unexpected multi-agent interactions, diminishing human control, and limited system transparency. We hypothesize that enhancing transparency by providing information about ego vehicle, other cooperative vehicles, and road conditions can foster trust. This is achieved by visualizing vehicle-to-everything (V2X) information via augmented reality (AR) interfaces. To test this in a safe environment, we conducted a within-subjects experiment in a Virtual Reality (VR) driving simulator with AR overlays. Participants experienced three interface concepts: (A) no transparency, (B) system-level transparency (ego vehicle intentions only), and (C) environment-level transparency (cooperation intentions, planned paths, and infrastructure). Results show that environment-level transparency, despite the higher cognitive workload, enhanced trust in both ego and cooperating FAVs."
10.1145/3744464.3744491,Design of Robot Single Conveyor Double Sided Multi Layer Handling and Stacking Control System,"The robot handling and palletizing control system is widely used in industries such as box packaging processing and logistics. The handling and palletizing control system can assist packaging production lines in achieving rapid handling and palletizing of boxes, facilitating subsequent transportation and processing of boxes. At present, the handling and palletizing control system is mainly aimed at the application of unidirectional palletizing layout in single conveyor production lines. The efficiency of handling and palletizing is low, and its control algorithm is complex, with many repeated trajectories, which makes it difficult to speed up the system operation and has a significant impact on the production and processing output of box bodies. Using robotstudio software, a control system for single conveyor line handling and double-sided multi-layer palletizing based on robot control is designed to meet the needs of real production line box handling and palletizing. By building a structured handling and palletizing control algorithm architecture, simplifying the layout of handling and palletizing workstations, optimizing the handling and palletizing process, the efficiency of robot motion trajectory planning is improved, and problems such as low intelligence level, low production efficiency, and cumbersome robot operation trajectory of handling and palletizing production lines are solved."

It can automate complex tasks and effectively empower various business scenarios. Single AI Agent flexible and diverse deployment, multi-AI Agent innovative interaction and collaboration, multi-AI Agent collaboration improves the autonomy of the intelligent system by integrating the capabilities of single AI Agent. This paper provides an overview of multi-AI Agent from four aspects. Firstly, the core capabilities of AI Agent were outlined, and multi-AI Agent collaboration was introduced and its characteristics were analyzed.

10.1145/3745778.3766664,Frustration-driven Snap-through in Snapology,"We propose a transformable modular system based on Snapology, a modular origami assembled with prismatic foldable modules connected by foldable hinges. Our Snapology system specifically employs rhombic and regular triangular modules, with all creases constrained to a single fold direction (valley or mountain). The key finding lies in exploiting geometric frustration — the inability of the system to satisfy all geometric constraints simultaneously — to achieve rapid transformation from planar to three-dimensional (3D) configurations through snapping motion. The transformation principle is programmable by controlling the activation of out-of-plane fold hinges incident on a single vertex, enabling two distinct motions: smooth motion and snapping motion. We develop kinematic models to analyze configuration spaces and elucidate the underlying transformation principles. Computational modeling and prototype fabrication validate the predicted snapping behaviors. Design explorations demonstrate various system configurations that achieve programmable 2D-to-3D transformations through controlled snapping motion. This work establishes a new paradigm for frustration-driven modular origami design, with applications in programmable matter, soft robotics, and adaptive architectural systems."
10.1145/3746027.3754542,InteractGuide: LLM-Enhanced Multimodal Reasoning for User-Centric Interaction Recommendations in AR-HRI Authoring,"Augmented Reality (AR) enhances Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) by offering diverse interaction methods. However, existing systems often fail to resolve the conflict between a user's implicit preferences and physical ergonomics, leading to suboptimal experiences. We introduce InteractGuide, a novel framework that, for the first time, uses a Large Language Model (LLM) as a central reasoning engine to dynamically balance these competing factors. Our system translates physiological signals into a symbolic ''Preference Memory'' that the LLM reasons over, alongside real-time ergonomic and contextual data, to provide personalized interaction recommendations. A 29-participant study confirms our architecture improves efficiency and experience compared to single-factor approaches, showing the potential of LLMs as reasoning engines for complex AR-HRI. This work presents a validated end-to-end architecture for user-centric interaction adaptation, demonstrating the potential of LLMs as reasoning engines in complex AR-HRI systems."
10.1145/3746027.3754761,HM-RAG: Hierarchical Multi-Agent Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation,"While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) augments Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge, conventional single-agent RAG remains fundamentally limited in resolving complex queries demanding coordinated reasoning across heterogeneous data ecosystems. We present HM-RAG, a novel Hierarchical Multi-agent Multimodal RAG framework that pioneers collaborative intelligence for dynamic knowledge synthesis across structured, unstructured, and graph-based data. The framework is composed of a three-tiered architecture with specialized agents: a Decomposition Agent that dissects complex queries into contextually coherent sub-tasks via semantic-aware query rewriting and schema-guided context augmentation; Multi-source Retrieval Agents that carry out parallel, modality-specific retrieval using plug-and-play modules designed for vector, graph, and web-based databases; and a Decision Agent that uses consistency voting to integrate multi-source answers and resolve discrepancies in retrieval results through Expert Model Refinement. This architecture attains comprehensive query understanding by combining textual, graph-relational, and web-derived evidence, resulting in a remarkable 12.95\% improvement in answer accuracy and a 3.56\% boost in question classification accuracy over baseline RAG systems on the ScienceQA and CrisisMMD benchmarks. Notably, HM-RAG establishes state-of-the-art results in zero-shot settings on both datasets. Its modular architecture ensures seamless integration of new data modalities while maintaining strict data governance, marking a significant advancement in addressing the critical challenges of multimodal reasoning and knowledge synthesis in RAG systems."
10.1145/3746027.3755425,From Model Diagram to Code: A Benchmark Dataset and Multi-Agent Framework,"Model Diagram-to-Code Generation aims to translate model diagrams from research papers into implementation code that reconstructs the model's architecture. This task plays a crucial role in accelerating scientific workflows and enhancing the efficiency of industrial model deployment. While recent studies have explored various Image-to-Code Generation tasks using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), these efforts have primarily focused on reconstructing the visual appearance depicted in input images, leaving this task largely underexplored. The complex structural elements and implicit relationships in model diagrams present greater challenges for MLLMs, particularly in terms of visual reasoning and semantic interpretation. To support this task, we introduce MDCDataset, a dataset designed to evaluate the ability of MLLMs to generate code from model diagrams. It comprises 1,008 instances spanning 16 research domains, each with a model diagram, structured textual content, and the ground-truth code implementation. Furthermore, to address the inherent challenges of this task, we propose MDCAgent, a collaborative multi-agent framework composed of Parsing, Generation, and Check Agents. These agents work in coordination to analyze, extract, and verify complex elements and implicit relationships within model diagrams, thereby enhancing the visual architecture-aware reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Our extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the framework."
10.1145/3746027.3755537,GraphVideoAgent: Enhancing Long-form Video Understanding with Entity Relation Graphs,"Long-form video understanding (LVU) addresses the challenge of answering complex questions over extended video length, where informative cues are sparse and easily overwhelmed by redundant content. To tackle this, it requires selecting a small set of question-relevant keyframes and reasoning over long-range, temporally dispersed visual evidence. However, current methods typically extract frame-level features with limited temporal context and store them in sequential memory structures. As a result, they struggle to capture the evolving relations among entities and fail to maintain identity consistency when entities temporarily leave and later reappear in the video. These limitations prevent accurate keyframe localization and coherent reasoning.In this paper, we propose GraphVideoAgent, a novel agent-based LVU framework that integrates a dynamic entity relation graph with a large language model (LLM)-based multi-round reasoning. Our framework emulates human cognitive strategies by iteratively retrieving keyframes and explicitly tracking both temporal and semantic interactions among entities. Our GraphVideoAgent iteratively reflects on question cues and visual observations, while the graph memory maintains a structured representation of evolving entity states and their causal relations. This design enables accurate keyframe selection, effective reasoning over sparse visual evidence, and interpretable prediction. Extensive experiments on two LVU benchmarks, EgoSchema and NExT-QA, demonstrate that GraphVideoAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance while using only 8.2 and 8.1 frames on average, significantly improving both accuracy and efficiency."
10.1145/3746027.3755643,The Eye of Sherlock Holmes: Uncovering User Private Attribute Profiling via Vision-Language Model Agentic Framework,"Our research reveals a new privacy risk associated with the vision language model (VLM) agentic framework: the ability to infer sensitive attributes (e.g., age and health information) and even abstract ones (e.g., personality and social traits) from a set of personal images, which we term ''image private attribute profiling.'' This threat is particularly severe given that modern apps can easily access users' photo albums, and inference from image sets enables models to exploit inter-image relations for more sophisticated profiling. However, two main challenges hinder our understanding of how well VLMs can profile an individual from a few personal photos: (1) the lack of benchmark datasets with multi-image annotations for private attributes, and (2) the limited ability of current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to infer abstract attributes from large image collections. In this work, we construct PAPI, the largest dataset for studying private attribute profiling in personal images, comprising 2,510 images from 251 individuals with 3,012 annotated privacy attributes. We also propose HolmesEye, a hybrid agentic framework that combines VLMs and LLMs to enhance privacy inference. HolmesEye uses VLMs to extract both intra-image and inter-image information and LLMs to guide the inference process as well as consolidate the results through forensic analysis, overcoming existing limitations in long-context visual reasoning. Experiments reveal that HolmesEye achieves a 10.8\% improvement in average accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines and surpasses human-level performance by 15.0\% in predicting abstract attributes. This work highlights the urgency of addressing privacy risks in image-based profiling and offers both a new dataset and an advanced framework to guide future research in this area."
10.1145/3746027.3755832,CogDDN: A Cognitive Demand-Driven Navigation with Decision Optimization and Dual-Process Thinking,"Mobile robots are increasingly required to navigate and interact within unknown and unstructured environments to meet human demands. Demand-driven navigation (DDN) enables robots to identify and locate objects based on implicit human intent, even when object locations are unknown. However, traditional data-driven DDN methods rely on pre-collected data for model training and decision-making, limiting their generalization capability in unseen scenarios. In this paper, we propose CogDDN, a VLM-based framework that emulates the human cognitive and learning mechanisms by integrating fast and slow thinking systems and selectively identifying key objects essential to fulfilling user demands. CogDDN identifies appropriate target objects by semantically aligning detected objects with the given instructions. Furthermore, it incorporates a dual-process decision-making module, comprising a Heuristic Process for rapid, efficient decisions and an Analytic Process that analyzes past errors, accumulates them in a knowledge base, and continuously improves performance. Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning strengthens the decision-making process. Extensive closed-loop evaluations on the AI2Thor simulator with the ProcThor dataset show that CogDDN outperforms single-view camera-only methods by 15\%, demonstrating significant improvements in navigation accuracy and adaptability.

10.1145/3746027.3758167,MindFuse: Towards GenAI Explainability in Marketing Strategy Co-Creation,"The future of digital marketing lies in the convergence of human creativity and generative AI, where insight, strategy, and storytelling are co-authored by intelligent systems. We present MindFuse, a brave new explainable generative AI framework designed to act as a strategic partner in the marketing process. Unlike conventional LLM applications that stop at content generation, MindFuse fuses CTR-based content AI-guided co-creation with large language models to extract, interpret, and iterate on communication narratives grounded in real advertising data. MindFuse operates across the full marketing lifecycle: from distilling content pillars and customer personas from competitor campaigns to recommending in-flight optimizations based on live performance telemetry. It uses attention-based explainability to diagnose ad effectiveness and guide content iteration, while aligning messaging with strategic goals through dynamic narrative construction and storytelling. We introduce a new paradigm in GenAI for marketing, where LLMs not only generate content but reason through it, adapt campaigns in real time, and learn from audience engagement patterns. Our results, validated in agency deployments, demonstrate up to 12\texttimes{} efficiency gains, setting the stage for future integration with empirical audience data (e.g., GWI, Nielsen) and full-funnel attribution modeling. MindFuse redefines AI not just as a tool, but as a collaborative agent in the creative and strategic fabric of modern marketing. In the end of the paper, we also provide a forward-looking forecast on how platforms like MindFuse and Google DeepMind's ACAI are likely to shape the future of marketing agencies. These systems will not only reset client expectations toward greater transparency, speed, and personalization, but will also redefine the skillsets demanded from the new generation of marketers. As hybrid agencies emerge-blending creative storytelling with data science and AI engineering-the competitive landscape will increasingly hinge on talent. In this new environment, professionals will be expected to pair human imagination with technical fluency, while agencies will need to reinvent themselves as AI facilitators and curators of brand authenticity amidst the ongoing talent war led by platforms such as Meta."
10.1145/3746027.3762011,Agent-MER: A Cognitive Agent with Hierarchical Deliberation for Open-Vocabulary Multimodal Emotion Recognition,"This paper focuses on Open-Vocabulary Multimodal Emotion Recognition (OV-MER) and is dedicated to solving the two challenges it faces: concept semantic misalignment and incomplete coverage of fine-grained emotion categories. To address this, we propose a novel cognitive agent framework (Agent-MER), which reframes the OV-MER task as a problem to be solved by an agent that mimics the human cognitive process through knowledge-guided deliberation. We first construct a hierarchical Emotion Tree to serve as the agent's knowledge base. Building on this, we design a Knowledge-Guided Hierarchical Deliberation reasoning process. This process systematically explores the entire emotional landscape through a three-level, coarse-to-fine iterative reasoning process, enabling the identification of a richer and deeper range of emotions. Finally, a Self-Consistent Voting mechanism is employed to aggregate the results from multiple reasoning runs, ensuring the robustness of the final output. Experiments conducted in the MER2025 Challenge demonstrate that our proposed method achieved a top-ranking score of 61.04\%, securing first place and significantly outperforming existing baselines. This work not only provides an effective solution for OV-MER but also opens up new avenues for developing more human-like affective intelligence systems."
10.1145/3746059.3747681,StorySage: Conversational Autobiography Writing Powered by a Multi-Agent Framework,"Every individual carries a unique and personal life story shaped by their memories and experiences. However, these memories are often scattered and difficult to organize into a coherent narrative—a challenge that defines the task of autobiography writing. Existing conversational writing assistants tend to rely on generic user interactions and pre-defined guidelines, making it difficult for these systems to capture personal memories and develop a complete biography over time. We introduce StorySage, a user-driven software system designed to meet the needs of a diverse group of users that supports a flexible conversation and a structured approach to autobiography writing. Powered by a multi-agent framework composed of an Interviewer, Session Scribe, Planner, Section Writer, and Session Coordinator, our system iteratively collects user memories, updates their autobiography, and plans for future conversations. In experimental simulations, StorySage demonstrates its ability to navigate multiple sessions and capture user memories across many conversations. User studies (N = 28) highlight how StorySage maintains improved conversational flow, narrative completeness, and higher user satisfaction when compared to a baseline. In summary, StorySage contributes both a novel architecture for autobiography writing and insights into how multi-agent systems can enhance human-AI creative partnerships."
10.1145/3746059.3747722,Creating General User Models from Computer Use,"Human-computer interaction has long imagined technology that understands us—from our preferences and habits, to the timing and purpose of our everyday actions. Yet current user models remain fragmented, narrowly tailored to specific applications, and incapable of the flexible, cross-context reasoning required to fulfill these visions. This paper presents an architecture for a general user model (GUM) that learns about you by observing any interaction you have with your computer. The GUM takes as input any unstructured observation of a user (e.g., device screenshots) and constructs confidence-weighted natural language propositions that capture that user’s behavior, knowledge, beliefs, and preferences. GUMs can infer that a user is preparing for a wedding they’re attending from a message thread with a friend. Or recognize that a user is struggling with a collaborator’s feedback on a draft paper by observing multiple stalled edits and a switch to reading related work. GUMs introduce an architecture that infers new propositions about a user from multimodal observations, retrieves related propositions for context, and continuously revises existing propositions. To illustrate the breadth of applications that GUMs enable, we demonstrate how they augment chat-based assistants with contextual understanding, manage OS notifications to surface important information only when needed, and enable interactive agents that adapt to user preferences across applications. We also instantiate a new class of proactive assistants (Gumbos) that discover and execute useful suggestions on a user’s behalf based on their GUM. In our evaluations, we find that GUMs make calibrated and accurate inferences about users, and that assistants built on GUMs proactively identify and perform actions of meaningful value that users wouldn’t think to request explicitly. Altogether, GUMs introduce new methods that leverage large multimodal models to understand unstructured user context, enabling both long-standing visions of HCI and entirely new interactive systems that anticipate user needs."
10.1145/3746059.3747789,Cooperative Design Optimization through Natural Language Interaction,"Designing successful interactions requires identifying optimal design parameters. To do so, designers often conduct iterative user testing and exploratory trial-and-error. This involves balancing multiple objectives in a high-dimensional space, making the process time-consuming and cognitively demanding. System-led optimization methods, such as those based on Bayesian optimization, can determine for designers which parameters to test next. However, they offer limited opportunities for designers to intervene in the optimization process, negatively impacting the designer’s experience. We propose a design optimization framework that enables natural language interactions between designers and the optimization system, facilitating cooperative design optimization. This is achieved by integrating system-led optimization methods with Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing designers to intervene in the optimization process and better understand the system’s reasoning. Experimental results show that our method provides higher user agency than a system-led method and shows promising optimization performance compared to manual design. It also matches the performance of an existing cooperative method with lower cognitive load."
10.1145/3746252.3760995,STARec: An Efficient Agent Framework for Recommender Systems via Autonomous Deliberate Reasoning,"While modern recommender systems are instrumental in navigating information abundance, they remain fundamentally limited by static user modeling and reactive decision-making paradigms. Current large language model (LLM)-based agents inherit these shortcomings through their overreliance on heuristic pattern matching, yielding recommendations prone to shallow correlation bias, limited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse-data scenarios. We introduce STARec, a slow-thinking augmented agent framework that endows recommender systems with autonomous deliberative reasoning capabilities. Each user is modeled as an agent with parallel cognitions: fast response for immediate interactions and slow reasoning that performs chain-of-thought rationales. To cultivate intrinsic slow thinking, we develop anchored reinforcement training-a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge distillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward shaping. This hybrid approach scaffolds agents in acquiring foundational capabilities (preference summarization, rationale generation) while enabling dynamic policy adaptation through simulated feedback loops. Experiments on MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks demonstrate that STARec achieves substantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines, despite using only 0.4\% of the full training data."
10.1145/3746252.3761057,On Verifiable Legal Reasoning: A Multi-Agent Framework with Formalized Knowledge Representations,"Legal reasoning requires both precise interpretation of statutory language and consistent application of complex rules, presenting significant challenges for AI systems. This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework that decomposes legal reasoning into distinct knowledge acquisition and application stages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and formalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes. The second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps: analyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing symbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating final answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the ontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with symbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points, significantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches. Evaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial improvements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\% accuracy compared to 18.8\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between reasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated legal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while enhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a foundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and effective AI systems for legal domain."
10.1145/3746252.3761059,DIVAgent: A Diversified Search Agent that Mimics the Human Search Process,"Search result diversification plays a crucial role in addressing query ambiguity and multi-faceted information needs by reducing redundancy across documents. While previous supervised approaches can achieve superior performance, they require costly, large-scale annotated data. In contrast, unsupervised methods are more flexible and training-free but rely on manually designed ranking functions, often leading to suboptimal performance. Inspired by how humans explore diverse information during real-world searching, we propose a diversified search agent DIVAgent to combine the advantages of supervised and unsupervised methods. DIVAgent introduces LLMs as the ''brain'' to reason over complex and diverse search results and delineate human cognitive processes into a workflow tailored for search result diversification. Our search agent first identifies potential user intents and then analyzes the alignment of each document to the intents via an intent-aware module. To guide the generation of diversified document rankings, we design an intent-guided ranker that explicitly links documents to their dominant intents while performing greedy document selection. Experimental results demonstrate that DIVAgent significantly outperforms existing unsupervised baselines and achieves competitive performance with supervised models, highlighting the promise of LLMs for diversified ranking in realistic search scenarios."
10.1145/3746252.3761363,Parse-LLM: A Prior-Free LLM Parser for Unknown System Logs,"Log parsing extracts structured information from unstructured logs and serves as a fundamental pre-processing step for various log-based analytics and monitoring tasks. Recent advances have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle log format complexities and enhance parsing performance. However, these methods heavily rely on labeled data, which is often scarce in rapidly evolving industrial systems, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Moreover, the sheer volume of logs results in slow parsing and high computational costs, further hindering the deployment of LLM-based log parsing systems. To address these issues, we propose Parse-LLM, an unsupervised end-to-end log parsing framework based on LLMs Specifically, we first developed a Log Decomposer Agent that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and callable tools, enabling the LLM to autonomously separate log headers from content. Next, we introduce the Hybrid Log Partition module, which segments logs by balancing commonalities and differences. Finally, we developed a novel Variation-aware Log Parsing module that allows the LLM to harness additional supervisory signals through comparative analysis of similar logs. Comprehensive experiments conducted on large-scale public datasets show that Parse-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art log parsers in an unsupervised setting, offering an effective and scalable solution for the practical application of unsupervised log parsing."
10.1145/3746276.3760471,ZJUT-MM@MUCG Challenge: Agent Network for Multimodal Video Understanding,"This technical report presents an Agent Network architecture for complex multimodal video understanding, developed for the MUCG Video Comprehension scope. The framework is built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling standardized, provider-agnostic integration of heterogeneous tools. It adopts a three-layer hierarchy: an Orchestrator Agent for task classification and schema injection, a Thinking Agent for reasoning and planning, and multiple Expert Agents for specialized capabilities such as captioning, detection, tracking, zoom-in analysis, optical flow, and depth estimation. Guided by the ReAct cognitive paradigm, the Thinking Agent performs iterative ''Thinking–Acting–Observing'' cycles to decompose tasks, invoke tools, and refine results. An adaptive refinement mechanism further enhances performance through progressive frame sampling and LLM-based self-evaluation, balancing computational efficiency with reasoning quality. This modular and scalable design enables robust handling of diverse long-video tasks and produces benchmark-ready, structured outputs for evaluation. The code is released at https://github.com/wangzheng17/ZJUT-MM-MUCG25."
10.1145/3746277.3760412,Multimodal Trait and Emotion Recognition via Agentic AI: An End-to-End Pipeline,"This paper describes an end-to-end, modular, agentic system for inferring personality traits and emotional states based on multimodal interview-style data, when behavioral metadata (response time, body language, speech features, etc.) are made available. The system architecture consisted of a Perception Agent for classifying the emotions, an Inference Agent for estimating Big Five personality traits, and a Dialogue Agent for producing psychologically informed responses. A retrieval-augmented memory module connected the three agents to maintain context and continuity in the dialogue. The agents used two different language model backbones, LLaMA 3.2 1B and Falcon-RW-1B, learning and reasoning within the same processing pipeline while evaluating their performance on a benchmark of 19 annotated queries across a range of emotional states, conversation scenarios, and context. The evaluation assessed processing latency, lexical diversity, and consistency of trait estimation. The key finding for this study was that integrating metadata and modular reasoning leads to more contextually relevant and empathic responses than just prompting the agent. LLaMA produced longer, richer, and more diverse output while Falcon scores a much lower latency with shorter, predictable, and consistent responses. Overall, this study demonstrates that the combination of multimodal affective signals and agentic reasoning can lead to better human–AI interaction. While the work presented here is a proof-of-concept that is constrained by a benchmark experiment, it lays the grounds for scaling response models beyond the types of responses evaluated in this study, introduces more evaluation metrics, and enables more robust personalization features in future dialogue systems."
10.1145/3748304,Large Language Models for Information Retrieval: A Survey,"As a primary means of information acquisition, information retrieval (IR) systems, such as search engines, have integrated themselves into our daily lives. These systems also serve as components of dialogue, question-answering, and recommender systems. The trajectory of IR has evolved dynamically from its origins in term-based methods to its integration with advanced neural models. While the neural models excel at capturing complex contextual signals and semantic nuances, they still face challenges such as data scarcity, interpretability, and the generation of contextually plausible yet potentially inaccurate responses. This evolution requires a combination of traditional methods (such as term-based sparse retrieval methods with rapid response) and modern neural architectures (such as language models with powerful language understanding capacity). Meanwhile, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing due to their remarkable language understanding, generation, and reasoning abilities. Consequently, recent research has sought to leverage LLMs to improve IR systems. Given the rapid evolution of this research trajectory, it is necessary to consolidate existing methodologies and provide nuanced insights through a comprehensive overview. In this survey, we delve into the confluence of LLMs and IR systems, including crucial aspects such as query rewriters, retrievers, rerankers, readers, and search agents."
10.1145/3749893.3749973,Empathic Growth: Designing Human-Plant Interaction through Artistic Exploration,"This paper presents Empathic Growth, an inter-species interactive art installation that explores plant perception from a more-than-human perspective. Grounded in Jakob von Uexk\""{u}ll’s concept of Umwelt, the installation recognizes plants as active participants with their own perceptual worlds. By visualizing the biosignals of both humans and plants in a shared environment, Empathic Growth creates a visualized space of shared perception, encouraging participants to reflect on plant agency and fostering empathy between species. The installation exhibition revealed that participants developed a greater awareness of plant perception and a deeper empathy for plant life, encouraging a rethinking of human-plant relationships. Through three iterative exhibitions, Empathic Growth evolved from an initial experiment exploring emotional symbiosis between humans and plants into a real-time interactive hybrid perception interface, ultimately into digital hybrid forms as an agent-based artificial life with collective behaviors. This process realized an exploration of the interaction of human-plant empathy and the digital artificial life of growth."
10.1145/3757110.3757143,Application of Self-Play Deep Reinforcement Learning in Task Planning for UAV Swarms under Capacity Constraints,"This paper develops an Adaptive Staircase-based Policy Space Response Oracle (ASP) architecture that uses a self-play deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to solve the problem of planning tasks for UAV swarms in urban logistics and post-disaster rescue situations when there isn't enough time and resources. We show that UAV swarm path planning may be optimized across different scales by combining a two-player meta-game structure with adversarial instance creation and developing a staircase curriculum learning mechanism. The framework lets you learn from small amounts of pre-training (10 to 100 inspection points) and apply that knowledge to larger applications (200 to 1000 inspection points). The results of the experiments indicate that the ASP-based method works better than traditional Policy Optimization for Multi-Agent (POMO) algorithms. It cuts the average solution time by 41\% and the total flight distance by 55.6\% in tasks with a thousand nodes. This paper offers a systematic engineering approach for dynamic task planning in UAV swarms, overcoming the problem of balancing exploration and exploitation in complicated state spaces and proving that it can be used in a variety of situations."
10.1145/3757232.3757240,Deep Rooted Connections: Cultivating Human-Plant-Computer Interaction Across Cultures and Technologies,"Human-Plant-Computer Interaction (HPCI) is an emerging interdisciplinary field that explores the integration of humans, plants, and computational technologies to create innovative, sustainable, and meaningful interactions. This paper presents a thematic-historical review of HPCI, tracing its roots across diverse domains such as bioelectrical engineering, agriculture, art, architecture, and robotics. It also highlights its evolution into modern applications like virtual environments, tangible interfaces, and extended reality. The review reveals HPCI’s broad scope, cultural and technological foundations, and capacity to address global challenges, particularly sustainability. While North America, Europe, and Asia – especially Japan – dominate the research landscape, contributions from Africa and South America remain limited. This gap underscores the need for a more inclusive approach incorporating diverse cultural and ecological knowledge. This paper identifies key milestones, trends, and interdisciplinary overlaps by examining the field’s progression, offering insights into HPCI’s potential to enrich human-nature relationships. The paper advocates for a broader definition of HPCI that accommodates regional perspectives and promotes collaboration across disciplines. Future directions include visualizing HPCI’s geographical and temporal evolution, exploring researchers’ motivations, and fostering contributions from underrepresented regions. These efforts can help ensure that HPCI addresses pressing global sustainability issues and represents the diverse voices and contexts essential for its growth. This review aims to inspire a more inclusive, globally relevant HPCI research community and advance sustainable innovation at the intersection of technology, ecology, and culture."
10.1145/3757566,"Co-Writing with AI, on Human Terms: Aligning Research with User Demands Across the Writing Process","As generative AI tools like ChatGPT become integral to everyday writing, critical questions arise about how to preserve writers' sense of agency and ownership when using these tools. Yet, a systematic understanding of how AI assistance affects different aspects of the writing process-and how this shapes writers' agency-remains underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review of 109 HCI papers using the PRISMA approach. From this literature, we identify four overarching design strategies for AI writing support-structured guidance, guided exploration, active co-writing, and critical feedback-mapped across the four key cognitive processes in writing: planning, translating, reviewing, and monitoring. We complement this analysis with interviews of 15 writers across diverse domains. Our findings reveal that writers' desired levels of AI intervention vary across the writing process: content-focused writers (e.g., academics) prioritize ownership during planning, while form-focused writers (e.g., creatives) value control over translating and reviewing. Writers' preferences are also shaped by contextual goals, values, and notions of originality and authorship. By examining when ownership matters, what writers want to own, and how AI interactions shape agency, we surface both alignment and gaps between research and user needs. Our findings offer actionable design guidance for developing human-centered writing tools for co-writing with AI, on human terms."
10.1145/3757887.3763009,Epistemic vs. Counterfactual Fairness in Allocation of Resources,"Resource allocation is fundamental to a variety of societal decision-making settings, ranging from the distribution of charitable donations to assigning limited public housing among interested families. A central challenge in this context is ensuring fair outcomes, which often requires balancing conflicting preferences of various stakeholders. While extensive research has been conducted on theoretical and algorithmic solutions within the fair division framework, much of this work neglects the subjective perception of fairness by individuals. This study focuses on the fairness notion of envy-freeness (EF), which ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent according to their own preferences. While the existence of exact EF allocations may not always be feasible, various approximate relaxations, such as counterfactual and epistemic EF, have been proposed. Through a series of experiments with human participants, we compare perceptions of fairness between three widely studied counterfactual and epistemic relaxations of EF. Our findings indicate that allocations based on epistemic EF are perceived as fairer than those based on counterfactual relaxations. Additionally, we examine a variety of factors, including scale, balance of outcomes, and cognitive effort involved in evaluating fairness and their role in the complexity of reasoning across treatments."
10.1145/3759355.3759371,Simulating Attachment Behavior in Mobile Robots Through Toy Following Tasks,"This paper presents a behaviorally inspired toy-following mobile robot system designed to simulate attachment-driven behavior, taking conceptual motivation from the Strange Situation Test (SST) used in canine psychology. The system integrates a top-down vision approach using a Basler a2A1920-160ucBAS camera, where a YOLOv11 object detection model—trained on a custom dataset with two classes (robot and toy)—is used to localize both entities in real time. A homography-based camera calibration process maps fisheye image coordinates to world positions, which are processed in a ROS-based architecture. Path planning is performed using the Improved RRT* with Reduced Random Map Size (IRRT*-RRMS) algorithm, while motion control combines Vector Field Histogram (VFH) for obstacle avoidance with a Pure Pursuit controller for trajectory tracking. The system was implemented on a TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi and evaluated in a 4.32 \texttimes{} 2.88-meter indoor environment with manually moved toy targets. Experimental results demonstrate high tracking accuracy and a strong success rate, confirming the system’s effectiveness in simulating real-time pursuit behavior under the attachment model. The proposed approach provides a foundation for future research in emotionally responsive robotics and animal-inspired human–robot interaction."
10.1145/3759928.3759967,BiLSTM-Based Climate and Agricultural Supply Chain Resilience Modeling Using Time Series Forecasting in Ghana,"This study proposes a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network to formulate a deep learning framework that predicts climate variables and measures the resilience of Ghana’s agricultural supply chain. The model uses past data from the Ghana Meteorological Agency to forecast future temperatures, rainfall, and a composite resilience index made up of crop yield, transport delay, labor availability, market price volatility, and storage capacity. The model architecture includes regularization methods like Batch Normalization, Gaussian Noise, and Layer Normalization. It then uses multi-output dense layers for tasks that need to make predictions at the same time. The model performed well in predicting the resilience index, with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.0819, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0687, and a R2 score of 0.0697. The proposed BiLSTM model outperformed the persistent baseline naive model. Predictions of raw climate variables weren’t very accurate because they are naturally unstable. However, the resilience index, which is a smoothed composite metric, was predicted with more consistency. These results show that BiLSTM-based models could help with climate-resilient agricultural planning and decision-making in places like Northern Ghana, where there isn’t a lot of data and the climate is unreliable."
10.1145/3760269.3760299,Outdoor Multi-UAV Collaborative Task Planning System Based on Multi-Agent and Improved PPO Algorithm,"Aiming at the problem of task collaboration and path planning for multi-agent drones in unknown environments, this paper proposes a multi-agent collaborative planning architecture that integrates a large language model (LLM) and a multimodal (MM) perception network, which is used for executing the multi-agent tasks in outdoor environments. This paper innovatively proposes an improved Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for path planning. Through a structured reward function and a joint strategy sharing mechanism, the path planning among multiple drones were efficiently achieved. The system in this paper innovatively proposes a loop intelligent control process called UTTUT (User Instruction, Task Graph Generation, Task Allocation, UAV Feedback, and Task Graph Updating), as well as a  ({P}^3)  (Perception, Planning, Prompt) factor graph model. Theoretically analyzes the interpretability of large model collaborative task planning. The Doubao large language model is introduced as the central control unit, and the Grounding DINO perception model is deployed at the drone end. By combining RGBD, semantic information, and asynchronous scheduling task factors, the perception and positioning of targets in complex scenes are realized. In addition, this paper compares the performances of different large model collaborative frameworks and gets the optimal large model control scheme results. Simulations are carried out on different platforms to verify the superiority of the framework proposed in this paper."
10.1145/3760269.3760353,ABCM: Agent-Based Complexity Management Method for Intelligent Manufacturing,"Modern intelligent manufacturing systems are inherently complex, driven by product variety, dynamic scheduling, and intricate interactions among humans, machines, and materials. This complexity presents significant challenges for production planning, control, and decision-making. To address these issues, we propose ABCM (Agent-Based Complexity Management), a novel method that integrates system dynamics simulation with a large language model (LLM)-based agent framework. ABCM utilizes PySD to simulate manufacturing processes and extract structured model outputs, which are analyzed through a suite of modular tools registered within a LangChain agent. These tools enable the computation of descriptive statistics, dynamic performance indicators, and complexity metrics—including entropy, rise time, overshoot, and integral errors—thus allowing for automated, data-driven complexity assessment. The agent autonomously interprets simulation results, identifies performance bottlenecks, and offers optimization recommendations. A case study demonstrates the practical application of ABCM in managing production variability and enhancing system responsiveness. The modular and extensible architecture supports scalable deployment in diverse intelligent manufacturing scenarios, contributing to improved adaptability, efficiency, and complexity control."
10.1145/3760622.3760647,Machine Learning-based Feature Evaluation of the Factors Affecting the Effective Infrastructure Project Implementation,"Numerous factors affect how well infrastructure projects are implemented in different agencies and organizations, therefore identifying the important factors requires a data-driven approach. This study uses neural network simulations to examine the relative impact of various components using a feature evaluation based on machine learning. Neural network simulations yielded high predictive accuracy, with correlation coefficients (R) ranging from 0.97294 to 0.99084 and mean squared errors (MSE) between 0.014255 and 0.024731, validating the robustness of the model. Results indicate that the absence of a Project Procurement Management Plan (PPMP) and Annual Procurement Plan preparation is the most critical parameter in implementation requirements. In fund management, interagency funds not taken up in trust accounts emerged as the most influential factor, highlighting potential financial inefficiencies. Architectural \&amp; Engineering (A&amp;E) and Administration \&amp; Supervision (A&amp;S) expense allocations were found to be the primary determinants in the budget allocation category. For procurement of equipment, supplies, materials, and services, the absence of lease-to-own agreements significantly impacts cost-effective resource acquisition. Additionally, deviations from audit guidelines in rental fee disbursements pose financial accountability risks in the authority to charge fees for equipment rental. These results highlight the necessity of better financial supervision, procurement planning, and regulatory compliance to increase the efficiency and transparency of infrastructure projects, offering policymakers and agency administrators practical insights."
10.1145/3760658.3760664,Gap-Guided Evolutionary Deep Reinforcement Learning for Hierarchical Navigation in Structured Dynamic Environments,"Multi-agent collision avoidance—where an ego-robot must navigate from a start pose to a goal pose while avoiding both static obstacles and dynamic agents—is a longstanding challenge in motion planning. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored for this task, but most RL-based solutions address simplified scenarios, often omitting complex static obstacles and focusing primarily on dynamic agent avoidance. Consequently, these approaches are unsuitable for structured environments such as mazes or indoor layouts with significant static geometry. To address this limitation, we integrate a multi-agent collision avoidance policy—specifically the GPU-accelerated Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic for Collision Avoidance (Evolution GA3C-CADRL) [4]—within a hierarchical navigation framework. Our method incorporates a local waypoint planner that leverages global navigation plans and real-time sensor data to generate short-term waypoints, ensuring clear paths devoid of static obstacles between the agent and the next target. This architecture effectively mitigates the original model’s inability to handle static constraints. The full system integrates global planning, perception-informed gap-based waypoint generation, and deep RL for local control. We empirically evaluate our hierarchical planner across five structured environments and demonstrate that the integrated waypoint + RL approach consistently reduces collision rates and improves goal-reaching success compared to the standalone RL model. Results show substantial improvements in both navigation robustness and success rate under realistic, complex scenarios."
10.1145/3762657,Grasp-HGN: Grasping the Unexpected,"For transradial amputees, robotic prosthetic hands promise to regain the capability to perform daily living activities. To advance next-generation prosthetic hand control design, it is crucial to address current shortcomings in robustness to out of lab artifacts, and generalizability to new environments. Due to the fixed number of object to interact with in existing datasets, contrasted with the virtually infinite variety of objects encountered in the real world, current grasp models perform poorly on unseen objects, negatively affecting users’ independence and quality of life.To address this: (i) we define semantic projection, the ability of a model to generalize to unseen object types and show that conventional models like YOLO, despite 80\% training accuracy, drop to 15\% on unseen objects. (ii) We propose Grasp-LLaVA, a Grasp Vision Language Model enabling human-like reasoning to infer the suitable grasp type estimate based on the object’s physical characteristics resulting in a significant 50.2\% accuracy over unseen object types compared to 36.7\% accuracy of an SOTA grasp estimation model.Lastly, to bridge the performance-latency gap, we propose Hybrid Grasp Network (HGN), an edge-cloud deployment infrastructure enabling fast grasp estimation on edge and accurate cloud inference as a fail-safe, effectively expanding the latency vs. accuracy Pareto. HGN with confidence calibration (DC) enables dynamic switching between edge and cloud models, improving semantic projection accuracy by 5.6\% (to 42.3\%) with 3.5\texttimes{} speedup over the unseen object types. Over a real-world sample mix, it reaches 86\% average accuracy (12.2\% gain over edge-only), and 2.2\texttimes{} faster inference than Grasp-LLaVA alone."
10.1145/3764587,Contract Embeddings for Layered Control Architectures,"The design of complex cyber-physical system architectures is often hierarchical. System specifications are mapped to an implementation layer via a stepwise refinement process involving multiple intermediate layers. These layers may capture different functionalities, and the orchestration of a variety of heterogeneous techniques suited to each layer may be required to achieve the overall design objectives. Due to their heterogeneity, ensuring traceability and verifiability of such architectures is a challenging problem. In this article, we present a correct-by-construction methodology for designing heterogeneous layered architectures. We capture the specifications at each layer with assume-guarantee contracts, a specification paradigm which can encompass a variety of modeling formalisms. We then use the notion of contract embeddings to define specification refinement, rigorously and traceably mapping specifications across layers modeled with heterogeneous formalisms. We instantiate our methodology on the design of layered control architectures (LCAs), resulting in a novel approach that can verifiably orchestrate domain-specific techniques to satisfy both global planning and local safety requirements. In the context of LCAs, we derive necessary conditions for correct specification refinement and results for compositional realization of control safety specifications. We illustrate our design methodology on a motivating example and a case study derived from robotic mission planning and control."
10.1145/3764921.3770147,Experiential geosimulation,"We introduce experiential geosimulation as a medium for co-exploring embodied behavioral geography, physical locomotion and sensorimotor control, and spatial vision and perception. Methodologically, this convergence is approached through interconnection of high-fidelity geographic automata systems, running in virtual geographic environments within virtual reality head-mounted displays, while spatial telematics and neural activity are collected through eye tracking on a single-board computer and encephalography (EEG) is processed from a scalp-mounted brain-computer interface. Data exchange between these diverse geographic information systems allows for the creation of synthetic simulation scenarios that can evoke realistic locomotion and task behavior from real, physically involved human users. Here, we show that the system also entices people's realistic neural activity, which can provide insight into users' experiences as navigation, agency, spatial vision, landmark salience, non-verbal communications, and cognitive where/what reasoning."
10.1145/3765286,TableTalk: Scaffolding Spreadsheet Development with a Language Agent,"Spreadsheet programming is challenging. Programmers use spreadsheet programming knowledge (e.g., formulas) and problem-solving skills to combine actions into complex tasks. Advancements in large language models have introduced language agents that observe, plan, and perform tasks, showing promise for spreadsheet creation. We present TableTalk, a spreadsheet programming agent embodying three design principles—scaffolding, flexibility, and incrementality—derived from studies with seven spreadsheet programmers and 85 Excel templates. TableTalk guides programmers through structured plans based on professional workflows, generating three potential next steps to adapt plans to programmer needs. It uses pre-defined tools to generate spreadsheet components and incrementally build spreadsheets. In a study with 20 programmers, TableTalk produced higher-quality spreadsheets 2.3 times more likely to be preferred than the baseline. It reduced cognitive load and thinking time by 12.6\%. From this, we derive design guidelines for agentic spreadsheet programming tools and discuss implications on spreadsheet programming, end-user programming, AI-assisted programming, and human-agent collaboration."
10.1145/3765618,ROS-BDI robots: an agent-based approach for programming the behaviour of autonomous robots,"The Robotic Operating System (ROS) provides resources that facilitate the development of robots. However, these resources do not provide robots with some features required in complex scenarios, such as goal-oriented behaviour, autonomy, deliberative capabilities, social abilities, and proactivity combined with reactivity. On the other hand, these features are inherent to Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents, whose behaviour results from reasoning over explicit representations of their beliefs (information about the environment), desires (goals to be achieved), and intentions (commitments to those goals). This work addresses the integration between ROS and BDI agents. This integration is addressed both at a conceptual level, where ROS and BDI concepts are aligned, and in a more practical level, where programming tools are presented to program the behaviour of ROS-based robots as BDI agents. The proposal is evaluated through application examples. The results of this work include an integration model and tools to develop these robots."
10.1145/3766882.3767169,AgentSight: System-Level Observability for AI Agents Using eBPF,"Modern software infrastructure increasingly relies on LLM agents for development and maintenance, such as Claude Code and Gemini-cli. However, these AI agents differ fundamentally from traditional deterministic software, posing a significant challenge to conventional monitoring and debugging. This creates a critical semantic gap: existing tools observe either an agent's high-level intent (via LLM prompts) or its low-level actions (e.g., system calls), but cannot correlate these two views. This blindness makes it difficult to distinguish between benign operations, malicious attacks, and costly failures. We introduce AgentSight, an AgentOps observability framework that bridges this semantic gap using a hybrid approach. Our approach, boundary tracing, monitors agents from outside their application code at stable system interfaces using eBPF. AgentSight intercepts TLS-encrypted LLM traffic to extract semantic intent, monitors kernel events to observe system-wide effects, and causally correlates these two streams across process boundaries using a real-time engine and secondary LLM analysis. This instrumentation-free technique is framework-agnostic, resilient to rapid API changes, and incurs less than 3\% performance overhead. Our evaluation shows AgentSight detects prompt injection attacks, identifies resource-wasting reasoning loops, and reveals hidden coordination bottlenecks in multi-agent systems. AgentSight is released as an open-source project at https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/agentsight."
10.1145/3766918.3766948,Toward Verifiable Misinformation Detection: A Multi-Tool LLM Agent Framework,"With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), the detection of misinformation has become increasingly important and complex. This research proposes an innovative verifiable misinformation detection LLM agent that goes beyond traditional true/false binary judgments. The agent actively verifies claims through dynamic interaction with diverse web sources, assesses information source credibility, synthesizes evidence, and provides a complete verifiable reasoning process. Our designed agent architecture includes three core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics, quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against rewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms baseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency, and resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking."
10.1145/3767624.3767637,Radish Harvester Path Planning Based on Improved U-Net Algorithm,"Accurate recognition of crop rows is important for agricultural robot path planning and navigation. The traditional U-Net model suffers from mask discontinuity and edge blurring when recognizing crop rows in complex field environments, which seriously affects the accuracy and stability of path planning. To solve this problem, an improved U-Net algorithm (HSA-Unet) based on the Hybrid Spatial Attention mechanism (HSA) is proposed for enhancing the coherence and structural robustness of the crop row mask in the radish harvester path planning task. Meanwhile, a radish row image dataset containing eight typical changing scenarios, such as different light conditions, weed interference, and row breakage, was constructed to comprehensively evaluate the model's adaptability in the complex field environment. In addition, the centerline of the crop rows for the model prediction mask was determined by the triangular scanning method, and an End-of-Row (EOR) detection method combining continuous frame detection and odometer constraints was designed to achieve reliable identification of the end of the radish rows and automatic triggering of row change signals. The results of systematic experiments conducted on the Gazebo simulation platform show that HSA-Unet achieves an average IoU of 35.65\% in the turnip row segmentation task, which is better than the 27.08\% of the traditional U-Net, and the stability of mask prediction is significantly enhanced. Meanwhile, the mobile platform achieves a path planning quality score of 0.86 under different initial yaw angles (±20°), demonstrating good heading adaptive capability and dynamic path adjustment. The proposed method provides effective and robust technical support for deploying agricultural robots in complex field environments. It has potential generalization value in other crop row recognition tasks."
10.1145/3768292.3770347,ProtoHedge: Interpretable Hedging with Market Prototypes,"Deep hedging has emerged as a powerful framework for financial risk management, capable of learning effective hedging strategies in the presence of market frictions. However, its reliance on black-box neural networks creates a critical barrier to adoption, limiting trust, auditability, and regulatory compliance. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a transparent alternative to the black-box Deep Hedging paradigm. Instead of relying on an opaque architecture, our model learns a finite set of representative market states, or “prototypes”. Hedging decisions are then made via a transparent, similarity-based mechanism: the agent’s action is a weighted average of learned actions associated with each prototype. We call our specific implementation of this framework ProtoHedge. The reasoning approach makes every decision traceable to understandable market scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments in both classical Black-Scholes and more realistic stochastic volatility environments. Our results demonstrate that this interpretability is achieved with minimal impact of less than 0.40\% on hedging performance, as our model’s hedging effectiveness is comparable to that of the original black-box deep hedging agent. This work shows that transparency and performance are not mutually exclusive, paving the way for more trustworthy automated risk management systems."
10.1145/3768292.3770383,AuditAgent: Expert-Guided Multi-Agent Reasoning for Cross-Document Fraudulent Evidence Discovery,"Financial fraud detection in real-world scenarios presents significant challenges due to the subtlety and dispersion of evidence across complex, multi-year financial disclosures. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent reasoning framework AuditAgent, enhanced with auditing domain expertise, for fine-grained evidence chain localization in financial fraud cases. Leveraging an expert-annotated dataset constructed from enforcement documents and financial reports released by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, our approach integrates subject-level risk priors, a hybrid retrieval strategy, and specialized agent modules to efficiently identify and aggregate cross-report evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms General-Purpose Agent paradigm in both recall and interpretability, establishing a new benchmark for automated, transparent financial forensics. Our results highlight the value of domain-specific reasoning and dataset construction for advancing robust financial fraud detection in practical, real-world regulatory applications."

10.1145/3768292.3771251,Structured Agentic Workflows for Financial Time-Series Modelling with LLMs and Reflective Feedback,"Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce TS-Agent, a modular agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection, code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and reducing error propagation. TS-Agent supports adaptive learning, robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that TS-Agent consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability."
10.1145/3768740.3768800,Master-Slave Robot Collaborative Control Strategy Research Based on Multi-Source Data Fusion and Dynamic Target Recognition,"Master-slave robotic collaborative systems face technical challenges in multi-source information processing and real-time target recognition in complex dynamic environments. To address the limitations of traditional single-sensor data and insufficient target recognition accuracy, a master-slave robot cooperative control strategy based on multi-source data fusion and dynamic target recognition is proposed. The strategy employs a data fusion algorithm combining Extended Kalman Filter and Particle Filter to effectively integrate information from LiDAR, RGB-D cameras, and IMU sensors. A dynamic target recognition model based on YOLOv5 is constructed, incorporating the DeepSORT tracking algorithm to achieve real-time target tracking and state prediction. A hierarchical cooperative control architecture based on Contract Net Protocol is designed, where the master robot undertakes global task planning and resource scheduling, while slave robots execute local path planning and precise operation control. Experimental results demonstrate that the control strategy achieves a target recognition accuracy of 94.2\%, improves collaborative operation efficiency by 32.4\%, and reduces system response time to 120ms, significantly outperforming other methods, providing an effective solution for multi-robot collaborative operations in intelligent manufacturing environments."
10.1145/3769111,Conformal Temporal Logic Planning using Large Language Models,"This paper addresses temporal logic task planning problems for mobile robots. We consider missions that require accomplishing multiple high-level sub-tasks, expressed in natural language (NL), in a temporal and logical order. To formally define the mission, we treat these sub-tasks as atomic predicates in a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula. We refer to this task specification framework as LTL-NL. Our goal is to design plans, defined as sequences of robot actions, accomplishing LTL-NL tasks. This action planning problem cannot be solved directly by existing LTL planners due to the NL nature of atomic predicates. Therefore, we propose HERACLEs, a hierarchical neuro-symbolic planner that relies on a novel integration of (i) existing symbolic planners generating high-level task plans determining the order at which the NL sub-tasks should be accomplished; (ii) pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to design sequences of robot actions for each sub-task in these task plans; and (iii) conformal prediction acting as a formal interface between (i) and (ii) and managing uncertainties due to LLM imperfections. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that HERACLEs can achieve user-defined mission success rates. We demonstrate the efficiency of HERACLEs through comparative numerical experiments against recent LLM-based planners as well as hardware experiments on mobile manipulation tasks. Finally, we present examples demonstrating that our approach enhances user-friendliness compared to conventional symbolic approaches."
10.1145/3770857,A BDI Task-oriented Agent in Belief Space,"Building conversational agents to help humans in domain-specific tasks is challenging since the agent needs to understand the natural language and act over it while accessing domain expert knowledge. Modern natural language processing techniques led to an expansion of conversational agents, with recent pretrained language models achieving increasingly accurate language recognition results using ever-larger open datasets. However, the black-box nature of such pretrained language models obscures the agent's reasoning and its motivations when responding, leading to unexplained dialogues. In this work, we develop a belief-desire-intention (BDI) agent as a task-oriented dialogue system to introduce mental attitudes similar to humans describing their behavior during a dialogue. We compare the BDI model with pipeline task-oriented dialogue system architecture by leveraging existing components from dialogue systems and developing the agent's intention selection as a dialogue policy. We show that combining traditional agent modelling approaches, such as BDI, with more recent learning techniques can result in efficient and scrutable dialogue systems."
10.1145/3771555,VUI Testing of VPA Apps via Behavior Model-Enhanced LLM Agents,"With the increasing adoption of smart speakers, Virtual Personal Assistant (VPA) applications have become integral to daily life, enabling users to access news, entertainment, and smart device control through Voice User Interfaces (VUI). However, many VPA apps suffer from quality issues, such as unexpected terminations and failures to process common user commands, highlighting the urgent need for systematic and efficient VUI testing. Existing chatbot-style and model-based testing approaches lack global and semantic awareness, resulting in ineffective test case generation and inefficient state exploration.To address these challenges, we introduce Elevate, a model-enhanced, LLM-driven VPA testing framework that employs a multi-agent architecture to enhance VUI behavior testing. Elevate comprises three specialized LLM agents—Observer, Generator, and Planner—that collaboratively perform state extraction, test case generation, and guided state exploration. Additionally, a deterministic finite automaton (DFA)-based behavior model is designed to abstract app behavior and provide structured guidance to LLM agents, enhancing testing performance. Elevate also incorporates a feedback mechanism that refines testing strategies based on observed behaviors, ensuring continuous improvement.Implemented using GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek-R1, Elevate has been evaluated on problem detection, sentence/semantic coverage, and large-scale testing. Experimental results show that Elevate outperforms state-of-the-art methods (Vitas and LLM-based chatbots), detecting at least 18 and 37 more problems, respectively, and achieving over 10\% and 30\% higher state coverage. In a large-scale evaluation on 4,000 Alexa skills, Elevate further demonstrated 15\% higher coverage than Vitas, confirming its effectiveness, scalability, and potential for widespread application in VUI testing."
10.1145/3772077,LUMEN: Enhancing IoT System Observability with Multi-Agent Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs,"The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) systems has transformed industries through real-time monitoring and automation, generating vast and heterogeneous data streams. As IoT networks expand, the increasing volume and diversity of data, spanning real-time telemetry, device logs, and historical records, complicate the management of IoT systems, including system monitoring, analysis, and reasoning. To address this challenge, we introduce LUMEN (Large Language Models as Unified Multi-Agent Systems for IoT ENhancement), a novel approach combining multi-agent Large Language Models (LLMs), knowledge graphs, and heterogeneous databases to enable cognitive digital twins for IoT observability. LUMEN models IoT systems as knowledge graphs, capturing device relationships and metadata while monitoring data is stored in time-series or object databases. Specialized LLM-based agents collaborate dynamically to analyze IoT systems and explain the findings in natural language, generating and executing analysis code when necessary. Integrated with off-the-shelf network monitoring tools, LUMEN facilitates semantic reasoning and human-in-the-loop collaboration, delivering adaptive insights across diverse data contexts. Two industrial case studies demonstrate the ability of LUMEN to automate analysis workflows, enhance system adaptability, and provide interpretable analytics. This work advances IoT observability by integrating LLMs, semantic intelligence, and explainable analytics into a scalable and adaptive solution using a multi-agent architecture for complex IoT systems."
10.1145/3774946,MemIndex: Agentic Event-based Distributed Memory Management for Multi-agent Systems,"Interactive applications are latency-sensitive systems that enable dynamic responses to user inputs in domains such as robotics, industrial automation, and autonomous control. These applications require efficient application protocols for communication, with the pub/sub model being one of the most promising approaches. However, existing pub/sub systems are architecturally constrained, particularly by limited memory capacity and inefficiencies in dynamic environments. Addressing these challenges requires effective distributed memory management, yet this aspect has received limited attention in existing research. This paper addresses the gap by proposing MemIndex, an adaptive and autonomous distributed memory-management framework with an intent-indexed bipartite graph architecture. It is designed for an LM-based multi-agent pub/sub systems, enabling agents to autonomously negotiate memory operations in real time through dynamic index spaces for efficient reasoning. We evaluate our proposed MemIndex using diverse models against two baselines. Experimental results show MemIndex outperforms both baselines across storage, retrieval, update, and deletion operations, achieving average reductions of about 34\% and 56\% in elapsed time, 57\% and 75\% in CPU utilization, 23\% and 76\% in memory usage. Scalability tests further demonstrate that MemIndex maintains low end-to-end delay as submissions and agents grow, confirming that its negotiation-driven offloading enables efficient distributed memory management in interactive applications."
10.1177/0278364920963783,Hybrid conditional planning for robotic applications,"Robots who have partial observability of and incomplete knowledge about their environments may have to consider contingencies while planning, and thus necessitate cognitive abilities beyond classical planning. Moreover, during planning, they need to consider continuous feasibility checks for executability of the plans in the real world. Conditional planning is concerned with reaching goals from an initial state, in the presence of incomplete knowledge and partial observability, by considering all contingencies and by utilizing sensing actions to gather relevant knowledge when needed. A conditional plan is essentially a tree of actions where each branch of the tree represents a possible execution of actuation actions and sensing actions to reach a goal state. Hybrid conditional planning extends conditional planning by integrating feasibility checks into executability conditions of actions. We introduce a parallel offline algorithm, called HCPlan, for computing hybrid conditional plans. HCPlan relies on modeling deterministic effects of actuation actions and non-deterministic effects of sensing actions in the causality-based action language (Formula presented.). Branches of a hybrid conditional plan are computed in parallel using a SAT solver, where continuous feasibility checks are performed as needed. We develop a comprehensive benchmark suite and introduce new evaluation metrics for hybrid conditional planning. We evaluate HCPlan with extensive experiments in terms of computational efficiency and plan quality. We perform experiments to compare HCPlan with other related conditional planners and approaches to deal with contingencies due to incomplete knowledge. We further demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of HCPlan in service robotics applications, through dynamic simulations and physical implementations. © The Author(s) 2020."
10.1177/02783649251353181,Imperative learning: A self-supervised neuro-symbolic learning framework for robot autonomy,"Data-driven methods such as reinforcement and imitation learning have achieved remarkable success in robot autonomy. However, their data-centric nature still hinders them from generalizing well to ever-changing environments. Moreover, labeling data for robotic tasks is often impractical and expensive. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new self-supervised neuro-symbolic (NeSy) computational framework, imperative learning (IL), for robot autonomy, leveraging the generalization abilities of symbolic reasoning. The framework of IL consists of three primary components: a neural module, a reasoning engine, and a memory system. We formulate IL as a special bilevel optimization (BLO), which enables reciprocal learning over the three modules. This overcomes the label-intensive obstacles associated with data-driven approaches and takes advantage of symbolic reasoning concerning logical reasoning, physical principles, geometric analysis, etc. We discuss several optimization techniques for IL and verify their effectiveness in five distinct robot autonomy tasks including path planning, rule induction, optimal control, visual odometry, and multi-robot routing. Through various experiments, we show that IL can significantly enhance robot autonomy capabilities and we anticipate that it will catalyze further research across diverse domains. © The Author(s) 2025"
10.13031/aim.202100654,UAV remote sensing-based phenotyping to evaluate drought stress in turfgrass,"Breeding turfgrasses using classical plant breeding methods is a long-term process which requires a breeder to sort through large segregating populations by phenotypically evaluating the plants across multiple environments and over several years. The quality and frequency of phenotypic data collection at a field-scale is currently the bottleneck limiting the efficiency and accuracy of classical phenotype-based breeding. The use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing has proven to be viable method to collect geospatial data rapidly and at fine spatial and high temporal scales in major agricultural crops. In this study, UAV remote sensing and machine learning algorithms were utlilzed to evaluate drought stress on zoysiagrass (Zoysia spp.) breeding nursery planted in 2017. Selections of the top 2% best-performing hybrids under drought stress were made using visual parameters (turfgrass quality under normal and drydown conditions) as well as UAV-derived NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index). The results suggest an agreement between the conventional selection methods and proposed UAV phenotyping approaches. © ASABE 2021 Annual International Meeting"
10.1364/JOCN.533789,Near-real-time 6G service operation enabled by distributed intelligence and in-band telemetry,"The combination of highly dynamic network services requiring stringent quality of service (QoS), especially in terms of end-to-end (e2e) delay, together with capital and operational cost reduction cannot be faced using centralized software-defined networking (SDN) solutions only. In particular, such expected dynamicity requires autonomous near-real-time operation fed with pervasive telemetry to make per-service decisions that ensure the committed QoS, while reducing overprovisioning as much as possible. In this paper, we propose a distributed control architecture based on multi-agent systems (MASs) to assist the SDN controller in the control of network services near-real-time. Per-traffic flow telemetry data are collected from the packet nodes, distributed through the agents in the control plane, and analyzed to assure performance and to anticipate any degradation. Measurements feed flow agents, which are based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models, to make routing decisions aiming at ensuring flow performance. In the case when QoS degradation is detected, we propose algorithms to analyze its cause, which can be a result of some bottleneck in the network. We show how the latter is detected and additional capacity is requested of the SDN controller, which in turn creates an optical bypass to provide additional capacity. The proposed solution is demonstrated experimentally on a federated testbed connecting UPC and CNIT premises. Focused first on the control plane, the feasibility of the proposed architecture and workflows is experimentally assessed. After that, the performance of the near-real-time operation is evaluated at the data plane to verify that the maximum e2e delay is not exceeded for multiple flows, showing the effectiveness of predictive QoS evaluation together with infrastructure and service reconfiguration."
10.14778/3750601.3750611,"SagaLLM: Context Management, Validation, and Transaction Guarantees for Multi-Agent LLM Planning","This paper introduces SagaLLM, a structured multi-agent architecture designed to address four foundational limitations of current LLM-based planning systems: unreliable self-validation, context loss, lack of transactional safeguards, and insufficient inter-agent coordination. While recent frameworks leverage LLMs for task decomposition and multi-agent communication, they often fail to ensure consistency, rollback, or constraint satisfaction across distributed workflows. SagaLLM bridges this gap by integrating the Saga transactional pattern with persistent memory, automated compensation, and independent validation agents. It leverages LLMs' generative reasoning to automate key tasks traditionally requiring hand-coded coordination logic, including state tracking, dependency analysis, log schema generation, and recovery orchestration. Although SagaLLM relaxes strict ACID guarantees, it ensures workflow-wide consistency and recovery through modular checkpointing and compensable execution. Empirical evaluations across planning domains demonstrate that standalone LLMs frequently violate interdependent constraints or fail to recover from disruptions. In contrast, SagaLLM achieves significant improvements in consistency, validation accuracy, and adaptive coordination under uncertainty—establishing a robust foundation for real-world, scalable LLM-based multi-agent systems."
10.1527/tjsai.37-6_C-M11,Non-Axiomatic Term Logic: A Theory of Cognitive Symbolic Reasoning,"This paper presents Non-Axiomatic Term Logic (NATL) as a theoretical computational framework of human-like symbolic reasoning in artificial intelligence. NATL unites a discrete syntactic system inspired from Aristotle’s term logic and a continuous semantic system based on the modern idea of distributed representations, or embeddings. This paper positions the proposed approach in the phylogeny and the literature of logic, and explains the framework. As it is yet no more than a theory and it requires much further elaboration to implement it, no quantitative evaluation is presented. Instead, qualitative analyses of arguments using NATL, some applications to possible cognitive science/robotics-related research, and remaining issues towards a machinery implementation are discussed. © 2022, Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence.

10.1609/aaai.v35i13.17421,Planning with Learned Object Importance in Large Problem Instances using Graph Neural Networks,"Real-world planning problems often involve hundreds or even thousands of objects, straining the limits of modern planners. In this work, we address this challenge by learning to predict a small set of objects that, taken together, would be sufficient for finding a plan. We propose a graph neural network architecture for predicting object importance in a single inference pass, thus incurring little overhead while greatly reducing the number of objects that must be considered by the planner. Our approach treats the planner and transition model as black boxes, and can be used with any off-the-shelf planner. Empirically, across classical planning, probabilistic planning, and robotic task and motion planning, we find that our method results in planning that is significantly faster than several baselines, including other partial grounding strategies and lifted planners. We conclude that learning to predict a sufficient set of objects for a planning problem is a simple, powerful, and general mechanism for planning in large instances.

10.1609/aaai.v38i18.29990,GOALNET: Interleaving Neural Goal Predicate Inference with Classical Planning for Generalization in Robot Instruction Following,"Our goal is to enable a robot to learn how to sequence its actions to perform high-level tasks specified as natural language instructions, given successful demonstrations from a human partner. Our novel neuro-symbolic solution GOALNET builds an iterative two-step approach that interleaves (i) inferring next subgoal predicate implied by the language instruction, for a given world state, and (ii) synthesizing a feasible subgoal-reaching plan from that state. The agent executes the plan, and the two steps are repeated. GOALNET combines (i) learning, where dense representations are acquired for language instruction and the world state via a neural network prediction model, enabling generalization to novel settings and (ii) planning, where the cause-effect modeling by a classical planner eschews irrelevant predicates, facilitating multistage decision making in large domains. GOALNET obtains 78% improvement in the goal reaching rate in comparison to several state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark data with multi-stage instructions. Further, GOALNET can generalize to novel instructions for scenes with unseen objects.

10.1609/icaps.v34i1.31503,On the Prospects of Incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) in Automated Planning and Scheduling (APS),"Automated Planning and Scheduling is among the growing areas in Artificial Intelligence (AI) where mention of LLMs has gained popularity. Based on a comprehensive review of 126 papers, this paper investigates eight categories based on the unique applications of LLMs in addressing various aspects of planning problems: language translation, plan generation, model construction, multi-agent planning, interactive planning, heuristics optimization, tool integration, and brain-inspired planning. For each category, we articulate the issues considered and existing gaps. A critical insight resulting from our review is that the true potential of LLMs unfolds when they are integrated with traditional symbolic planners, pointing towards a promising neuro-symbolic approach. This approach effectively combines the generative aspects of LLMs with the precision of classical planning methods. By synthesizing insights from existing literature, we underline the potential of this integration to address complex planning challenges. We aim to keep the categorization of papers updated on https://ai4society.github.io/LLM-Planning-Viz/, a collaborative resource that allows researchers to contribute and add new literature to the categorization. © © 2024, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

To this end, we demonstrate a novel system that combines a computational model of question generation with a cognitive robotic architecture. The model supports dynamic production of back- and-forth dialogue for concept learning given observations of an environment, while the architecture supports symbolic reasoning, action representation, one-shot learning and other capabilities for situated interaction. The system is able to learn about new concepts including objects, locations, and actions, using an underlying approach that is generalizable and scalable.

In this context, ESA started the Harwell Robotics and Autonomy Facility (HRAF) project, whose main objective is to provide an effective support for the integration, validation and verification of autonomy components. The HRAF architecture is founded on both HLA (High Level Architecture) as a distributed simulation middleware, and the Distributed Simulation Engineering and Execution Process (DSEEP) as the adopted reference process for building HLA-based simulations. The current Pilot 3 phase of the HRAF development plan deals with the development and validation of a model-driven framework for supporting the semi-automated generation of HLA-based simulations.

10.23919/ACC45564.2020.9147498,Impact-Aware Online Motion Planning for Fully-Actuated Bipedal Robot Walking,"The ability to track a general walking path with specific timing is crucial to the operational safety and reliability of bipedal robots for avoiding dynamic obstacles, such as pedestrians, in complex environments. This paper introduces a motion planner that generates the desired full-body motion in real-time for fully-actuated bipedal robotic walking. The key novelty of the proposed planner lies in its capability of online generation of impact-aware non-periodic motions along general walking paths that respect the discrete impact behaviors. The planner is derived based on full-order modeling of hybrid walking dynamics and the proposed construction of keyframe posture library. Simulation results of a three-dimensional bipedal robot are presented to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed planner in generating full-body motions for each walking step within 0.6 second."
10.23919/ACC50511.2021.9483063,Closed-loop Reference Model based Distributed Model Reference Adaptive Control for Multi-agent Systems,"This paper confluences ideas from distributed model reference adaptive control (MRAC) architecture for multi-agent systems and closed-loop reference model (CRM) based MRAC algorithm. The concept of CRM is recently proposed in literature for single-agent MRAC problems, where the reference model (leader) gets feedback from the plant (agent/follower) to facilitate improved transient performance. This work coins the concept of CRM based distributed MRAC, where it is assumed that the leader/reference model is connected only to a subset of followers and incorporates feedback from them in a multi-agent setting. Distributed parameter estimator and controller are designed, which incorporate inter-agent cooperation via communication over a bi-directional graph. The leader state and the time-varying leader input (also known as reference input in MRAC literature) are only accessible to its neighbours. A novel distributed dynamic surface control (DSC)-like strategy is invoked for each follower to cooperatively estimate the unknown reference input required for control design. Simulation results dictate that the proposed closed-loop leader based formulation leads to better transient performance as compared to the status quo and also enables the use of high gain tuners for adaptive update law. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first work which introduces a distributed protocol of CRM-MRAC for multi-agent systems (CRM-DMRAC) with rigorous Lyapunov analysis."
10.23919/ACC63710.2025.11107796,Persistent Monitoring Trajectory Optimization in Partitioned Environments,"We consider the problem of using an autonomous agent to persistently monitor a collection of targets distributed in a given environment. We generalize existing work by allowing the agent’s dynamics to vary throughout the environment, leading to a hybrid dynamical system. This introduces an additional layer of complexity towards the planning portion of the problem: we must not only identify in which order to visit the points of interest, but also in which order to traverse the regions. We propose a tailored global path planner and prove that it is not only probabilistically complete, but converges in probability to a time-optimal solution. We then design an offline sequence planner together with an online trajectory optimizer. Simulations validate the results."

This paper proposes the foundation for preoperative segmentation based on two cascaded architectures of deep neural networks (DNN) based on the state-of-the-art nnU-Net. Additionally, this study introduces a polyvinyl alcohol cryogel (PVA-C) breast phantom based on the segmentation of the DNN automated approach, enabling the experiments of navigation systems for robotic breast surgery. Multi-modality breast MRI datasets of T2W and STIR images were acquired from 10 patients. Segmentation evaluation utilized the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), segmentation accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. First, a single class labeling was used to segment the breast region. Then it was employed as an input for three-class labeling to segment fat, fibroglandular (FGT) tissues, and tumorous lesions. The first architecture has a 0.95 DSC, while the second has a 0.95, 0.83, and 0.41 for fat, FGT, and tumor classes, respectively."
10.23919/APNOMS67058.2025.11181316,Intent-Driven Autonomous Reconfiguration for Telecom OSS: A Generative-AI-Empowered Hierarchical Multi-Agent Architecture,"Telecom Operation Support Systems (OSS) still depend on domain experts and ad-hoc scripts for network and service reconfiguration, a process that is labor-intensive, errorprone, and fragile whenever cross-domain dependencies-such as allocating an IP address before tearing down a VLAN—must be respected. The heterogeneity and dynamism anticipated for 6Gclass networks only magnify the shortcomings of today’s rigid, rule-based automation pipelines. This paper introduces an intent-driven, fully autonomous reconfiguration framework that integrates Generative AI with a hierarchical Multi-Agent architecture. At its core, a ReWOOenhanced Chief Agent transforms natural-language intents into a dependency-aware execution graph, utilizing a formally defined Command Pattern to explicitly specify actions and associated data for unambiguous inter-agent coordination. Atomic tasks-annotated with domain-specific constraints and keys governed by a Primary Key Pattern-are delegated to ReAct-based Specific Agents responsible for IP management, network control, cloud orchestration, and service management. Evaluation on a four-domain OSS testbed exposing over thirty RESTful APIs confirms accurate intent parsing, robust key-value consistency enforcement, strict adherence to create-before-destroy constraints, and seamless scalability from single-domain provisioning to complex cross-domain orchestration without code changes. The proposed work delivers a reusable agent blueprint decoupling global planning from domain execution; formal interagent interfaces curbing hallucination and enabling modular growth; an execution-aware extension to ReWOO for structured action planning; domain-driven guidelines for encapsulating OSS subsystems into loosely coupled agents; and a public OSS testbed for benchmarking future Agentic-AI architectures-collectively advancing OSS reconfiguration toward scalable, maintainable, and 6G-ready network operations."

Firstly, by introducing spatial attention mechanism, positional attention mechanism and channel attention mechanism, a hybrid attention module is designed. This module not only establishes feature relationship between different locations, but also provides adaptive feature weights to highlight key information. Next, by embedding the hybrid attention module into the generative adversarial network, an improved generative adversarial network model is developed.

This paper considers a multi-robot task allocation and path planning problem in RMFS and proposes a hybrid method by combining a Genetic algorithm (GA) with a Hierarchical Cooperative A * (HCA*) algorithm. The GA generates several task sequences as targets for path planning, and the HCA* successfully finds a collision-free path for several mobile robots while considering the optimization of the makespan and flowtime of the entire order. For the narrow aisle in storge areas, we allow the mobile robots to wait in place and provide a simple heuristic method for HCA* to arrange priorities for mobile robots. The results of the simulation experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Dynamic multi-objective task allocation is achieved by the Contract Net Protocol. An improved Bee Colony Potential Field hybrid algorithm is proposed to plan trajectory dynamically for individual agent. Building upon grouping and trajectory information, an improved Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm, combined with Bezier curve, is utilized under a leader-follower model for swarm trajectory optimization.

This study proposes a multi-agent solution to solve the task of electric vehicle allocation on smart grid chargers sensitive to the vehicle's base, destination and battery profile for charging convenience. In particular, we assess robustness against irrational vehicle behavior and unstable power supply. The proposal follows a design science research methodology. We consider an unstable power source and agents with emotional behaviours, such as irrational preconception of stations and individual perceptions experience.

10.23919/CSMS.2023.0017,Towards Efficient Robotic Software Development by Reusing Behavior Tree Structures for Task Planning Paradigms,"Nowadays, autonomous robots are expected to accomplish more complex tasks and operate in an open-world environment with uncertainties. Developing software for such robots involves the design of task planning paradigms and the implementation of robotic software architectures, making software development rather tricky and time-consuming. In recent decades, component-based software development approaches have been increasingly adopted in robotics to improve software development efficiency by reusing data and controlling flows between components. However, few works have tackled the more critical issue of reusing complex high-level task planning paradigms and robotic software architectures. To make up for the limitation, this paper first identifies the mainstream task planning paradigms and proposes a set of novel patterns for interaction pipelines between the robotic functions of sensing, planning, and acting. Then this paper presents a novel Behavior Tree (BT) based development framework Structural-BT, which provides a set of reusable BT structures that implement abstract interaction pipelines while maintaining interfaces for task-specific customization. The Structural-BT framework supports the modular design of structure functionalities and allows easy extensibility of the inner planning flows between BT components. With the Structural-BT framework, software engineers can develop robotic software by flexibly composing BT structures to formulate the skeleton software architecture and implement task-specific algorithms when necessary. In the experiment, this paper develops robotic software for diverse task scenarios and selects the baseline approaches of Robot Operating System (ROS) and classical BT development frameworks for comparison. By quantitatively measuring the reuse frequencies and ratios of BT structures, the Structural-BT framework has been shown to be more efficient than the baseline approaches for robotic software development."
10.23919/DATE51398.2021.9474167,A containerized ROS-compliant verification environment for robotic systems,"This paper proposes an architecture and a related automatic flow to generate, orchestrate and deploy a ROS-compliant verification environment for robotic systems. The architecture enables assertion-based verification by exploiting monitors automatically synthesized from LTL assertions. The monitors are encapsulated in plug-and-play ROS nodes that do not require any modification to the system under verification (SUV). To guarantee both verification accuracy and real-time constraints of the system in a resource-constrained environment even after the monitor integration, we define a novel approach to move the monitor evaluation across the different layers of an edge-to-cloud computing platform. The verification environment is containerized for both cloud and edge computing using Docker to enable system portability and to handle, at run-time, the resources allocated for verification. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed architecture have been evaluated on a complex distributed system implementing a mobile robot path planner based on 3D simultaneous localization and mapping."

The negotiation agent is located in the upper layer of a hierarchical control architecture to achieve a consensus between the different local MPC controllers, providing weighting coefficients for the negotiation process between the control sequences provided by the local controllers. The training algorithm for the reinforcement learning of this agent is the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DDPG). The validation of the negotiation agent has been performed successfully both in simulation and in a real laboratory plant composed of eight coupled water tanks, which is a non-linear system characterized by high interaction between subsystems."
10.23919/ELECO54474.2021.9677568,A Low-Cost 3D-Printed Soft Pneumatic Actuator,"Soft actuators have recently gained popularity due to their advantages over rigid actuators, such as contact compliance, endurance against mechanical failure, and better compatibility for human-machine interaction. They enable robots to handle fragile objects safely and interact with their environments effectively. However, the production of cost-effective soft actuators is challenging due to the complex manufacturing procedures of complex actuator architecture. In this study, a custom-made 3D printer has been developed for printing flexible filaments to produce pneumatic silicone actuators. First, soft pneumatic actuators with programmable bending motions were designed, and this capability was characterized through FEM simulations using ANSYS Mechanical. Then, these actuators were 3D printed and tested under the same conditions used in simulations to validate their characteristics. The results showed that the simulations and actual experiments were in good agreement. In the future, we are planning to produce soft pneumatic robotic grippers by combining three of the proposed soft actuators."
10.23919/ICCAS55662.2022.10003798,Toward an automatic diagnostic scanning robotic system using ultrasound images,"Ultrasonography is widely used for the diagnosis of various diseases. To obtain a clear view of the ultrasound image, an examiner needs to press the ultrasound (US) probe with a constant press and move smoothly and continuously. To mitigate the workload and prepare the remote treatment, there has been a demand for an automatic diagnostic scanning robotic system (ADSRS) using US images. For the complete ADSRS, the target localization, path planning, robot control, and US image analysis need to be addressed. This paper explains mainly the robot control part as the preliminary research toward ADSRS. A simple path was selected within a predefined inspection area as the preliminary work and the selected path was converted from the camera coordinates into the robot coordinates. Both the position and orientation of the US probe were used as the desired path. For the robot control, hybrid force-positon control was implemented to guarantee the quality of US images and the safety of patients. For the position control, the built-in Cartesian impedance control and null space control were utilized to control the 7-degree-of-ffeedom (7-DOF) manipulator. For the force control, the basic proportional control was implemented, and it was integrated with the aforementioned position control system. The experimental evaluation was conducted by using a 7-DOF manipulator with a joint torque sensor at each joint after attaching a US probe and a 3-dimensional (3-D) camera to an end-effector. The simple path over the surface of the skin of the patient was generated successfully, and the desired force during movement was set to 5N. The error is measured to $0.3144\pm 0.4853$ N. The proposed system shows sufficient performance in the robot control part and the path planning part."
10.23919/ICCAS59377.2023.10316801,Novel Bio-Inspired Artificial Muscle Using Shape Memory Alloy Wire in Spiral Winding,"Recently, soft actuators have emerged as crucial components in the design of bio-inspired applications such as: exosuits and wearable robots, providing promising capabilities to replicate human-like movement and improving the functionality of robotic systems. This paper presents the design of a novel artificial muscle utilizing a single wire of shape memory alloy (SMA) wound in a spiral pattern. The actuator consists of two spiral windings of a single continuous SMA wire in two parallel plans (plan A and Plan B). Two groups of roller bearings are arranged in two halves of hexagons shapes for the guidance of the SMA wire in the two spiral shapes, enabling SMA spiral winding, while a third group of roller bearings are movable in middle output stage. This output stage is strategically placed between the two SMA spirals, enabling output motion. When the SMA wire is heated, it contracts, resulting in linear motion of the movable part along the axle (maximum stroke of 25 mm, and maximum load of 7 kgf). The displacement and force exerted by the actuator are adapted by adjusting the length of the SMA wire and the configuration of the output pulleys. Upon cooling, the movable part returns to its initial position under external loading. Moreover, system identification and PID control techniques are employed to enhance the actuator's control performance. Experimental tests conducted in both open-loop and closed-loop controls validate the actuator's ability to successfully follow desired trajectories. The key contribution of this work lies in the novel spiral architecture, which offers a vital and practical solution to deal with the limitations related to size and strain of the SMA wire while leveraging the unique properties of SMA technology."

Underwater inspection operations are performed by work-class ROVs equipped with robotic manipulators. The ROV generally travel at pre-planned paths extracting features from the environment, usually detected by a visual sensor. A monocular hybrid position based visual servoing (PBVS) system for underwater inspection on Work-class ROVs with a camera mounted on the manipulator and other on the top of the ROV is proposed.

10.24963/ijcai.2025/214,SketchAgent: Generating Structured Diagrams from Hand-Drawn Sketches,"Hand-drawn sketches are a natural and efficient medium for capturing and conveying ideas. Despite significant advancements in controllable natural image generation, translating freehand sketches into structured, machine-readable diagrams remains a labor-intensive and predominantly manual task. The primary challenge stems from the inherent ambiguity of sketches, which lack the structural constraints and semantic precision required for automated diagram generation. To address this challenge, we introduce SketchAgent, a multiagent system designed to automate the transformation of hand-drawn sketches into structured diagrams. SketchAgent integrates sketch recognition, symbolic reasoning, and iterative validation to produce semantically coherent and structurally accurate diagrams, significantly reducing the need for manual effort. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the Sketch2Diagram Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework encompassing eight diverse diagram categories, such as flowcharts, directed graphs, and model architectures. The dataset comprises over 6,000 high-quality examples with token-level annotations, standardized preprocessing, and rigorous quality control. By streamlining the diagram generation process, SketchAgent holds great promise for applications in design, education, and engineering, while offering a significant step toward bridging the gap between intuitive sketching and machine-readable diagram generation. © 2025 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

10.3233/FAIA240636,A Practical Operational Semantics for Classical Planning in BDI Agents,"Implementations of the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) architecture have a long tradition in the development of autonomous agent systems. However, most practical implementations of the BDI framework rely on a pre-defined plan library for decision-making, which places a significant burden on programmers, and still yields systems that may be brittle, struggling to achieve their goals in dynamic environments. This paper overcomes this limitation by introducing an operational semantics for BDI systems that rely on Classical Planning at run time to both cope with failures that were unforeseeable and synthesise new plans that were unspecified at design time. This semantics places particular emphasis on the interaction of the reasoning cycle and an underlying planning algorithm. We empirically demonstrate the practical feasibility and generality of such an approach in an implementation of this semantics within two popular BDI platforms together with in-depth computational evaluation. © 2024 The Authors."
10.3233/IA-240036,Planning and learning to perceive in partially unknown environments,"For applying symbolic planning, an agent acting in an environment needs to know its symbolic state, and an abstract model of the environment dynamics. However, in the real world, an agent has low-level perceptions of the environment (e.g. its position given by a GPS sensor), rather than symbolic observations representing its current state. Furthermore, in many real-world scenarios, it is not feasible to provide an agent with a complete and correct model of the environment, e.g., when the environment is (partially) unknown a priori. Therefore, agents need to dynamically learn/adapt/extend their perceptual abilities online, in an autonomous way, by exploring and interacting with the environment where they operate. In this paper, we provide a general architecture of a planning, learning, and acting agent. Moreover, we propose solutions to the problems of automatically training a neural network to recognize object properties, learning the situations where such properties are better perceivable, and planning to get into such situations. We experimentally show the effectiveness of our approach in simulated and complex environments, and we empirically demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in a real-world scenario that involves noisy perceptions and noisy actions on a real robot. © 2024 - IOS Press.

10.3233/ICA-200624,Semantic visual recognition in a cognitive architecture for social robots,"Cognitive architectures allow robots to perform their operations by drawing on a process that aims to simulate human reasoning. This paper presents an integrated semantic artificial memory system in cognitive architecture based on symbolic reasoning and a connective representation of the knowledge. This memory system attempts to simulate how humans learn to distinguish instances of particular objects within their class using a convolutional network to detect the relevant elements of an image. We use a vector with the extracted features to learn to discriminate an instance of another element from the same class. A novel feature of our approach is its autonomous learning process during the operation of the robot, integrating a deep learning embedding with a statistical classifier. The usefulness and robustness of this method are demonstrated by applying it to a social robot that learns to differentiate people. Finally, experiments are carried out to validate our approach, comparing the detection results with several alternative methods. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved."
10.3389/fnbot.2024.1342786,A framework for neurosymbolic robot action planning using large language models,"Symbolic task planning is a widely used approach to enforce robot autonomy due to its ease of understanding and deployment in engineered robot architectures. However, techniques for symbolic task planning are difficult to scale in real-world, highly dynamic, human-robot collaboration scenarios because of the poor performance in planning domains where action effects may not be immediate, or when frequent re-planning is needed due to changed circumstances in the robot workspace. The validity of plans in the long term, plan length, and planning time could hinder the robot's efficiency and negatively affect the overall human-robot interaction's fluency. We present a framework, which we refer to as Teriyaki, specifically aimed at bridging the gap between symbolic task planning and machine learning approaches. The rationale is training Large Language Models (LLMs), namely GPT-3, into a neurosymbolic task planner compatible with the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), and then leveraging its generative capabilities to overcome a number of limitations inherent to symbolic task planners. Potential benefits include (i) a better scalability in so far as the planning domain complexity increases, since LLMs' response time linearly scales with the combined length of the input and the output, instead of super-linearly as in the case of symbolic task planners, and (ii) the ability to synthesize a plan action-by-action instead of end-to-end, and to make each action available for execution as soon as it is generated instead of waiting for the whole plan to be available, which in turn enables concurrent planning and execution. In the past year, significant efforts have been devoted by the research community to evaluate the overall cognitive capabilities of LLMs, with alternate successes. Instead, with Teriyaki we aim to providing an overall planning performance comparable to traditional planners in specific planning domains, while leveraging LLMs capabilities in other metrics, specifically those related to their short- and mid-term generative capabilities, which are used to build a look-ahead predictive planning model. Preliminary results in selected domains show that our method can: (i) solve 95.5% of problems in a test data set of 1,000 samples; (ii) produce plans up to 13.5% shorter than a traditional symbolic planner; (iii) reduce average overall waiting times for a plan availability by up to 61.4%. © © 2024 Capitanelli and Mastrogiovanni."
10.3389/frobt.2023.1221739,Learning to reason over scene graphs: a case study of finetuning GPT-2 into a robot language model for grounded task planning,"Long-horizon task planning is essential for the development of intelligent assistive and service robots. In this work, we investigate the applicability of a smaller class of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-2, in robotic task planning by learning to decompose tasks into subgoal specifications for a planner to execute sequentially. Our method grounds the input of the LLM on the domain that is represented as a scene graph, enabling it to translate human requests into executable robot plans, thereby learning to reason over long-horizon tasks, as encountered in the ALFRED benchmark. We compare our approach with classical planning and baseline methods to examine the applicability and generalizability of LLM-based planners. Our findings suggest that the knowledge stored in an LLM can be effectively grounded to perform long-horizon task planning, demonstrating the promising potential for the future application of neuro-symbolic planning methods in robotics. © © 2023 Chalvatzaki, Younes, Nandha, Le, Ribeiro and Gurevych."
10.3389/frobt.2025.1566623,Hybrid intelligence systems for reliable automation: advancing knowledge work and autonomous operations with scalable AI architectures,"Introduction: Mission-critical automation demands decision-making that is explainable, adaptive, and scalable—attributes elusive to purely symbolic or data-driven approaches. We introduce a hybrid intelligence (H-I) system that fuses symbolic reasoning with advanced machine learning via a hierarchical architecture, inspired by cognitive frameworks like Global Workspace Theory (Baars, A Cognitive Theory of Consciousness, 1988). Methods: This architecture operates across three levels to achieve autonomous, end-to-end workflows: Navigation: Using Vision Transformers, and graph-based neural networks, the system navigates file systems, databases, and software interfaces with precision. Discrete Actions: Multi-framework automated machine learning (AutoML) trains agents to execute discrete decisions, augmented by Transformers and Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) (Assran et al., 2023, 15619–15629) for complex time-series analysis, such as anomaly detection. Planning: Reinforcement learning, world model-based reinforcement learning, and model predictive control orchestrate adaptive workflows tailored to user requests or live system demands. Results: The system’s capabilities are demonstrated in two mission-critical applications: Space Domain Awareness, Satellite Behavior Detection: A graph-based JEPA paired with multi-agent reinforcement learning enables near real-time anomaly detection across 15,000 on-orbit objects, delivering a precision-recall score of 0.98. Autonomously Driven Simulation Setup: The system autonomously configures Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) setups, with an AutoML-driven optimizer enhancing the meshing step—boosting boundary layer capture propagation (BL-CP) from 8% to 98% and cutting geometry failure rates from 88% to 2% on novel aircraft geometries. Scalability is a cornerstone, with the distributed training pipeline achieving linear scaling across 2,000 compute nodes for AI model training, while secure model aggregation incurs less than 4% latency in cross-domain settings. Discussion: By blending symbolic precision with data-driven adaptability, this hybrid intelligence system offers a robust, transferable framework for automating complex knowledge work in domains like space operations and engineering simulations—and adjacent applications such as autonomous energy and industrial facility operations, paving the way for next-generation industrial AI systems. © © 2025 Grosvenor, Zemlyansky, Wahab, Bohachov, Dogan and Deighan."
10.3390/app152011107,Interactive Environment-Aware Planning System and Dialogue for Social Robots in Early Childhood Education,"In this study, we propose an interactive environment-aware dialog and planning system for social robots in early childhood education, aimed at supporting the learning and social interaction of young children. The proposed architecture consists of three core modules. First, semantic simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) accurately perceives the environment by constructing a semantic scene representation that includes attributes such as position, size, color, purpose, and material of objects, as well as their positional relationships. Second, the automated planning system enables stable task execution even in changing environments through planning domain definition language (PDDL)-based planning and replanning capabilities. Third, the visual question answering module leverages scene graphs and SPARQL conversion of natural language queries to answer children’s questions and engage in context-based conversations. The experiment conducted in a real kindergarten classroom with children aged 6 to 7 years validated the accuracy of object recognition and attribute extraction for semantic SLAM, the task success rate of the automated planning system, and the natural language question answering performance of the visual question answering (VQA) module.The experimental results confirmed the proposed system’s potential to support natural social interaction with children and its applicability as an educational tool. © 2025 by the authors."

This study presents a NeuroSymbolic robotic system for battery disassembly, driven by autonomous learning capabilities. The system integrates deep perception modules, symbolic reasoning, and action primitives to achieve interpretable and efficient disassembly. To improve adaptability, we introduce an offline learning framework driven by a large language model (LLM), which analyzes historical disassembly trajectories and generates optimized action sequences via prompt-based reasoning. This enables the synthesis of new action primitives tailored to familiar scenarios. The system is validated on a real-world UR10e robotic platform across various battery configurations. Experimental results show a 17 s reduction in average disassembly time per bolt and a 154.4% improvement in overall efficiency compared with traditional approaches. These findings demonstrate that combining neural perception, symbolic reasoning, and LLM-guided learning significantly enhances robotic disassembly performance and offers strong potential for generalization in future battery recycling applications. © 2025 by the authors."

This review synthesizes more than a decade of progress in vision-based robotic navigation through an engineering lens, charting the full pipeline from sensing to deployment. We first examine the expanding sensor palette—monocular and multi-camera rigs, stereo and RGB-D devices, LiDAR–camera hybrids, event cameras, and infrared systems—highlighting the complementary operating envelopes and the rise of learning-based depth inference. The advances in visual localization and mapping are then analyzed, contrasting sparse and dense SLAM approaches, as well as monocular, stereo, and visual–inertial formulations. Additional topics include loop closure, semantic mapping, and LiDAR–visual–inertial fusion, which enables drift-free operation in dynamic environments. Building on these foundations, we review the navigation and control strategies, spanning classical planning, reinforcement and imitation learning, hybrid topological–metric memories, and emerging visual language guidance. Application case studies—autonomous driving, industrial manipulation, autonomous underwater vehicles, planetary rovers, aerial drones, and humanoids—demonstrate how tailored sensor suites and algorithms meet domain-specific constraints.

10.3390/s20226520,An automated planning model for hri: Use cases on social assistive robotics,"Using Automated Planning for the high level control of robotic architectures is becoming very popular thanks mainly to its capability to define the tasks to perform in a declarative way. However, classical planning tasks, even in its basic standard Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) format, are still very hard to formalize for non expert engineers when the use case to model is complex. Human Robot Interaction (HRI) is one of those complex environments. This manuscript describes the rationale followed to design a planning model able to control social autonomous robots interacting with humans. It is the result of the authors’ experience in modeling use cases for Social Assistive Robotics (SAR) in two areas related to healthcare: Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) and non-contact rehabilitation therapies for patients with physical impairments. In this work a general definition of these two use cases in a unique planning domain is proposed, which favors the management and integration with the software robotic architecture, as well as the addition of new use cases. Results show that the model is able to capture all the relevant aspects of the Human-Robot interaction in those scenarios, allowing the robot to autonomously perform the tasks by using a standard planning-execution architecture. © 2020 by the authors.

10.3390/s25175282,Comparative Benchmark of Sampling-Based and DRL Motion Planning Methods for Industrial Robotic Arms,"This study presents a comprehensive comparison between classical sampling-based motion planners from the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) and a learning-based planner based on Soft Actor–Critic (SAC) for motion planning in industrial robotic arms. Using a UR3e robot equipped with an RG2 gripper, we constructed a large-scale dataset of over 100,000 collision-free trajectories generated with MoveIt-integrated OMPL planners. These trajectories were used to train a DRL agent via curriculum learning and expert demonstrations. Both approaches were evaluated on key metrics such as planning time, success rate, and trajectory smoothness. Results show that the DRL-based planner achieves higher success rates and significantly lower planning times, producing more compact and deterministic trajectories. Time-optimal parameterization using TOPPRA ensured the dynamic feasibility of all trajectories. While classical planners retain advantages in zero-shot adaptability and environmental generality, our findings highlight the potential of DRL for real-time and high-throughput motion planning in industrial contexts. This work provides practical insights into the trade-offs between traditional and learning-based planning paradigms, paving the way for hybrid architectures that combine their strengths. © 2025 by the authors."
10.3390/s25206476,Probabilistic Sampling Networks for Hybrid Structure Planning in Semi-Structured Environments,"Highlights: What are the main findings? A hybrid structure planning method based on a Probabilistic Sampling Network (PSNet) and an Enhanced Artificial Potential Field (EAPF) is proposed to address high-dimensional robot motion planning in semi-structured environments. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms MPNet and RRT-Connect in both 2-D point-mass robot and 6-DOF manipulator tasks, achieving higher success rates and more stable collision avoidance. What is the implication of the main finding? The proposed approach enhances the adaptability and robustness of industrial robots in intelligent manufacturing, maintaining efficient path planning in dynamic and complex scenarios. This study provides a new perspective for integrating learning-based methods with classical planning techniques, laying the foundation for future applications in autonomous robotic operations and human–robot collaboration. The advancement of adaptable industrial robots in intelligent manufacturing is hindered by the inefficiency of traditional motion planning methods in high-dimensional spaces. Therefore, a Dempster–Shafer evidence theory-based hybrid motion planner is proposed, in which a probabilistic sampling network (PSNet) and an enhanced artificial potential field (EAPF) cooperate with each other to improve the planning performance. The PSNet architecture comprises two modules: a motion planning module (MPM) and a fusion sampling module (FSM). The MPM utilizes sensor data alongside the robot’s current and target configurations to recursively generate diverse multimodal distributions of the next configuration. Based on the distribution information, the FSM was used as a decision-maker to ultimately generate globally connectable paths. Moreover, the FSM is equipped to correct collision path points caused by network inaccuracies through Gaussian resampling. Simultaneously, an augmented artificial potential field with a dynamic rotational field is deployed to repair local paths when worst-case collision scenarios occur. This collaborative strategy harmoniously unites the complementary strengths of both components, thereby enhancing the overall resilience and adaptability of the motion planning system. Experiments were conducted in various environments. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can quickly find directly connectable paths in diverse environments while reliably avoiding sudden obstacles. © 2025 by the authors."
10.3390/su15076251,A Digital Twin-Based Distributed Manufacturing Execution System for Industry 4.0 with AI-Powered On-The-Fly Replanning Capabilities,"Industry 4.0 smart production systems comprise industrial systems and subsystems that need to be integrated in such a way that they are able to support high modularity and reconfigurability of all system components. In today’s industrial production, manufacturing execution systems (MESs) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are typically in charge of orchestrating and monitoring automated production processes. This article explicates an MES architecture that is capable of autonomously composing, verifying, interpreting, and executing production plans using digital twins and symbolic planning methods. To support more efficient production, the proposed solution assumes that the manufacturing process can be started with an initial production plan that may be relatively inefficient but quickly found by an AI. While executing this initial plan, the AI searches for more efficient alternatives and forwards better solutions to the proposed MES, which is able to seamlessly switch between the currently executed plan and the new plan, even during production. Further, this on-the-fly replanning capability is also applicable when newly identified production circumstances/objectives appear, such as a malfunctioning robot, material shortage, or a last-minute change to a customizable product. Another feature of the proposed MES solution is its distributed operation with multiple instances. Each instance can interpret its part of the production plan, dedicated to a location within the entire production site. All of these MES instances are continuously synchronized, and the actual global or partial (i.e., from the instance perspective) progress of the production is handled in real-time within one common digital twin. This article presents three main contributions: (i) an execution system that is capable of switching seamlessly between an original and a subsequently introduced alternative production plan, (ii) on-the-fly AI-powered planning and replanning of industrial production integrated into a digital twin, and (iii) a distributed MES, which allows for running multiple instances that may depend on topology or specific conditions of a real production plant. All of these outcomes are demonstrated and validated on a use-case utilizing an Industry 4.0 testbed, which is equipped with an automated transport system and several industrial robots. While our solution is tested on a lab-sized production system, the technological base is prepared to be scaled up to larger systems. © 2023 by the authors."
10.3934/mbe.2025112,Adaptive Neuro-Symbolic framework with dynamic contextual reasoning: A novel framework for semantic understanding,"Despite significant advances in image processing, achieving human-like semantic understanding and explainability remains a formidable challenge. Current deep learning models excel at feature extraction but lack the ability to reason about relationships, interpret context, or provide transparent decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose the adaptive neuro-symbolic framework with dynamic contextual reasoning (ANS-DCR), a novel architecture that seamlessly integrates neural networks with symbolic reasoning. ANS-DCR introduces four key innovations: 1) A contextual embedding layer (CEL) that dynamically converts neural features into structured symbolic embeddings tailored to the scene’s context; 2) hierarchical knowledge graphs (HKGs) that encode multi-level object relationships and update in real-time on the basis of neural feedback; 3) an adaptive reasoning engine (ARE) that performs scalable, context-aware logical reasoning; and 4) an explainable decision-making module (EDM) that generates human-readable explanations, including counterfactuals, enhancing interpretability. This framework bridges the gap between pattern recognition and logical reasoning, enabling deeper semantic understanding and dynamic adaptability. We demonstrate ANS-DCR’s efficacy in complex scenarios such as autonomous driving, where it accurately interprets traffic scenes, predicts behaviors, and provides clear explanations for decisions. Experimental results show superior performance in semantic segmentation, contextual reasoning, and explainability compared with state-of-the-art methods. By combining the strengths of neural and symbolic paradigms, ANS-DCR sets a new benchmark for intelligent, transparent, and scalable image processing systems, offering transformative potential for applications in robotics, healthcare, and beyond.

We introduce an end-to-end, platform-agnostic robotic pipeline for autonomous disease detection and treatment systems, with a specific focus on cassava leaves as an example. The pipeline integrates a vision-language perception module based on a pretrained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, fine-tuned on an augmented dataset of cassava leaf images for disease detection. High-level task planning is performed by a Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), which interprets perception outputs and generates symbolic action plans (e.g., navigate to target, perform treatment). The low-level control system is implemented in the PyBullet dynamic simulator. We evaluated a vision-language model (VLM) perception and a Large Language Model (LLM) based planning system (in a virtual environment with predefined 3D coordinates for plant and spray positions). The VLM achieved 83% classification accuracy in simulation and real-time tests with a static camera produced classification accuracies of 70% Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD), 65% Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) and 52% Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB), and under dynamic camera it achieve the accuracy of 65% (CBSD), 52% (CMD), and 32% (CBB).

10.55417/fr.2022045,Towards Automated Sample Collection and Return in Extreme Underwater Environments,"In this report, we present the system design, operational strategy, and results of coordinated multivehicle field demonstrations of autonomous marine robotic technologies in search-for-life missions within the Pacific shelf margin of Costa Rica and the Santorini-Kolumbo caldera complex, which serve as analogs to environments that may exist in oceans beyond Earth. This report focuses on the automation of remotely operated vehicle (ROV) manipulator operations for targeted biological sample-collection-and-return from the seafloor. In the context of future extraterrestrial exploration missions to ocean worlds, an ROV is an analog to a planetary lander, which must be capable of high-level autonomy. Our field trials involve two underwater vehicles, the SuBastian ROV and the Nereid Under Ice (NUI) hybrid ROV for mixed initiative (i.e., teleoperated or autonomous) missions, both equipped seven-degrees-of-freedom hydraulic manipulators. We describe an adaptable, hardware-independent computer vision architecture that enables high-level automated manipulation. The vision system provides a three-dimensional understanding of the workspace to inform manipulator motion planning in complex unstructured environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the vision system and control framework through field trials in increasingly challenging environments, including the automated collection and return of biological samples from within the active undersea volcano Kolumbo. Based on our experiences in the field, we discuss the performance of our system and identify promising directions for future research."
10.5555/3378680.3378739,Language-capable robots may inadvertently weaken human moral norms,"Previous research in moral psychology and human-robot interaction has shown that technology shapes human morality, and research in human-robot interaction has shown that humans naturally perceive robots as moral agents. Accordingly, we propose that language-capable autonomous robots are uniquely positioned among technologies to significantly impact human morality. We therefore argue that it is imperative that language-capable robots behave according to human moral norms and communicate in such a way that their intention to adhere to those norms is clear. Unfortunately, the design of current natural language oriented robot architectures enables certain architectural components to circumvent or preempt those architectures' moral reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we show how this may occur, using clarification request generation in current dialog systems as a motivating example. Furthermore, we present experimental evidence that the types of behavior exhibited by current approaches to clarification request generation can cause robots to (1) miscommunicate their moral intentions and (2) weaken humans' perceptions of moral norms within the current context. This work strengthens previous preliminary findings, and does so within an experimental paradigm that provides increased external and ecological validity over earlier approaches."
10.5555/3382225.3382387,Enhancing diffusion models by embedding cognitive reasoning,"Diffusion models are powerful tools for understanding the spread of diverse content such as information, opinions and ideas through social networks. Although these models have been successfully used to study the spreading dynamics such as viral marketing, there are many real scenarios (e.g. vaccination, evacuation) that require a more complex model. Hence, we propose a new hybrid framework that combines diffusion modelling with cognitive agent modelling. The hybrid, generic framework is grounded on BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention), an advanced, efficient cognitive agent framework. We demonstrate our framework to a wildfire evacuation case study consisting of 5,000 agents. We then compare and analyse the diffusion outcomes of our model against two baseline models, the standard Linear Threshold (LT) model and a slightly modified version of the LT model, across 17 different input configurations. The results show (statistically) significant differences with the baselines for the majority of the configurations, highlighting the need for cognitive agents in diffusion modelling. The framework presented here provides the basis for modelling complex reasoning to capture diffusion phenomena in complex and dynamic social systems."
10.5555/3398761.3398771,Explainable Multi Agent Path Finding,"Multi Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of planning paths for agents to reach their targets from their start locations, such that the agents do not collide while executing the plan. In safety-critical systems, the plan is typically checked by a human supervisor, who decides on whether to allow its execution. In such cases, we wish to convince the human that the plan is indeed collision free.To this end, we propose an explanation scheme for MAPF, which bases explanations on simplicity of visual verification by human's cognitive process. The scheme decomposes a plan into segments such that within each segment, the paths of the agents are disjoint. Then, we can convince the supervisor that the plan is collision free using a small number of images (dubbed an explanation). In addition, we can measure the simplicity of a plan by the number of segments required for the decomposition. We study the complexity of algorithmic problems that arise by the explanation scheme, as well as the tradeoff between the length (makespan) of a plan and its minimal decomposition. We also provide experimental results of our scheme both in a continuous and in a discrete setting."
10.5555/3398761.3398896,Human-Centered Decision Support for Agenda Scheduling,"Over the course of a day, people often attend many appointments, like meetings or doctor's appointments, with time and location constraints, as well as perform other tasks like stopping by the grocery store with only location constraints. Optimally scheduling the day's agenda typically requires a high cognitive load, where people reason about all their constraints at once. An agent that aids a person in scheduling the day's agenda can potentially reduce the stress associated with scheduling but must be able to 1) perform fast updates and 2) produce new agendas that can be readily understood by the people they are helping. In order to understand how people reason about agenda changes, we first performed a study where participants are asked to perform a series of scheduling tasks and captured their update strategy both subjectively (self-reporting) and objectively (by tracking their reasoning). Our results that show that people use spatial cues and meeting time information to reduce the rescheduling task to a more reasonable size. We then present a novel heuristic for adding tasks to agendas that targets rescheduling to clusters of appointments that are spatio-temporally near the new task.We show that this heuristic approach always finds the optimal solution, while greatly reducing rescheduling time, and performs rescheduling in a way that is similar to our participants' strategies."
10.5555/3398761.3399115,Competence-Aware Systems for Long-Term Autonomy,"Recent years have seen a push towards deploying fully autonomous robots in large, complex domains such as autonomous driving, space exploration, and service robots. However, legal, ethical, or technical constraints have limited the extent of these systems' employable autonomy. In order to successfully achieve their intended goals, these systems must utilize assistance from humans to compensate for their limitations. For such systems to be successful over the course of a long-term deployment, they must both be cognizant of their own competence and have the ability to improve this competence over time in a safe way. Motivated by practical concerns faced in industry, this thesis provides a formal model for such a human-agent system to reason about its own competence and aims in future work to provide effective ways of safely improving the competence of the system over the course of its deployment."
10.5555/3400397.3400437,STTAR: a simheuristics-enabled scheme for multi-stakeholder coordination of aircraft turnaround operations,"Aircraft turnaround operations involve all services to an aircraft (e.g. passenger boarding/disembarking, re-fuelling, deicing) between its arrival and immediately following departure. The aircraft, parked at its stand, witnesses a number of service providers move around it to perform their duties. These companies run substantially independent operations, working for different airlines/flights within a confined area where many resources, including physical space itself, have inescapably to be shared. Inter-dependencies among service providers abound, and knock-on effects at disrupted times are rife. Coordination from the side of the airport operator is difficult. We envisage a tactical robust scheme whereby ground handlers and the airport operator cooperate, albeit indirectly, in the development of plans for the next day that are less likely to be impacted by at least the more frequent operational disruptions. The scheme is based on a simheuristic approach which integrates ad-hoc heuristics with a hybrid simulation model (agent-based/discrete-event)."
10.5555/3400397.3400507,Hybrid system modeling approach for the depiction of the energy consumption in production simulations,"In many industrial manufacturing companies, energy has become a major cost factor. Energy aspects are included in the decision-making system of production planning and control to reduce manufacturing costs. For this priority, the simulation of production processes requires not only the consideration of logistical and technical production factors but also the integration of time-dependent energy flows which are continuous in nature. A hybrid simulation, using a continuous approach to depict the energy demand of production processes in combination with a discrete approach to map the material flows and logistic processes, shows the complex interactions between material flow and energy usage in production closer to reality. This paper presents a hybrid simulation approach combining System Dynamics, Discrete-Event and Agent-Based Simulation for energy efficiency analysis in production, considering the energy consumption in the context of planning and scheduling operations and applying it to a use-case scenario of mechanical processing of die-cast parts."
10.5555/3400397.3400605,A distributed agent-based framework for a constellation of drones in a military operation,"A seamless communication capability is important in military operations. Likewise, enhanced security, increased capacity, and robust communication mechanisms are vital for humanitarian and disaster-response operations. Often, a system of wide-band satellites is employed for real-time exchange of information and over-the-horizon control, but the communications are prone to denial of service (DoS) attacks, and delayed redeployment. Hence, a swarm of drones could be deployed in mission-critical operations in times of urgency for a secured and robust distributed-intercommunication which is essential for survivability and successful completion of missions. In this paper, a distributed-agent-based framework for secure and reliable information exchange between drones in a constellation is proposed. The framework comprises a mechanism for path planning simulation and estimation, a flexible network architecture for improved client-server(C/S) and peer-to-peer (P2P) connectivity, as well as agents for identity authentications and secure communications. The framework has been simulated and verified with results showing promise."
10.5555/3437539.3437619,Dadu-CD: fast and efficient processing-in-memory accelerator for collision detection,"Collision detection is a fundamental task in motion planning of robotics. Typically, the performance of collision detection is the bottleneck of an entire motion planning, and so does the energy consumption. Several hardware accelerators have been proposed for collision detection, which achieves higher performance and energy efficiency than general-purpose CPUs and GPUs. However, existing accelerators are still facing the limited memory bandwidth bottleneck, due to the large data volume required by the parallel processing cores and the limited DRAM bandwidth. In this work, we propose a novel collision detection accelerator by employing the processing-in-memory technique. We elaborate the in-memory processing architecture to fully utilize the internal bandwidth of DRAM banks. To make the algorithm and hardware suitable for in-memory processing to be highly efficient, a set of innovative software and hardware techniques are also proposed. Compared with a state-of-the-art ASIC-based collision detection accelerator, both performance and energy efficiency of our accelerator are significantly improved."

10.5555/3463952.3463967,Reason Explanation for Encouraging Behaviour Change Intention,"The demand for intelligent virtual advisors in our rapidly advancing world is rising and, consequently, the need for understanding the reasoning process to answer why a particular piece of advice is provided to the user is directly increasing. Personalized explanation is regarded as a reliable way to improve the user's understanding and trust in the virtual advisor. So far, cognitive explainable agents utilize reason explanation by referring to their own mental state (beliefs and goals) to explain their own behaviour. However, when the explainable agent plays the role of a virtual advisor and recommends a behaviour for the human to perform, it is best to refer to the user's mental state, rather than the agent's mental state, to form a reason explanation. In this paper, we are developing an explainable virtual advisor (XVA) that communicates with the user to elicit the user's beliefs and goals and then tailors its advice and explains it according to the user's mental state. We tested the proposed XVA with university students where the XVA provides tips to reduce the students' study stress. We measured the impact of receiving three different patterns of tailored explanations (belief-based, goal-based, and belief&amp;goal-based explanation) in terms of the students' intentions to change their behaviours. The results showed that the intention to change is not only related to the explanation pattern but also to the user context, the relationship built with the agent, the type of behaviour recommended and the user's current intention to do the behaviour."
10.5555/3463952.3464007,Explaining BDI Agent Behaviour through Dialogue,"BDI agents act in response to external inputs and their internal plan library. Understanding the root cause of BDI agent action is often difficult, and in this paper we present a dialogue based approach for explaining the behaviour of a BDI agent. We consider two dialogue participants who may have different views regarding the beliefs, plans and external events which drove agent action (encoded via traces). These participants make utterances which incrementally reveal their traces to each other, allowing them to identify divergences in the traces, or to conclude that their traces agree. In practice, we envision a human taking on the role of a dialogue participant, with the BDI agent itself acting as the other participant. The dialogue then facilitates explanation, understanding and debugging of BDI agent behaviour. After presenting our formalism and its properties, we describe our implementation of the system and provide an example of its use in a simple scenario."
10.5555/3463952.3464034,Grid-to-Graph: Flexible Spatial Relational Inductive Biases for Reinforcement Learning,"Although reinforcement learning has been successfully applied in many domains in recent years, we still lack agents that can systematically generalize. While relational inductive biases that fit a task can improve generalization of RL agents, these biases are commonly hard-coded directly in the agent's neural architecture. In this work, we show that we can incorporate relational inductive biases, encoded in the form of relational graphs, into agents. Based on this insight, we propose Grid-to-Graph (GTG), a mapping from grid structures to relational graphs that carry useful spatial relational inductive biases when processed through a Relational Graph Convolution Network (R-GCN). We show that, with GTG, R-GCNs generalize better both in terms of in-distribution and out-of-distribution compared to baselines based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Neural Logic Machines on challenging procedurally generated environments and MinAtar. Furthermore, we show that GTG produces agents that can jointly reason over observations and environment dynamics encoded in knowledge bases."
10.5555/3463952.3464044,Deep Implicit Coordination Graphs for Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning,"Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordination to efficiently solve certain tasks. Fully centralized control is often infeasible in such domains due to the size of joint action spaces. Coordination graph based formalization allows reasoning about the joint action based on the structure of interactions. However,they often require domain expertise in their design. This paper introduces the deep implicit coordination graph (DICG) architecture for such scenarios. DICG consists of a module for inferring the dynamic coordination graph structure which is then used by a graph neural network based module to learn to implicitly reason about the joint actions or values. DICG allows learning the tradeoff between full centralization and decentralization via standard actor-critic methods to significantly improve coordination for domains with large number of agents. We apply DICG to both centralized-training-centralized-execution and centralized-training-decentralized-execution regimes. We demonstrate that DICG solves the relative over generalization pathology in predatory-prey tasks as well as outperforms various MARL baselines on the challenging StarCraft II Multi-agent Challenge (SMAC) and traffic junction environments."
10.5555/3463952.3464093,Active Perception within BDI Agents Reasoning Cycle,"In multi-agent systems the main process responsible for obtaining information about the environment is perception, generally this process is performed passively regardless the agent's intentional state. However, especially when inserted in the real world, a frequent problem is that agents have partial perception of the environment, failing to perceive some relevant information. To circumvent this problem, a solution is to actively take actions to perceive what is of interest to the agent, for example, in a computer vision system, the camera can be repositioned to have a better view of an object. This work aims to develop an active perception model integrated with the reasoning cycle of BDI agents. Experiments are performed using BDI agents with ROS to command unmanned aerial vehicles to analyze the benefits and impacts of using cognitive agents with active perception to program robot intelligence."
10.5555/3463952.3464115,Intention Progression using Quantitative Summary Information,"A key problem for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents is intention progression, i.e., which plans should be selected and how the execution of these plans should be interleaved so as to achieve the agent's goals. Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has been shown to be a promising approach to the intention progression problem, out-performing other approaches in the literature. However, MCTS relies on runtime simulation of possible interleavings of the plans in each intention, which may be computationally costly. In this paper, we introduce the notion of quantitative summary information which can be used to estimate the likelihood of conflicts between an agent's intentions. We show how offline simulation can be used to precompute quantitative summary information prior to execution of the agent's program, and how the precomputed summary information can be used at runtime to guide the expansion of the MCTS search tree and avoid unnecessary runtime simulation. We compare the performance of our approach with standard MCTS in a range of scenarios of increasing difficulty. The results suggest our approach can significantly improve the efficiency of MCTS in terms of the number of runtime simulations performed."
10.5555/3466184.3466303,Unified DEVS-based platform for modeling and simulation of hybrid control systems,"Recent robotic research has led to different architectural approaches that support enactment of automatically synthesized discrete event controllers from user specifications over low-level continuous variable controllers. Simulation of these hybrid control approaches to robotics can be a useful validation tool for robot users and architecture designers, but presents the key challenge of working with discrete and continuous representations of the robot, its environment and its mission plans. In this work we address this challenge showcasing a unified DEVS-based hybrid simulation platform. We model and simulate the hybrid robotic software architecture of a fixed-wing UAV, including the full stack of controllers involved: discrete, hybrid and continuous. We validate the approach experimentally on a typical UAV mapping mission and show that with our unified approach we are able to achieve simulation speed-ups up to one order of magnitude above our previous Software In The Loop simulation setup."
10.5555/3522802.3522882,Systemic characteristics to support hybrid simulation modeling,"Hybrid simulation (HS) is a modeling approach based on combining System Dynamics, Discrete Event Simulation, and/or Agent Based Simulation into a single model. There have been many benefits identified for utilization HS for planning and decision-making across many sectors. However, the lead time and skills requirements for developing HS models is usually greater than single methodology models. This position paper proposes that in order to improve and speed up the development of HS models, the decision to hybridize should be taken at the earliest possible point, i.e. when investigating the system and defining the problem. To this end, five system based characteristics have been proposed as decision points that help modelers to make such decisions. The paper concludes by suggesting a number of research avenues to follow for further improvements, whilst highlighting further challenges related to the availability of skills and tools for developing HS models."
10.5555/3523760.3523782,"Why do We Follow Robots? An Experimental Investigation of Conformity with Robot, Human, and Hybrid Majorities","Individuals tend to conform to a majority for reasons of peer pressure (normative conformity) and insecurity (informational conformity). It is important to investigate the reasons for social phenomena such as conformity in order to better understand processes in hybrid teams (i.e., teams which consist of humans and robots). Research has yielded conflicting results on conformity with robot and hybrid majorities, and the reasons for conformity remain unclear. We conducted a within-subject online experiment (n = 103) to compare the reasons for conformity under three conditions: human, robot, and hybrid majorities. Results indicate that subjects conformed most often with hybrid majorities, while they conformed least often with robot majorities. Normative conformity influenced conformity with human majorities, but informational conformity did not. Informational conformity influenced conformity with robot majorities, but normative conformity did not. Both types of conformity affected conformity with hybrid majorities. Our results provide a possible explanation for the heterogeneous findings on conformity in HRI"
10.5555/3523760.3523794,Mind the Machines: Applying Implicit Measures of Mind Perception in Social Robotics,"Beyond conscious beliefs and goals, automatic cognitive processes shape our social encounters, and interactions with complex machines like social robots are no exception. With this in mind, it is surprising that research in human-robot interaction (HRI) almost exclusively uses explicit measures, such as subjective ratings and questionnaires, to assess human attitudes towards robots - seemingly ignoring the importance of implicit measures. This is particularly true for research focusing on the question whether or not humans are willing to attribute complex mental states (i.e.,mind perception ), such asagency (i.e., the capacity to plan and act) andexperience (i.e., the capacity to sense and feel), to robotic agents. In the current study, we (i) created the mind perception implicit association test (MP-IAT) to examine subconscious attributions of mental capacities to agents of different degrees of human-likeness (here: human vs. humanoid robot), and (ii) compared the outcomes of the MP-IAT to explicit mind perception ratings of the same agents. Results indicate that (i) already at the subconscious level, robots are associated with lower levels of agency and experience compared to humans, and that (ii) implicit and explicit measures of mind perception are not significantly correlated. This suggests that mind perception (i) has an implicit component that can be measured using implicit tests like the IAT and (ii) might be difficult to modulate via design or experimental procedures due to its fast-acting, automatic nature."
10.5555/3535850.3535884,Optimizing Multi-Agent Coordination via Hierarchical Graph Probabilistic Recursive Reasoning,"Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordination by some means of interaction between agents to efficiently solve tasks. Interaction graphs allow reasoning about joint actions based on the local structure of interactions, but they disregard the potential impact of an agent's action on its neighbors' behaviors, which could rapidly alter in dynamic settings. In this paper, we thus present a novel perspective on opponent modeling in domains with only local interactions using (level-1) Graph Probabilistic Recursive Reasoning (GrPR2). Unlike previous work on recursive reasoning, each agent iteratively best-responds to other agents' policies over all possible local interactions. Agents' policies are approximated via a variational Bayes scheme for capturing their uncertainties, and we prove that an induced variant of Q-learning converges under self-play when there exists only one Nash equilibrium. In cooperative settings, we further devise a variational lower bound on the likelihood of each agent's optimality. Opposed to other models, optimizing the resulting objective prevents each agent from attaining an unrealistic modelling of others, and yields an exact tabular Q-iteration method that holds convergence guarantees. Then, we deepen the recursion to level-k via Cognitive Hierarchy GrPR2 (GrPR2-CH), which lets each level-k player best-respond to a mixture of strictly lower levels in the hierarchy. We prove that: (1) level-3 reasoning is the optimal hierarchical level, maximizing each agent's expected return; and (2) the weak spot of the classical CH models is that 0-level is uniformly distributed, as it may introduce policy bias. Finally, we propose a practical actor-critic scheme, and illustrate that GrPR2-CH outperforms strong MARL baselines in the particle environment."
10.5555/3535850.3535914,Intention-Aware Navigation in Crowds with Extended-Space POMDP Planning,"This paper presents a hybrid online Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) planning system that addresses the problem of autonomous navigation in the presence of multi-modal uncertainty introduced by other agents in the environment. As a particular example, we consider the problem of autonomous navigation in dense crowds of pedestrians and among obstacles. Popular approaches to this problem first generate a path using a complete planner (e.g., Hybrid A*) with ad-hoc assumptions about uncertainty, then use online tree-based POMDP solvers to reason about uncertainty with control over a limited aspect of the problem (i.e. speed along the path). We present a more capable and responsive real-time approach enabling the POMDP planner to control more degrees of freedom (e.g., both speed AND heading) to achieve more flexible and efficient solutions. This modification greatly extends the region of the state space that the POMDP planner must reason over, significantly increasing the importance of finding effective roll-out policies within the limited computational budget that real time control affords. Our key insight is to use multi-query motion planning techniques (e.g., Probabilistic Roadmaps or Fast Marching Method) as priors for rapidly generating efficient roll-out policies for every state that the POMDP planning tree might reach during its limited horizon search. Our proposed approach generates trajectories that are safe and significantly more efficient than the previous approach, even in densely crowded dynamic environments with long planning horizons."
10.5555/3535850.3535953,Preference-Based Goal Refinement in BDI Agents,"Computational agents based on the BDI framework typically rely on abstract plans and plan refinement to reach a degree of autonomy in dynamic environments: agents are provided with the ability to selecthow-to achieve their goals by choosing from a set of options. In this work we focus on a related, yet under-studied feature:abstract goals. These constructs refer to the ability of agents to adopt goals that are not fully grounded at the moment of invocation, refining them only when and where needed: the ability to selectwhat-to (concretely) achieve at run-time. We present a preference-based approach to goal refinement, defining preferences based on extendedCeteris Paribus Networks (CP-Nets) for an AgentSpeak(L)-like agent programming language, and mapping the established CP-Nets logic and algorithms to guide the goal refinement step. As a technical contribution, we present an implementation of this method that solely uses a Prolog-like inference engine of the agent's belief-base to reason about preferences, thus minimally affecting the decision-making mechanisms hard-coded in the agent framework."
10.5555/3535850.3535964,BOID*: Autonomous Goal Deliberation through Abduction,"The original BOID [5] is a cognitive architecture that unifies Belief, Obligation, Intention and Desire rules to calculate which actions should an agent undertake next. In the current paper, we adapt the original BOID with an aim to model autonomous agency. The new BOID* architecture is able to capture anticipation that we believe to be one of the hallmarks of autonomous agency. We focus on developing algorithms for anticipatory reasoning through a new BOID* goal deliberation component. The key method that BOID* introduces is abductive reasoning as a way to represent motivational attitudes, such as desires and obligations. As a result of deliberation via abduction, BOID* specifies intention revision procedures that connect motivational and informational attitudes. The BOID* is a part of the project to build autonomous AI models that make explicit the reasoning behind adopting future goals, prioritizing selected goals and forming intentions."
10.5555/3535850.3535982,Using Deep Learning to Bootstrap Abstractions for Hierarchical Robot Planning,"This paper addresses the problem of learning abstractions that boost robot planning performance while providing strong guarantees of reliability. Although state-of-the-art hierarchical robot planning algorithms allow robots to efficiently compute long-horizon motion plans for achieving user desired tasks, these methods typically rely upon environment-dependent state and action abstractions that need to be hand-designed by experts.We present a new approach for bootstrapping the entire hierarchical planning process. This allows us to compute abstract states and actions for new environments automatically using the critical regions predicted by a deep neural network with an auto-generated robot-specific architecture. We show that the learned abstractions can be used with a novel multi-source bi-directional hierarchical robot planning algorithm that is sound and probabilistically complete. An extensive empirical evaluation on twenty different settings using holonomic and non-holonomic robots shows that (a) our learned abstractions provide the information necessary for efficient multi-source hierarchical planning; and that (b) this approach of learning, abstractions, and planning outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by nearly a factor of ten in terms of planning time on test environments not seen during training."
10.5555/3535850.3535992,Socially Supervised Representation Learning: The Role of Subjectivity in Learning Efficient Representations,"Despite its rise as a prominent solution to the data inefficiency of today's machine learning models, self-supervised learning has yet to be studied from a purely multi-agent perspective. In this work, we propose that aligning internal subjective representations, which naturally arise in a multi-agent setup where agents receive partial observations of the same underlying environmental state, can lead to more data-efficient representations. We propose that multi-agent environments, where agents do not have access to the observations of others but can communicate within a limited range, guarantees a common context that can be leveraged in individual representation learning. The reason is that subjective observations necessarily refer to the same subset of the underlying environmental states and that communication about these states can freely offer a supervised signal. To highlight the importance of communication, we refer to our setting associally supervised representation learning. We present a minimal architecture comprised of a population of autoencoders, where we define loss functions, capturing different aspects of effective communication, and examine their effect on the learned representations. We show that our proposed architecture allows the emergence of aligned representations. The subjectivity introduced by presenting agents with distinct perspectives of the environment state contributes to learning abstract representations that outperform those learned by a single autoencoder and a population of autoencoders, presented with identical perspectives of the environment state. Altogether, our results demonstrate how communication from subjective perspectives can lead to the acquisition of more abstract representations in multi-agent systems, opening promising perspectives for future research at the intersection of representation learning and emergent communication."
10.5555/3535850.3535998,Epistemic Reasoning in Jason,"This paper presents an extension to the Jason BDI language to allow qualitative reasoning under uncertainty. We demonstrate the need for such an extension using a challenge from the 2019 Multi-Agent Programming Contest (MAPC), namely localization for navigation. Given the ability to qualitatively reason about what the agent knows and what it considers possible (or impossible), these challenges become easier to express, reason about, and act upon in a Jason program.Through the use of epistemic logic and the epistemic reasoner in Hintikka's World, our extension allows agents to express epistemic queries; specifically, utilizing the class of single-agent S5 epistemic models to model-check queries about the agent's uncertainty. This paper also provides an evaluation of the overall performance and scalability of the extension's implementation to show how it impacts the agent's reasoning time; from the evaluation results, we use the official 2019 MAPC time constraints to examine the performance tradeoffs of using the presented extension to model and reason about uncertainty."
10.5555/3545946.3598760,Feedback-Guided Intention Scheduling for BDI Agents,"Intelligent agents, like those based on the popular BDI agent paradigm, typically pursue multiple goals in parallel. An intention scheduler is required to reason about the possible interactions between the agent's intentions to maximize some utility. An important consideration when scheduling intentions is the user's preferences over the goals and the ways in which the goals are achieved. These preferences are generally unknown in advance, time-consuming to elicit, hard to model, and difficult to incorporate into an intention scheduler. In this paper, we present a Monte Carlo Tree Search based intention scheduler (pref-MCTS) that is able to learn the user's preferences over intention schedules via low-burden comparative-type queries. It incorporates the learned preferences in guiding the search, leading to execution policies that are optimized towards the user's preferences and expectations. We evaluate our approach using an artificial oracle that shows that pref-MCTS improves over state-of-the-art baselines, even when provided with a limited number of preference queries and noisy labels. We also conducted a user study and showed that pref-MCTS is able to learn user preferences and generate schedules that are preferred by the users in real-time."
10.5555/3545946.3598826,Intelligent Onboard Routing in Stochastic Dynamic Environments using Transformers,"Autonomous marine agents find extensive applications in environmental data collection, naval security, and exploration of harsh ocean regions. As intelligent agents, they must perform onboard routing, collect data about their surroundings and update their route to minimize mission travel time, energy, or data collection. While Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are often used for path planning, they are computationally expensive for onboard routing as they need in-mission re-planning. In the present paper, we develop a novel, deep learning method based on the decision transformers for optimal path planning and onboard routing of autonomous marine agents. The transformer architectures convert the RL-based optimal path planning problem into a supervised learning problem via sequence modeling. Before the mission, during the offline planning phase, the environment is first modeled as a stochastic dynamic ocean flow with dynamically orthogonal flow equations. A training dataset for the transformer model is created by solving the stochastic dynamically orthogonal Hamilton-Jacobi level set partial differential equations or a dynamic programming solution for MDPs. These paths are then processed to obtain sequences of states, actions and returns for our transformer models, where the agent's state is typically its spatio-temporal coordinate and other collectible data. We propose and analyze multiple state modeling choices against the agent's state estimation capabilities and scenarios with multiple target locations. We demonstrate that (i) a trained agent learns to infer the surrounding flow and perform optimal onboard routing when the agent's state estimation is accurate,(ii) specifying the target locations (in case of multiple targets) as a part of the state enables a trained agent to route itself to the correct destination, and (iii) a trained agent is robust to limited noise in state transitions and is capable of reaching target locations in completely new flow scenarios. We extensively showcase end-to-end planning and onboard routing in various canonical and idealized ocean flow scenarios. We analyze the predictions of the transformer models and explain the inner mechanics of learning through a novel visualization of self-attention of actions and states on the trajectories."
10.5555/3545946.3598838,Value Inference in Sociotechnical Systems,"As artificial agents become increasingly embedded in our society, we must ensure that their behavior aligns with human values. Value alignment entails value inference, the process of identifying values and reasoning about how humans prioritize values. We introduce a holistic framework that connects the technical (AI) components necessary for value inference. Subsequently, we discuss how hybrid intelligence-the synergy of human and artificial intelligence---is instrumental to the success of value inference. Finally, we illustrate how value inference both poses significant challenges and provides novel opportunities for multiagent systems research."
10.5555/3546258.3546359,LocalGAN: modeling local distributions for adversarial response generation,"This paper presents a new methodology for modeling the local semantic distribution of responses to a given query in the human-conversation corpus, and on this basis, explores a specified adversarial learning mechanism for training Neural Response Generation (NRG) models to build conversational agents. Our investigation begins with the thorough discussions upon the objective function of general Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) architectures, and the training instability problem is proved to be highly relative with the special local distributions of conversational corpora. Consequently, an energy function is employed to estimate the status of a local area restricted by the query and its responses in the semantic space, and the mathematical approximation of this energy-based distribution is finally found. Building on this foundation, a local distribution oriented objective is proposed and combined with the original objective, working as a hybrid loss for the adversarial training of response generation models, named as LocalGAN. Our experimental results demonstrate that the reasonable local distribution modeling of the query-response corpus is of great importance to adversarial NRG, and our proposed LocalGAN is promising for improving both the training stability and the quality of generated results."
10.5555/3581644.3581718,Real Time Local Re-Routing to Limit Queuing Delay Exploiting SRv6 and Extensible In-Band Processing,"In this paper we introduce QLR, a per-router control agent that aims at reducing the occupancy of the local buffers by performing re-routing operations. The Segment Routing architecture is exploited to manage the uncoordinated selection of rerouting performed by different nodes, thus avoiding the creation of routing loops, while the Extensible In-band Processing is used to allow the network nodes to have a detailed and updated view of the wide network status. Data and control plane programmability are considered to define a prototype implementation of QLR that allows for the execution of a preliminary performance evaluation and proof-of-concept. From the conducted experiments has emerged that QLR can effectively reduce the maximum queue occupancy and end-to-end delay up to 43\% and 63\%, respectively."
10.5555/3635637.3662854,Willy Wonka Mechanisms,"Bounded rationality in mechanism design aims to ensure incentive-compatibility for agents who are cognitively limited. These agents lack the contingent reasoning skills that traditional mechanism design assumes, and depending on how these cognitive limitations are modelled this alters the class of incentive-compatible mechanisms. In this work we design mechanisms without any ''obvious'' manipulations for several auction settings that aim to either maximise revenue or minimise the compensation paid to the agents. A mechanism without obvious manipulations is said to be not obviously manipulable (NOM), and assumes agents act truthfully as long as the maximum and minimum utilities from doing so are no worse than the maximum and minimum utilities from lying, with the extremes taken over all possible actions of the other agents. We exploit the definition of NOM by introducing the concept of golden tickets and wooden spoons, which designate bid profiles ensuring the mechanism's incentive-compatibility for each agent. We then characterise these ''Willy Wonka'' mechanisms, and by carefully choosing the golden tickets and wooden spoons we use this to design revenue-maximising auctions and frugal procurement auctions."
10.5555/3635637.3662884,Fast and Slow Goal Recognition,"Goal recognition is a crucial aspect of understanding the intentions and objectives of agents by observing some of their actions. The most prominent approaches to goal recognition can be divided into two main categories: (1) trustworthy systems, which exploit automated reasoning for computing plans compatible with the observed actions, and (2) swifter systems, which try to quickly infer goals, often overlooking complex cognitive processes, and have no formal guarantees of their results. This paper introduces a novel approach inspired by the dual process theory, which integrates these two techniques. A dual-process model is proposed, leveraging fast, experience-based recognition for immediate goal identification, and slow, deliberate analysis for deeper understanding. Machine learning techniques and classical planning techniques are employed to obtain this dual-process system. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, reducing the amount of resources required to compute a solution (e.g., time to find a goal), while at the same time enhancing accuracy and robustness, especially in more complex scenarios."
10.5555/3635637.3662921,NovelGym: A Flexible Ecosystem for Hybrid Planning and Learning Agents Designed for Open Worlds,"As AI agents leave the lab and venture into the real world as autonomous vehicles, delivery robots, and cooking robots, it is increasingly necessary to design and comprehensively evaluate algorithms that tackle the ""open-world''. To this end, we introduce NovelGym, a flexible and adaptable ecosystem designed to simulate gridworld environments, serving as a robust platform for benchmarking reinforcement learning (RL) and hybrid planning and learning agents in open-world contexts. The modular architecture of NovelGym facilitates rapid creation and modification of task environments, including multi-agent scenarios, with multiple environment transformations, thus providing a dynamic testbed for researchers to develop open-world AI agents."
10.5555/3635637.3662942,BDI Agents in Natural Language Environments,"Developing autonomous agents to deal with real-world problems is challenging, especially when developers are not necessarily specialists in artificial intelligence. This poses two key challenges regarding the interface of the programming with the developer, and the efficiency of the resulting agents. In this paper we tackle both challenges in an efficient agent architecture that leverages recent developments in natural language processing, and the intuitive folk psychology abstraction of the beliefs, desires, intentions (BDI) architecture. The resulting architecture uses existing reinforcement learning techniques to bootstrap the agent's reasoning capabilities while allowing a developer to instruct the agent more directly using natural language as its programming interface. We empirically show the efficiency gains of natural language plans over a pure machine learning approach in the ScienceWorld environment."
10.5555/3635637.3662981,2D-Ptr: 2D Array Pointer Network for Solving the Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem,"The heterogeneous capacitated vehicle routing problem (HCVRP) aims to optimize the routes of heterogeneous vehicles with capacity constraints to serve a set of customers with demands. Existing learning-based methods for solving HCVRP have the problem of weak generalization ability, which means that well-trained model cannot adapt well to new scenarios with different vehicle or customer numbers. To address this issue, by modeling the simultaneous decision-making of multiple agents as a sequence of consecutive actions in real time, we propose a pointer network extension model, which includes a static encoder and a dynamic encoder to map the current situation to node embeddings and vehicle embeddings, respectively. For each element in the consecutive actions sequence, the decoder of our model uses the probability distribution obtained from node embeddings and vehicle embeddings as a 2D array pointer to select a tuple from the combinations of vehicles and nodes (customers and depot). We call this architecture a 2D Array Pointer network (2D-Ptr). Instead of planning paths based on the priority order of vehicles, 2D-Ptr plans paths based on the priority order of actions. In addition, 2D-Ptr consists of a series of carefully designed attention modules, entitling the model to be generalizable in the scenarios where additional vehicles (or customers) are introduced or existing vehicles (or customers) are removed. We empirically test 2D-Ptr and show its capability for producing near-optimal solutions through cooperative actions. 2D-Ptr delivers competitive performance against the state-of-the-art baselines, and can solve arbitrary instances of the HCVRP without requiring re-training."
10.5555/3635637.3663023,Design Patterns for Explainable Agents (XAg),"The ability to explain the behaviour of the AI systems is a key aspect of building trust, especially for autonomous agent systems - how does one trust an agent whose behaviour can not be explained? In this work, we advocate the use of design patterns for developing explainable-by-design agents (XAg), to ensure explainability is an integral feature of agent systems rather than an ""add-on"" feature. We present TriQPAN (Trigger, Query, Process, Action and Notify), a design pattern for XAg. TriQPAN can be used to explain behaviours of any agent architecture and we show how this can be done to explain decisions such as why the agent chose to pursue a particular goal, why or why didn't the agent choose a particular plan to achieve a goal, and so on. We term these queries as direct queries. Our framework also supports temporal correlation queries such as asking a search and rescue drone, ""which locations did you visit and why?"". We implemented TriQPAN in the SARL agent language, built-in to the goal reasoning engine, affording developers XAg with minimal overhead. The implementation will be made available for public use. We describe that implementation and apply it to two case studies illustrating the explanations produced, in practice."
10.5555/3635637.3663033,Modeling Cognitive Biases in Decision-theoretic Planning for Active Cyber Deception,"This paper presents an approach to modeling and exploiting cognitive biases of cyber attackers in planning for active deception. Sophisticated cyber attacks are primarily orchestrated by human actors. Hence, we focus on the human aspect of the attacker's decision-making process. Humans deviate from rational decision-making due to various cognitive biases. Here, we focus on fundamental attribution error (FAE) and confirmation bias and their role in cyber deception because these biases contribute to humans being deceived. We use the decision-theoretic planning framework of finitely-nested factored I-POMDP (I-POMDPχ), which allows us to explicitly model FAE in multi-agent settings and build cognitive models of the attackers. We show how these biases impact their beliefs as they act and obtain more information about the environment and the adversary. The tractability of the I-POMDPχ also allows for modeling agents at a higher strategy level where the optimal policy relies on induction and exploitation of these biases. Hence, we also present an I-POMDPχ-based rational defender agent that can model the attacker's beliefs under the influence of FAE and confirmation bias from a higher strategic level, and exploit them. Our experiments in simulated interactions show that the I-POMDPχ-based defender agent can induce FAE in an attacker to distort the attacker's beliefs. Consequently, the defender agent can exploit the attacker's cognitive biases to extend the duration of the attack to facilitate the attacker's intent recognition in a controlled environment. Our work provides a general decision-theoretic formulation of FAE and confirmation bias, and demonstrates its role in planning for agent-based active cyber deception."
10.5555/3635637.3663048,Enabling BDI Agents to Reason on a Dynamic Action Repertoire in Hypermedia Environments,"Autonomy requires adaptability and persistence in pursuing long-term objectives within evolving contexts. While BDI agents can cope with dynamic and uncertain environments, their adaptability is typically constrained by static action repertoires, known a priori by designers. Through Semantic Web and Web of Things technologies, machine-readable action descriptions can be discovered in hypermedia environments, and updated dynamically to mirror the evolving landscape of actions offered by real-world environments. This paper proposes the integration of action-oriented BDI reasoning with signifiers that reveal information about action possibilities that may appear, disappear, or be modified in a hypermedia environment at any time. We extend the means-end reasoning of BDI agents with a mechanism for resolving signifiers discovered at run time into actions, which enables agents to adjust their decision-making based on action possibilities advertised in the environment. We evaluate our approach through experiments, where Jason agents discover signifiers expressed with available Web ontologies. The results demonstrate that our signifier resolution mechanism enhances action reasoning at run time towards effective goal achievement in dynamic and unknown environments."
10.5555/3635637.3663063,Attention-based Priority Learning for Limited Time Multi-Agent Path Finding,"Solving large-scale Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) within a limited time remains an open challenge, despite its importance for many robotic applications. Recent learning-based methods scale better than conventional ones, but remain suboptimal and often exhibit low success rates within a limited time on large-scale instances. These limitations often stem from their black-box nature. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach that incorporates prioritized planning with learning-based methods to explicitly address these challenges. We formulate prioritized planning as a Markov Decision Process and introduce a reinforcement learning-based prioritized planning paradigm. In doing so, we develop a novel Synthetic Score-based Attention Network (S2AN) to learn conflict/blocking relationships among agents, and deliver blocking-free priorities. By integrating priority mechanisms and leveraging a new attention-based neural network for enhanced multi-agent cooperative strategies, our method enhances solution completeness while trading off scalability and maintains linear time complexity, thus offering a robust avenue for large-scale MAPF tasks. Comparisons demonstrate its superiority over current learning-based methods in terms of solution quality, completeness, and reachability within limited time constraints, especially in large-scale scenarios. Moreover, an extensive set of numerical results reveals superior completeness compared to restricted-time Priority-Based Search (PBS) and Priority Inheritance with Backtracking (PIBT) in medium to large-scale obstacle-dense scenarios."
10.5555/3635637.3663074,Pragmatic Instruction Following and Goal Assistance via Cooperative Language-Guided Inverse Planning,"People often give instructions whose meaning is ambiguous without further context, expecting that their actions or goals will disambiguate their intentions. How can we build assistive agents that follow such instructions in a flexible, context-sensitive manner? This paper introduces cooperative language-guided inverse plan search (CLIPS), a Bayesian agent architecture for pragmatic instruction following and goal assistance. Our agent assists a human by modeling them as a cooperative planner who communicates joint plans to the assistant, then performs multimodal Bayesian inference over the human's goal from actions and language, using large language models (LLMs) to evaluate the likelihood of an instruction given a hypothesized plan. Given this posterior, our assistant acts to minimize expected goal achievement cost, enabling it to pragmatically follow ambiguous instructions and provide effective assistance even when uncertain about the goal. We evaluate these capabilities in two cooperative planning domains (Doors, Keys \&amp; Gems and VirtualHome), finding that CLIPS significantly outperforms GPT-4V, LLM-based literal instruction following and unimodal inverse planning in both accuracy and helpfulness, while closely matching the inferences and assistive judgments provided by human raters."
10.5555/3635637.3663257,Empowering BDI Agents with Generalised Decision-Making,"While research on software agents has long focused on explicit agent communication, there is comparatively less effort on implicit communication between agents via recognising each other's intentions and desires for understanding their decision-making reasoning process. Since most human communication is not explicit, we aim to outline a research agenda to help endow autonomous agents with analogous coordination capabilities. In this paper, we formalise a framework that empowers the decision-making process of BDI agents in adversarial and cooperative environments by casting them as generalised planners using Theory of Mind. Our formalisation uses the fundamental philosophical properties of the BDI model and its reasoning process to outline a broad research agenda in agents' research."
10.5555/3643142.3643315,Investigating Production Yield Effect on Inventory Control through a Hybrid Simulation Approach,"Production Planning and Control (PPC) plays a key role in stabilizing and improving manufacturing processes under external and internal uncertainties by providing transparency in the whole system. This study focuses on PPC with internal uncertainties such as losses of work-in-process products during a contact lens manufacturing process. Although such losses are expected, the yield rates are uncertain and vary at different production stages. A hybrid agent-based simulation (ABS) and discrete-event simulation (DES) approach was utilized to resemble the underlying dynamics of the manufacturing system with uncertain yield rates. The results of the simulation experiments demonstrated that a simple average yield approach for production planning would cause potential backlogs and extra holding costs for the excess inventory. The proposed hybrid simulation could be used to support the decision-making process on a weekly basis to help a production planning team make a schedule that would improve efficiency and customer satisfaction."
10.5555/3648699.3649067,LapGym: an open source framework for reinforcement learning in robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery,"Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have increased the promise of introducing cognitive assistance and automation to robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALS). However, progress in algorithms and methods depends on the availability of standardized learning environments that represent skills relevant to RALS. We present LapGym, a framework for building RL environments for RALS that models the challenges posed by surgical tasks, and sofa_env, a diverse suite of 12 environments. Motivated by surgical training, these environments are organized into 4 tracks: Spatial Reasoning, Deformable Object Manipulation \& Grasping, Dissection, and Thread Manipulation. Each environment is highly parametrizable for increasing difficulty, resulting in a high performance ceiling for new algorithms. We use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to establish a baseline for model-free RL algorithms, investigating the effect of several environment parameters on task difficulty. Finally, we show that many environments and parameter configurations reect well-known, open problems in RL research, allowing researchers to continue exploring these fundamental problems in a surgical context. We aim to provide a challenging, standard environment suite for further development of RL for RALS, ultimately helping to realize the full potential of cognitive surgical robotics. LapGym is publicly accessible through GitHub (https://github.com/ScheiklP/lap_gym)."
10.5555/3709347.3743552,Feature Engineering for Agents: An Adaptive Cognitive Architecture for Interpretable ML Monitoring,"Monitoring Machine Learning (ML) models in production environments is crucial, yet traditional approaches often yield verbose, low-interpretability outputs that hinder effective decision-making. We propose a cognitive architecture for ML monitoring that applies feature engineering principles to agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly enhancing the interpretability of monitoring outputs. Central to our approach is a Decision Procedure module that simulates feature engineering through three key steps: Refactor, Break Down, and Compile. The Refactor step improves data representation to better capture feature semantics, allowing the LLM to focus on salient aspects of the monitoring data while reducing noise and irrelevant information. Break Down decomposes complex information for detailed analysis, and Compile integrates sub-insights into clear, interpretable outputs. This process leads to a more deterministic planning approach, reducing dependence on LLM-generated planning, which can sometimes be inconsistent and overly general. The combination of feature engineering-driven planning and selective LLM utilization results in a robust decision support system, capable of providing highly interpretable and actionable insights. Experiments using multiple LLMs demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, achieving significantly higher accuracy compared to various baselines across several domains."
10.5555/3709347.3743563,Human-Agent Coordination in Games under Incomplete Information via Multi-Step Intent,"Strategic coordination between autonomous agents and human partners under incomplete information can be modeled as turn-based cooperative games. We extend a turn-based game under incomplete information, the shared-control game, to allow players to take multiple actions per turn rather than a single action. The extension enables the use of multi-step intent, which we hypothesize will improve performance in long-horizon tasks. To synthesize cooperative policies for the agent in this extended game, we propose an approach featuring a memory module for a running probabilistic belief of the environment dynamics and an online planning algorithm called IntentMCTS. This algorithm strategically selects the next action by leveraging any communicated multi-step intent via reward augmentation while considering the current belief. Agent-to-agent simulations in the Gnomes at Night testbed demonstrate that IntentMCTS requires fewer steps and control switches than baseline methods. A human-agent user study corroborates these findings, showing an 18.52\% higher success rate compared to the heuristic baseline and a 5.56\% improvement over the single-step prior work. Participants also report lower cognitive load, frustration, and higher satisfaction with the IntentMCTS agent partner."
10.5555/3709347.3743564,Azorus: Commitments over Protocols for BDI Agents,"Commitments support flexible interactions between agents by capturing the meaning of their interactions. However, commitment-based reasoning is not adequately supported in agent programming models. We contribute Azorus, a programming model based on declarative specifications centered on commitments and aligned with information protocols. Azorus supports reasoning about goals and commitments and combines modeling of commitments and protocols, thereby uniting three leading declarative approaches to engineering decentralized multiagent systems. Specifically, we realize Azorus over three existing technology suites: (1) Jason, a popular BDI-based programming model; (2) Cupid, a formal language and query-based model for commitments; and (3) BSPL, a language and its associated tools for information protocols, including Jason programming. We implement Azorus and demonstrate how it enables capturing interesting patterns of business logic."
10.5555/3709347.3743782,Generalised BDI Planning,"Agent interpreters based on the Beliefs, Desires, and Intentions (BDI) model traditionally perform means-ends reasoning using plan libraries composed of reactive planning rules. However, the design of such rules often imposes a heavy knowledge engineering burden on a designer, and trades off flexibility for runtime efficiency. This use of planning rules originates from the limitations of planning technology at the time of the first BDI implementations. While these limitations have gradually been overcome by the integration of various types of planning into existing BDI theories, the corresponding interpreters remain fundamentally plan-library based. In this paper, we develop a novel BDI agent architecture driven by generalised planning as means-ends reasoning, in a radical departure from existing architectures. This architecture has two key properties. First, it more closely resembles the foundations of BDI logic and reasoning. Second, it offers substantial gains in efficiency in comparison with an architecture driven by classical planning."
10.5555/3709347.3743788,Personality-Driven Decision Making in LLM-Based Autonomous Agents,"The embedding of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents is a rapidly developing field which enables dynamic, configurable behaviours without the need for extensive domain-specific training. In our previous work, we introduced SANDMAN, a Deceptive Agent architecture leveraging the Five-Factor OCEAN personality model, demonstrating that personality induction significantly influences agent task planning. Building on these findings, this study presents a novel method for measuring and evaluating how induced personality traits affect task selection processes-specifically planning, scheduling, and decision-making-in LLM-based agents. Our results reveal distinct task-selection patterns aligned with induced OCEAN attributes, underscoring the feasibility of designing highly plausible Deceptive Agents for proactive cyber defense strategies."
10.5555/3709347.3743808,"Planning, Scheduling, and Execution on the Moon: The CADRE Technology Demonstration Mission","NASA's Cooperative Autonomous Distributed Robotic Exploration (CADRE) mission, slated for flight to the Moon's Reiner Gamma region in 2025/2026, is designed to demonstrate multi-agent autonomous exploration of the Lunar surface and sub-surface. A team of three robots and a base station will autonomously explore a region near the lander, collecting the data required for 3D reconstruction of the surface with no human input; and then autonomously perform distributed sensing with multi-static ground penetrating radars (GPR), driving in formation while performing coordinated radar soundings to create a map of the subsurface. At the core of CADRE's software architecture is a novel autonomous, distributed planning, scheduling, and execution (PS&amp;E) system. The system coordinates the robots' activities, planning and executing tasks that require multiple robots' participation while ensuring that each individual robot's thermal and power resources stay within prescribed bounds, and respecting ground-prescribed sleep-wake cycles. The system uses a centralized-planning, distributed-execution paradigm, and a leader election mechanism ensures robustness to failures of individual agents. In this paper, we describe the architecture of CADRE's PS&amp;E system; discuss its design rationale; and report on verification and validation (V&amp;V) testing of the system on CADRE's hardware in preparation for deployment on the Moon."
10.5555/3709347.3743817,Gricean Norms as a Basis for Effective Collaboration,"Effective human-AI collaboration hinges not only on the AI agent's ability to follow explicit instructions but also on its capacity to navigate ambiguity, incompleteness, invalidity, and irrelevance in communication. Gricean conversational and inference norms facilitate collaboration by aligning unclear instructions with cooperative principles. We propose a normative framework that integrates Gricean norms and cognitive frameworks---common ground, relevance theory, and theory of mind---into large language model (LLM) based agents. The normative framework adopts the Gricean maxims of quantity, quality, relation, and manner, along with inference, as Gricean norms to interpret unclear instructions, which are: ambiguous, incomplete, invalid, or irrelevant. Within this framework, we introduce Lamoids, GPT-4 powered agents designed to collaborate with humans. To assess the influence of Gricean norms in human-AI collaboration, we evaluate two versions of a Lamoid: one with norms and one without. In our experiments, a Lamoid collaborates with a human to achieve shared goals in a grid world (Doors, Keys, and Gems) by interpreting both clear and unclear natural language instructions. Our results reveal that the Lamoid with Gricean norms achieves higher task accuracy and generates clearer, more accurate, and contextually relevant responses than the Lamoid without norms. This improvement stems from the normative framework, which enhances the agent's pragmatic reasoning, fostering effective human-AI collaboration and enabling context-aware communication in LLM-based agents."
10.5555/3709347.3743841,Logic of Knowledge and Cognitive Ability,"Along with the convenience brought by the increasing usage of autonomous systems, unexpected accidents happened. These accidents emphasize the need for autonomous systems to possess the ability to recognize potential hazards, effectively communicate these hazards to human operators, and facilitate retrospective analyses. This ability, including recognition, prejudgment, post-analysis, and reasoning, falls within the realm of cognitive ability, which is important in improving the safety and outcomes in the decision-making process of such systems. In this paper, we present a foundational step toward addressing the safety challenges involving the cognitive ability of artificial agents. We study the interplay between knowledge and the cognitive ability of intelligent agents. The main technical result is a sound and complete bimodal logical system that describes the interplay between the knowledge and cognitive ability modalities."
10.5555/3709347.3744035,The Next Level of Long-Term Agent Autonomy -- Proactively Acquiring Knowledge and Abilities,"For an artificial agent operating long-term under real-world conditions it is not enough to be able to act on orders given by the human. Even being able to act proactively (anticipatory, self-initiated) does not suffice. The reason roots in the unrealistic assumption that the proactive agent from the start and always knows everything it needs to know and has all the abilities it requires. We argue that the agent has to be able to proactively learn new knowledge and abilities according to how the dynamic environment evolves. We identify challenges and directions towards proactive learning. Our focus is on formal methods which lend themselves to doing the necessary reasoning but also give suggestions how these might be integrated with machine learning. The ideas envisioned in this paper can advance (M)AS (Multi-Agent Systems) research and have the potential to enhance collaborations of hybrid human-AI systems."
10.5555/3709347.3744038,Grounding Agent Reasoning in Image Schemas: A Neurosymbolic Approach to Embodied Cognition,"Despite advances in embodied AI, agent reasoning systems still struggle to capture the fundamental conceptual structures that humans naturally use to understand and interact with their environment. To address this, we propose a novel framework that bridges embodied cognition theory and agent systems by leveraging a formal characterization of image schemas, which are defined as recurring patterns of sensorimotor experience that structure human cognition. By customizing LLMs to translate natural language descriptions into formal representations based on these sensorimotor patterns, we will be able to create a neurosymbolic system that grounds the agent's understanding in fundamental conceptual structures. We argue that such an approach enhances both efficiency and interpretability while enabling more intuitive human-agent interactions through shared embodied understanding."
10.5555/3709347.3744045,Responsible Autonomy for Hybrid Intelligence,"In hybrid intelligence (HI) systems, artificial intelligence (AI) agents and humans work together to solve complex tasks. In these interactions, each agent is expected to work autonomously and be responsible for their actions. By capturing consent as a regulation of actions in a normative environment (such as a HI system), an agent can determine an appropriate action within the normative environment, and reason on the moral and ethical requirements and effects of the action. Current consent representations do not allow agents to reason on normative actions, which limit agent autonomy. We are developing a representation of consent that captures the nuances of consent from human-human interaction, and expresses them computationally to allow the AI agent to responsibly practice autonomy in a HI system. In future work, the proposed representation will be evaluated against human intuitions about consent, and compared to current consent representations to ensure a robust and domain-agnostic formalisation. Further research includes developing a consent representation that can manage multi-party consent and shared resources, specifying accounts for consent violations to determine culpability, and exploring a developmental approach to norm representation and management for greater perceived agent responsibility and autonomy in a HI system."

10.5555/3712729.3712749,Incorporating the Com-B Model for Behavior Change into an Agent-Based Model of Smoking Behaviors: An Object-Oriented Design,"Modeling trajectories in cigarette smoking prevalence, initiation and quitting for populations and subgroups of populations is important for policy planning and evaluation. This paper proposes an agent-based model (ABM) design for simulating the smoking behaviors of a population using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation - Behavior (COM-B) model. Capability, Opportunity and Motivation are modeled as latent composite attributes which are composed of observable factors associated with smoking behaviors. Three forms of the COM-B model are proposed to explain the transitions between smoking behaviors: initiating regular smoking uptake, making a quit attempt and quitting successfully. The ABM design follows object-oriented principles and extends an existing generic software architecture for mechanism-based modeling. The potential of the model to assess the impact of smoking policies is illustrated and discussed."
10.5555/3712729.3712829,Planning a Material Replenishment through Autonomous Mobile Robot in an Assembly Plant Using a Hybrid Simulation Approach,"This paper focuses on planning the implementation of an autonomous mobile robot in an existing material replenishment system of an assembly plant using a hybrid simulation approach. In this research, we aim to identify proper strategies for the number of containers or payloads the robot should carry per shift under different scenarios using Agent-Based Modeling and Discrete Event Simulation. Our primary objective is to minimize the number of shifts a mobile robot should travel for replenishment while keeping idle time low across all stations and ensuring timely material replenishment. The results show that choosing which strategy to use for the implementation of the autonomous navigating robot depends on the maximum number of containers it can carry and the utilization of payload space. While this paper focuses on Tiger Motors Assembly line at Auburn University, its applications could be extended to similar assembly plants equipped with a similar material replenishment system."
10.5555/3716662.3716760,A Model- and Data-Agnostic Debiasing System for Achieving Equalized Odds,"As reliance on Machine Learning (ML) systems in real-world decision-making processes grows, ensuring these systems are free of bias against sensitive demographic groups is of increasing importance. Existing techniques for automatically debiasing ML models generally require access to either the models' internal architectures, the models' training datasets, or both. In this paper we outline the reasons why such requirements are disadvantageous, and present an alternative novel debiasing system that is both data- and model-agnostic. We implement this system as a Reinforcement Learning Agent and through extensive experiments show that we can debias a variety of target ML model architectures over three benchmark datasets. Our results show performance comparable to data- and/or model-gnostic state-of-the-art debiasers."
10.5555/3721488.3721623,Capabilities2 for ROS2: Advanced Skill-Based Control for Human-Robot Interaction,"In the early days of the Open Source Robotics Foundation, a lesser-known project aimed to design an ''app-able robot'', leading to the creation of the ''Capabilities'' package for the Robot Operating System. Over a decade later, formulating robot capabilities remains a significant technical hurdle in bringing robots from the lab into everyday life. This paper introduces Capabilities2, a successor to the original Capabilities package, now reimagined for ROS2. Capabilities2 enhances the original design by enabling advancements in skill-based control techniques and offering a more efficient, extensible framework for defining and utilising robot capabilities. We delve into its application in new real-world scenarios, with a particular focus on human-robot interactions and the deployment of collaborative mobile robots in human-centric environments. Capabilities2 addresses challenges in implementing intuitive, collaborative robots by introducing an abstracted database handler, an object-relational mapping for capability models, and a plugin architecture for capability execution. These features support dynamic capability representation, runtime adaptability, and integration with modern AI techniques for skill-based task planning. By providing a standardised yet flexible framework, Capabilities2 reduces the integration effort required to develop top-level controls for real-world scenarios, facilitating rapid development and deployment. Our contributions include the reimplementation of the Capabilities package in ROS2, enhancements to support contemporary robotic applications, and demonstrations of new use cases enabled by Capabilities2. We believe that Capabilities2 significantly advances the field of robotics by equipping developers with tools to create more capable, adaptable, and interactive robots.

10.5555/3721488.3721763,Demonstration of an Open-source ROS 2 Framework and Simulator for Situated Interactive Social Robot,"We introduce an open-source ROS 2 architecture for situated social robots, along with a simulator that allows mixed-reality development and interactions. The architecture is a hybrid symbolic/subsymbolic system that integrates explicit ontology semantics for perception, reasoning, and execution, with LLMs. It features multimodal social perception by leveraging the open source ROS4HRI framework; LLMs (both edge- and cloud-based) to facilitate natural language interaction between the user and system; KnowledgeCore, an open-source knowledge base, to reason about facts in the world; and an intent-based controller to supervise the execution of parallel/sequential tasks and skills. We demonstrate our system architecture with a social robot running the mixed-reality system."
10.58496/MJCSC/2025/026,Agentic AI-Enhanced Virtual Reality for Adaptive Immersive Learning Environments,"Immersive learning using Virtual Reality (VR) has gained prominence for delivering experiential, engaging education. However, most VR learning environments lack real-time adaptability, personalization, and cognitive responsiveness. This study presents an Agentic AI-enabled VR framework that autonomously adjusts pedagogical content, interaction style, and challenge level based on learner behavior, emotions, and performance feedback. The proposed system integrates a reinforcement learning-based agent with a virtual reality module to form an intelligent tutor capable of independent decision-making. A neuro-symbolic model processes multi-modal feedback (gesture, speech, gaze, performance) to determine context-aware pedagogical strategies. The system employs a self-evolving curriculum logic that adapts in real time. Experiments are conducted using Unity3D integrated with Python-based RL agents and simulated student models. Results demonstrate a 35.7% improvement in learner retention and a 42.1% reduction in cognitive overload compared to traditional static VR systems. The agent successfully personalized 92.3% of scenarios without human intervention. Emotional adaptivity and dynamic pacing showed increased engagement and reduced frustration metrics among diverse learners. Agentic VR represents a paradigm shift in intelligent education systems, enabling autonomous, emotionally-aware, and responsive learning environments. The proposed framework outperforms conventional VR platforms by offering real-time adaptive learning without pre-scripted logic. Integrating reinforcement learning, neuro-symbolic reasoning, and affective feedback into a single VR space results in a novel contribution to adaptive educational technology. The reported metrics were obtained from an administrator-controlled user study of 10 participants (aged 18-25 years), all of whom participated in three VR-based learning experiences as described in a controlled evaluative protocol. This study provides a foundation for future work on autonomous agents in educational met verses, special education, and lifelong learning systems. © 2025, Mesopotamian Academic Press.
