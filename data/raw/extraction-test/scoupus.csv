This study develops a novel predictive energy management architecture, which consists of the Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). Specifically, the speed predictor is built using xLSTM network and leverages the speed and position information of the preceding and following vehicles. In order to provide a reliable basis for energy management in degradation scenarios, an FCS degradation model is developed, which enables the dynamic mapping of output efficiency curves under varying state-of-health (SOH) conditions. Sequentially, a SAC-based agent is employed as the energy management strategy (EMS), which innovatively takes full account of the impact of the FCS SOH on energy allocation, achieving proactive degradation-aware energy allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that the developed xLSTM architecture achieves a 71 % improvement in speed prediction accuracy compared to Transformer-based models within the Next Generation Simulation validated scenario. Moreover, at SOH = 90 %, the newly designed EMS reduces operational costs by 8.7 % and 10.7 % compared to conventional methods under the New European Driving Cycle and Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure, while decreasing FCS degradation costs by 17 % and 51 %, respectively. The innovative approach not only elevates energy efficiency but also prolongs FCS operational longevity via intelligent SOH-aware, which establishes a new paradigm for lifecycle-optimized energy management in FCHEVs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Scopus"

Yet, designing a trajectory that considers realistic operational constraints could be complex and, consequently, computationally expensive. Traditional trajectory optimization methods often simplify the problem to manage computational costs, which leads to compromised accuracy. To overcome this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that can satisfy multidisciplinary constraints by leveraging accurately modeled flight dynamics, high-fidelity population data, and topological data. This is achieved by establishing a comprehensive, physically-consistent simulated environment for the learning algorithm, while keeping the computational cost low. Instead of directly designing the trajectory itself, we train an RL agent to control the aircraft, whose trajectory is then considered as optimal. We model the RL problem as a continuous Markov decision process and employ the soft actor-critic architecture. By changing the relative importance of fuel consumption and noise in the optimization objective, we can obtain different optimum trajectories that are well-suited to the specific region of interest. Not surprisingly, a trade-off between fuel consumption and noise impact is observed in our results. This developed framework provides a more accurate and sophisticated approach for departure trajectory optimization, whose results are beneficial for future airspace design and can support sustainable aviation efforts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Scopus"

This approach involves three critical elements: system modeling and control architecture, interoperable communication, and adaptive manufacturing control. However, current research often separates interoperable communication from adaptive manufacturing control as isolated areas of study. To address this gap, this paper introduces Knowledge Graph-enhanced Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method that integrates interoperable communication via Knowledge Graphs with adaptive manufacturing control through Reinforcement Learning. We hypothesize that implicit domain knowledge obtained from historical production job allocation records can guide each agent to learn more effective scheduling policies with accelerated learning rates. This is based on the premise that machine assignment preferences effectively could reduce the Reinforcement Learning search space. Specifically, we redesign machine agents with new observation, action, reward, and cooperation mechanisms considering the preference of machines, building upon our previous MARL base model. The scheduling policies are trained under extensive simulation experiments that consider manufacturing requirements. During the training process, our approach demonstrates improved training speed compared with individual Reinforcement Learning methods under the same training hyperparameters. The obtained scheduling policies generated by our Knowledge Graph-enhanced MARL also outperform both individual Reinforcement Learning methods and heuristic rules under dynamic manufacturing settings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Scopus"

In this work, we introduce a modular and interoperable architecture that combines digital twins with reinforcement learning for adaptive decision-making in complex environmental systems. We apply this approach to smart farming, where efficient resource use is critical to balance productivity with environmental impact. Our contributions are threefold: (a) the augmentation of agricultural models as digital twins—specifically the crop growth model WOFOST and the plant disease model A-scab—that assimilate field data to reflect current crop conditions; (b) the integration of reinforcement learning agents that generate recommendations for pesticide and fertilizer application—the first to demonstrate interoperable reinforcement learning-integrated digital twins in operational agriculture; and (c) the development of a FIWARE-based interoperability layer that integrates a diverse set of (edge) components. We demonstrate our approach in two pilot studies—apple scab management and nitrogen application in winter wheat—showcasing its potential for real-world application in diverse agricultural contexts and its transferability to other domains. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Scopus"

Classical computing lacks the speed and accuracy needed for effective stakeholder collaboration in COVID-19 healthcare solutions, such as patients, insurance agents, healthcare practitioners, pharmaceutical suppliers, etc. The research uses organizational information processing theory (OIPT) to examine how quantum computing which is applications of artificial intelligence (AI) could transform the healthcare business, creating a more sustainable and less burdened system. The study of quantum computing (QC) has the potential to bring about “quantum leaps,” which might have unforeseen consequences for healthcare. The discovery of new medications, the personalization of medicinal treatments, and the acceleration of DNA sequencing are just a few of the many possible applications of this method. The potential of QC to transform compute-intensive healthcare tasks like drug-discovery, personalized-medicine, DNA-sequencing, medical-imaging, and operational-optimization is the primary focus of this survey paper, which offers the first comprehensive analysis of QCs diverse capabilities in improving healthcare systems. After a thorough literature study, we created taxonomies on the healthcare QC paradigm’s history and supporting technologies, applications, needs, architectures, security, outstanding questions, and future research prospects. We hope that by conducting this survey, researchers with varying levels of experience in quantum computing and healthcare will better understand the state of the art, assess opportunities and threats, and make informed decisions as they develop novel architectures and applications for this emerging field. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Scopus"

This shift facilitates the transition from a specialized intelligence approach, where artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms handle isolated tasks, to artificial general intelligence (AGI)-driven networks, where agents possess broader reasoning capabilities and can manage diverse network functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel agentic paradigm that combines LLMs with real-time optimization algorithms towards Trustworthy AI, defined as symbiotic agents. Optimizers at the LLM's input-level provide bounded uncertainty steering for numerically precise tasks, whereas output-level optimizers supervised by the LLM enable adaptive real-time control. We design and implement two novel agent types including: (i) Radio Access Network (RAN) optimizers, and (ii) multi-agent negotiators for Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). We further propose an end-to-end architecture for AGI-driven networks and evaluate it on a 5G testbed capturing channel fluctuations from moving vehicles. Results show that symbiotic agents reduce decision errors fivefold compared to standalone LLM-based agents, while smaller language models (SLM) achieve similar accuracy with a 99.9 % reduction in Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) resource overhead and in near-real-time (near-RT) loops of 82ms. A multi-agent demonstration for collaborative RAN on the real-world testbed highlights significant flexibility in service-level agreement and resource allocation, reducing RAN over-utilization by approximately 44 %. Drawing on our findings and open-source implementations, we introduce the symbiotic paradigm as the foundation for next-generation, AGI-driven networks-systems designed to remain adaptable, efficient, and trustworthy even as LLMs advance.

To address the challenges of resource scarcity and highly dynamic topologies, the integration of software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) technologies into LEO satellite networks has become imperative. We proposes a hybrid centralized-distributed software-defined LEO satellite network architecture. Within this framework, This study focuses on the service function chain (SFC) deployment problem in LEO space-ground integrated networks. time-expanded graphs (TEGs) are employed to model satellite networks with dynamic topological variations, aiming to satisfy diverse user requirements while jointly optimizing resource consumption costs and service latency. The problem is formulated as a weighted sum minimization of resource consumption costs and service latency, and this problem is proven to be NP-complete. Subsequently, we integrate the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient method with multi-agent techniques to design a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning SFC deployment (MADRL-D) framework for optimizing our objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MADRL-D framework outperforms existing alternatives in terms of resource utilization efficiency, resource consumption costs, and service latency. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Scopus"

This study aimed to demonstrate the potential of non-destructive spectral analysis combined with Agentic Artificial Intelligence for automating the identification of soil heaving potential, providing a transformative approach to soil assessment in railway construction. A robust AI-agent was developed to predict soil heaving potential across temperature regimes (ranging from 0°C to -5°C and back), enabling characterization of the relative acoustic compressibility coefficient (β) based on the physical and mechanical properties of the soil. The main objective was to develop a framework that integrated spectral reflectance data with machine learning algorithms to predict soil heaving potential and reduce the reliance on traditional invasive methods. The experimental setup employed digital techniques to process and record longitudinal and transverse acoustic pulse signals reflected from piezoelectric sensors mounted on soil specimens. The processed signals were automatically transferred via a USB adapter to a PC for further analysis by the AI-agent. Acoustic diagnostics of the soils were performed using Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) Spectral Analysis, followed by correlation of waveform spectra with heaving deformation. The AI-agent utilized a hybrid architecture combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) algorithms to address the complexities of heterogeneous soil data and multifaceted prediction tasks—including heaving classification and deformation regression—while mitigating overfitting. Soil heaving potential was accurately predicted by the AI agent, with minor variations attributed to equipment sensitivity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Scopus"

The proposed system uses Blueprint Personas to capture detailed patient profiles, including clinical, behavioral, and emotional traits. These profiles guide an intelligent agent that interacts with patients and healthcare professionals to provide context-sensitive support. Personalization is achieved through an ontology-based reasoning layer that interprets user needs and integrates real-time data from electronic health records, wearable devices, and environmental sources. To promote transparency and foster long-term user engagement, the system includes a formal trust modeling component based on a Reference Ontology of Trust (ROT), allowing the system to flexibly tailor communication strategies in response to user feedback and evolving trust levels. A simulated scenario involving a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates how the system delivers proactive and personalized healthcare interventions, such as medication reminders and air quality alerts. While the architecture is modular and designed for scalability, it has not yet been deployed in real-world clinical settings. Empirical validation and integration with clinical platforms remain part of future work.
